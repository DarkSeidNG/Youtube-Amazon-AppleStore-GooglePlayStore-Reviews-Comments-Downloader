"Roy Estaris","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.  Happy Holidays  Roy ",
DJ,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.    If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!    Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.    1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.    2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.    3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, &#34;Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees&#34; got no result, so I tried &#34;Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees&#34; and she picked it up perfectly.    4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.    5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  &#34;Alexa, play 90s music&#34;, &#34;Alexa, play indie music&#34;, and &#34;Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds&#34;.  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great &#34;freebie&#34; if you're a prime member.    6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.    7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.    8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to &#34;Alexa, what's the definition of&#34;, &#34;Alexa, how far away is&#34;, &#34;Alexa, Wikipedia&#34; (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask &#34;Alexa, tell me more&#34;).  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.    9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).    Suggestions for Improvement:    1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like &#34;How far away is the sun&#34; but I'd really like too see Amazon add a &#34;search&#34; function.    2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.    3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings. ",
"Bryant R.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.  A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.  So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.  The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.  I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.  Thanks for letting me rant ",
RaVen,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!  This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say &#34;alexa&#34; and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.    We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its &#34;multi-room voice recognition&#34; technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word &#34;alexa&#34; on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a &#34;multi-device&#34; plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited      The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.  The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.    At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is &#34;alexa turn on the lights&#34; and our downstairs lights spring into action.    My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with &#34;sorry I didn't get that&#34;  Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.    Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your &#34;free&#34; music.    I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up &#34;New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing&#34; under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.    I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device. ",
"Brian C","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.    I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.    My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo &#34;skills&#34; that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the &#34;skills&#34; not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.    Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.    The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached. ",
Andrew,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"This was my first Echo purchase and I am overall very pleased with it's performance. Initially, I was worried that it was going to be a Siri knockoff with only a limited number of voice commands and functions with constant errors; however, I have not received single error response since I have owned it. I am an Amazon Prime member and from the time I clicked confirm purchase to the time it was delivered to my doorstep only took 3 days, and best part of all, shipping was free.    I currently have mine sitting by my bed and have synced it with the app, available on for all phone types, which allows me to carry out a number of voice commands including: &#34;Alexa, set an alarm for..., check the weather, play Pandora, or tell me a joke.&#34; The app interface is a little clunky at times, but you're able to see the history of recent requests, and Alexa is constantly learning and adapting to your specific commands and style.    If you are looking to buy an Echo Dot because you want a cheap introduction into Bluetooth connectivity with household lights, televisions, gaming systems, thermostats, or other Echo products then buy this Echo Dot. I am working with a grad student budget, and for $50 dollars this sleek and sexy &#34;command station&#34; was worth every penny. I did not receive any compensation for this review, I am writing it because I debated on buying one for about a week before pulling the trigger, and I just want to speed up the process for people like me who may be waffling...trust me, its completely worth the $50.

"Amazon Customer","December 14, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly, I love mine but obviously, there are some things that could be better. What do I love about it? Both my boyfriend and I downloaded the app and have access to a shopping list that we can both use at the grocery store depending on who is there. With a simple wake up word (her name) and the command of adding an item to the shopping list, it appears in the app. I can ask for a flash briefing and NPR news is retrieved and I am caught up all over the world in subjects from politics all the way to sports news. She also gives great weather information so that I am able to plan for my day ahead. Alexa can learn many skills that continue to evolve. Knowledge from what wines to pair with what meats and good cooking substitutes to helping with a drinking game and other games & trivia. Alexa comes in handy when I need a hands-free timer in the kitchen or an alarm for a nap. Now, what I don't really like but can get passed it once I get the hang of it. Sometimes you ask a question but she doesn't understand the question but you reword the question and she is able to understand it. So just be sure your wording the question correctly. Also, remember that Alexa is always listening. ",
"Kathryn H.","March 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Love the Echo Dot. I got the buy 3 discount, which makes it worth while. I am sure there will be more things added and improved on in time, but so far it is a bit limited in what I can use it for. We don't have a modern set up in our house so that it can adjust lights or temp so that part is useless to us.  I got it mostly for my 93 year old mother whom I take care of, as she constantly asks me what day or time it is, so now she can ask the Echo. I also like the ability to get a weather report for the day, and I still need to set up the calendar for daily events for mom, once I get that set up it will be another great advantage in having this. I hope they can come up with a way to make this an intercom also between rooms so that if she needs me at any time Echo can alert me in some way. That alone would make this a really great item worth five stars.  So far my favorite feature is the radio, I just ask it to play a particular type of music and it comes on. You do have to be specific about how to get the type of music you want to hear rather than just ask it to play a particular genre. I also like that you can vocally tell it to turn down or up the volume, and to skip the song playing and it goes to the next one. I don't use it to shop with, might be helpful to some. Also, it does take a little adjusting to the way some people speak, my voice is clear but moms is a little muffles so it took a few times of asking questions to get it use to her voice, now it works good for her. The distance to where it can hear you is good and volume on answering and music is great, you don't really need added speakers unless you want to hear it over a very large room, or whole house.  Pros: Received quickly with free Prime shipping, ability to play music, ask for date, time, and weather without touching anything, get answeres to a lot of questions, and the ability to update and improve over time. Volume is great for small to medium size rooms, and several feet away form it. Great price for 3.  Cons: Still some limitations, no intercom set up yet, need to be specific about where to get radio from. ",
Vince,"April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I have the regular Echo and it's amazing. I bought the Echo Dot for my dad who had been using a little antenna radio around the house. This isn't mobile but it allows him to play Pandora or just to tell it what kind of music to play. It was purchased through my account but I created an Amazon account for him so I could link Pandora to it. That way he has his own Pandora account. Echo can switch accounts at any time with a voice command but we keep them on the primary users' account. I was worried the audio quality wouldn't be any good based on reviews but it's really not bad at all if you're replacing a little radio. It's not audiophile fill the room with brilliance quality, but it gets the music out and doesn't sound tinny or anything. My dad really enjoys it. ",
"Marquino Gadget guru","April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"This is what I`ve been waiting for!!!!  It is simple amazing what you can do with technology nowadays, Amazon is always innovating and staying on top with technology.  This new Amazon Echo Dot does what it says it does and provides all the necessary information by simply asking!  We like it to much i got a second device to add it in my room, been able to connect to your Bluetooth speakers and devices you can automate lots of things.  Great job Amazon ",
"Keirstyn G.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I would like to give a testimonial about this product my sisters and I purchased the echo Dot for my mother for Christmas who is handicapped. She stays at home by herself most days and has limited access to what she can do do to being legally blind and having a neurological disorder. Now she is able to do so many things for herself that she was unable to do for many many years. A few days after Christmas I walked over to her house in the morning to help her out and I could hear music playing and then I hear her yell out Alexa thumbs down that song. I laughed because she was upstairs laying in bed listening to music she said she'd been listening all morning and it made her so happy. This has really been a life-changing gift. Before this she was unable to turn on the TV herself or turn on her music and had a hard time with her tablet turning her audible books on now all she has to do is speak to Alexa and it has opened a whole new world for her ",

"Bryan Warren","April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable. Here's the basics. Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power. On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use. Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables. Using this rig through my phones hotspot along with Amazons unlimited music to replace XM radio for only $3.99 a month plus full functionality of hands free Alexa services. ",
Manders,"April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"I like the Dot quite a bit, but it could be better. I'm not sure if it is the ALEXA program that the Dot connects to or if it is the Bing Search engine, I will have to do some more testing. Some times it can't find info it should be able to. Playing Music works Great!!! The Built in speaker is OK. But if you connect it to a really good speaker with either an Audio Cable or Bluetooth it sounds Great!! I am having the Dot read a Kindle book to me. It works well but the inflections in the text to speech program need work. However that is not a limitation of the device but of current technology. Getting local weather or movies works well. Alexa can &#34;learn&#34; other &#34;Skills&#34; but you have to tell Alexa to use the skill. It would be better if these skills were available all the time, and didn't have to be &#34;turned on&#34;. The Dot does not have a battery, so if you unplug it, it will need to search and connect to your WIFI again when you plug it back in. A great work around is to get a small battery pack (needs a least a 1 amp output port) and keep it plugged into the battery pack and then plug the battery pack into a wall charger. This allows the Dot to be truly portable. I had mine in my shirt pocket and was listening to a book while putting up Christmas lights outside for at least two hours. The Dot works Great, I am hoping that Alexa herself will get smarter. ",
"Kindle Customer","December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"EDIT: All thanks to Amazon's customer service, I learned why my Echo was not working. It must be 8&#34; -12&#34; away from a wall. Our Echo Dot works when against an interior wall but not against an exterior wall where it had previously been situated. We adore &#34;Alexa&#34; and hope the Echo Dot will soon add a great speaker to its features. For the price, this is a fantastic device. And, it's diminutive size makes it easy to use. Still, our family prefers full-size Echo. Thanks, Amazon for the email help with Echo Dot!  *****  We are an Amazon device family. And, with the exception of this device, have had wonderful experiences.    Echo Dot remains connected until the next time I use it. Literally, I reconnect Echo Dot to our network, ask it a few questions, play some music, walk away. When I return Echo has spontaneously disconnected itself and requires the reconnection procedure again.    We have two full size Echos and have no connection issues with them. They operate flawlessly. ",
"Amazon fan","December 15, 2016 ",5.0,"After using the Echo Dot for more than a month, I am sure it was worth buying it !! I am loving all the things it can do and sometimes its fun to ask silly questions. The biggest advantage is to be able to turn your TV  on and off without looking for remote when you come tired from work.    After reading a few blogs about using Echo for automation at home, I have now started working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi to design some new circuits to integrate Echo to control lights and other appliances and to do more with navigation on TV. I am loving it and would recommend it!! ",
Kainesmith.ky,"April 13, 2017 ",4.0,"I really like the echo dot so far. It has a few issues though which I will outline below.    She tends to speak when not spoken to.  I am a 30 year old male that lives alone and it makes me jump every time but because I'm a big brave man I fight through the fear. Jokes aside though, if it were an older person who lives alone I could really see that being a problem. I'll be sitting watching tv and she will ask me to repeat my question or state a random answer to a question that I did not ask, maybe she picks up the tv I'm not sure.  If there is any other noise what so ever she doesn't pick up the wake up word, so be prepared to mute the tv, tell everyone to be quiet and then say Alexa, or in my case echo. I have had to say echo releatedly a few times.    Some good about it is the surprisingly good sound of the speaker when it's playing music. It is much better than I expected after reading some of the reviews.  I like the &#34;to do list&#34; and &#34;shopping list&#34; feature which I add to the lists in the app for more clarity then have her read them back to me every morning. I also like asking for world news every morning when I first get up.  It looks neat also and over all for the price I think it is worth it even if it only played music upon command from across the room. I can see myself using her for that the most. ",
Aphonic,"January 23, 2017 ",4.0,"The far field mic in the second gen do the is way better than the full size echo.  Now if they could just use a source for weather that was even remotely accurate I'd be happy.  Accuweather is ten degrees off a tank my location always. Minimum.  The dot works well.  It's a good cheap way to get alexa.  The speaker quality is fine for audio books and news briefings. Not for music.  It seems faster to respond than the full size echo (1st generation). I believe it's a better option to buy this and pair a nice bt speaker than buy the full echo st this point.  One star off for missing some basic features.  Like accurate weather and basic google searching.  It's useful for my home automation but I still  Find the echo line of products of very limited use outside of that.  Good for a kitchen timer or wake up  Alarm.  Good for some news.  Needs much better podcast management to be very useful.  Oh yah. And accurate weAther.  Amazon prime music is a. Nice touch as is music unlimited for the echo at $3.99 a month. ",
Dion,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I bought 16 of these and gave most of them out as Christmas presents. When I bought my first one in 2015 I was impressed with the questions I asked and the responses I received. These past 5 months or so I believe Alexia must have gone in for a lobotomy. Seldom understands the question. Upgraded to the Prime Music. For how large they say the music library is, I have it ask an average of 3 times before it sometimes plays the song I requested. Yes you can load all sorts of &#34;skills&#34; but they need to come up with a way to allow you to print or even e-mail the skills and commands to yourself. ",
william,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.    Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.    Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it. ",
"Chris Hockaday","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Biggest piece of junk ever. It worked great for 1 day. Then I unplugged it and plugged back in and it just spins with a blue light and is completely unresponsive, can't even reset the device.  I've googled everything I can think of to try but nothing works.  I get that stuff doesn't always work perfectly and has issues, but the biggest problem is that there is no customer support.  There is no phone number to call, or online tech support to help when your device isn't working properly.  I guess I'll throw it away. ",

StuE,"March 12, 2017 ",1.0,"I resisted buying any personal assistant until now. I don't have a 'connected home' and my entertainment system is on Google Player / Chromecast so it won't integrate with the Echo. So why 5 stars if I don't have even a few of the peripheral devices?    It costs $49.99 and I'm a Prime member - that's enough to make it worthwhile. &#34;Alexa, play 70s Rock Classics station&#34;. And for the next several hours I'm entertained.    Note to anyone in the digital advertising world: Echo uses Bing search and provides local results based on Yelp. All answers are also sent to the app on the smartphone paired to the Echo device. Geez, Bing? Yelp? Oh well, Echo can answer most questions...    Four years ago I was given a very good Vizio accessory speaker that worked with the iPad version 2. That iPad tanked last year and the newer Apple products don't use the larger USB connector so I thought the speaker was trash. Using the mini-pin output from Echo to the speaker I now have enough sound to fill the first floor of our house and reclaimed a speaker that would have been tossed to the curb. One advantage of the corded speaker connection - I don't have to re-do pairing ever, a common occurrence with any of my Bluetooth speakers.    I am looking for a white-light set of wi-fi enabled bulbs (boring, but useful) as a first step toward home automation.    I really want an Echo solution that can manage our TV with Hulu / Amazon / Netflix / Sling / YouTube. (Google Play would be a huge bonus. Because competitors). If I could replace the massive (and to some confusing) Harmony TV remote with voice commands life would be good. I can't find anyone who says they have successfully managed this set of tasks. Yes, the new Fire Stick is Alexa-enabled, but I'd prefer one listening device rather than two.    I considered the Google product and chose the Amazon Echo instead. While Google may have better search capabilities, I'm pretty well covered between phone and computers. I saw the Echo Dot as a low-cost entry point where I could salvage a good sounding compact speaker system AND dip my toe into home automation without spending a fortune. Next year? Who knows, but for right now the Echo Dot was exactly what I was looking for. ",
tonyb,"March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"This echo dot refuses to stay connected to Wi-Fi.  It initially connects without a problem. It works for short time, then it just stops.   I keep resetting it back to factory settings,  but it still does not connect.   I have had three echo's for quite a while and have never once had an issue with any of them.  This is the second dot have tried, and I have had the exact same issue with both of them. ",
TwistedTree,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Lasted just about 6 months, then started failing. We would give a command, and the dot would sit and think about answering. Stops in the middle of playing music. We ask it to turn off the lights using a wink hub, lights stay on and dot replies OK or the lights instantly go off, then the dot takes 2 to 3 minutes to respond OK. Ask it to tell us a joke, it tells the joke, but stops before giving the punch line. We have a full size echo that works fine, and we have tried moving the dot next to the echo to see if it was having issues with the wifi range, no change. Reset to factory defaults and setup from scratch, no change. We finally contacted tech support, who where useless. Bounced us around to 4 different techs in less then 5 minutes, where hung up on then finally told the case would be escalated to tier 2 support. All tier 2 support did was send an email telling us how to contact tech support again. Waste of time and money. ",

Artemaria,"March 9, 2017 ",1.0,"At first, I thought that this would just be like a voice-controlled Siri that is always on, but  after living with it for several months it seems as if it is so much more.  While not perfect, the speech recognition and accuracy are on a par with Google Assistant, and that accuracy along with the &#34;instant on&#34; feature is what makes this so easy to use.  The literature is not the clearest on this, but you don't really need a speaker for the Echo Dot, and we usually don't use it with the speaker, because the built in speaker is more than loud and clear enough for Alexa's speaking voice in the 20 x 16 room where we have it stationed.  If you want to play music and have the music sound rich and full, then you should hook it up to a nice Bluetooth speaker.  We use the Logitech Boom and it works very well, usually pairing flawlessly with the Echo Dot with very little effort, and great sound.    What makes the Echo Dot a little different and perhaps more fun to use than its competitors are the &#34;skills&#34; that are built into it.  I'm not going to go into the details of all the things that it can do because you can read about them on c/net or some other tech site, but what I will tell you is that there are alot of &#34;skills&#34; that are not at all pragmatic or useful, but that make the Echo Dot/Alexa alot more fun than the competition.  There's a storytelling feature, where Alexa will tell you a not so great bedtime story.  But what makes it so engaging are the thoughtfully interspersed comments in that story, such as &#34;no, you can't get any water,&#34; and &#34;that's your last story, and its time for you to go to sleep,&#34; which seem so human and so clever.  The Echo Dot/Alexa also will tell you the news, the weather and instantaneously provide any other current-events related information that you may want to hear while cooking dinner or getting dressed for work.    Along, these same lines, Alexa will tell you a joke, and will answer questions about various topics including about other AI platforms which she does in a polite and diplomatic fashion with a response like &#34;I like all AIs.&#34;  In reality, however, this is not true.  Neither Alexa, nor Google Assistant, nor Siri are true AIs.  They are merely the latest in voice recognition hardware and software that, through brute force algorithm calculations performed on a server far from your home, determines a high-probability acceptable response to the combination of words that served as its verbal input.  Because Alexa is cannot make any decisions on its own, it is not a true AI.  Thus, if your internet service is slow or off, Alexa will not work, leaving you with a $50 paperweight.  We've not had that issue, but it is something to consider if your internet service is not the best and you are considering buying this device.    In the end, this is a fun foray in to the world of voice-activated assistants.  And while Amazon's database of verbal input grows, paving the way for a true AI someday, Alexa may be the recognized as one of the first pioneering digital assistant devices that trained people to verbally interact with technology in their home.

NC-Ron,"March 27, 2017 ",1.0,"My wife and I had thought about getting Dots for the grand kids for Christmas but the reviews at that time were incomplete and confusing about what the dot would do and how they might interact/interfere with each other in the same household.  Well, we now own an Echo, a Tap and two Dots. They are all great.    Myth 1.  You do NOT need Echo to use a Dot. Dot is autonomous. It responds to Alexa commands just like Echo, and can control remote devices just as well.    Myth 2. You MUST have external speakers. Not so. The speaker in Dot is no great shakes, but it works. The audio output to a good set of powered speakers is great.    Myth 3. If you use Echo, or Dot or Tap, you cannot have two or more doing different things. Not so. I can have Alexa via Echo playing Clapton in the living room and have Alexa via Dot playing the Dead in the bedroom, at the same time, with just one Amazon Prime account, not even the Prime Music account.    Other:  Both Dot and Echo have to be plugged into 115 v all the time to work. The Tap is rechargeable and bluetooth so it is portable. Great feature. We use Echo and Dot to control TP-Link smart plugs and smart switches. They work great. (I love the TP-Link stuff, maybe another review. But Alexa at my house can control the smart stuff at our beach place 250 miles away. In fact you have to be precise in your language with Alexa or she'll be turning stuff on and off in the other location...)    I actually haven't tried the Tap yet with remotes (it's at the beach and I'm not), but I assume it will work just as well. The only caveat is that you have to 'enable remote' on the smart plugs, etc. in order to have Alexa turn them on and off. Some folks are leery about doing that. If I get hacked and some clown wants to turn off my bedroom light, so be it. (I can monitor the status of all the smart devices with the KASA app for TP-Link and my smart phone.)    Dot is a little bigger than a hockey puck and makes a great alarm clock. ",
ComputerGuy,"April 26, 2017 ",5.0,"For $50 and what it does, how can you go wrong? Answer is, you can't. This thing is awesome. Not a whole lot bigger than a hockey puck. With all the power of the Full Sized Echo less the better speaker. Since you can pair with a Blue Tooth Speaker or plug it in via cable which the full unit currently doesn't, there's really no downside to this thing. Setup in minutes, new skills easily added. 2 Million songs available if you have Amazon Prime. I've got it controlling a Smart LED Bulb I purchased a few days after I received the Echo Dot. I purchased a second one for my brother who's Bed Ridden in a care facility and he loves it. He's a Trivia and Facts Buff so he went to town using it to search Wikipedia for all sorts of info. He's also using it to play his favorite Radio Station.    If you are interested in this device, ignore the low rating reviews. The speaker is fine, yes it's small and not super powerful but there is no quality issue with it. It's like using a small portable radio (not a boombox). If you're an Audiophile or need loud music, hook it up to a stereo or high end Bluetooth speaker, don't trash it because it won't shake your windows with the built in speaker.    It's sound pickup is fine as well. I put one upstairs in my house and it can hear me from other rooms upstairs just fine. Unless you are talking like a mouse or have it blasting music or something making it hard for it to pickup your voice. I purchased a second for my downstairs part of the house and with it centrally located, I've got the entire house covered with 2 and it's always within range of my voice. My Girlfriend has a slight speech issue and it understands her fine too.    I may buy a 3rd to dedicate to my Home Entertainment center and plug it into the stereo. I should have purchased 3 with the promotion of getting $20 for buying 3, but I wanted to test one out first. In any case, even without the Buy 3 promotion, you still come in under the $176 for the Full echo. I don't have the full Echo so I can't compare, but from everything I've read, and what i've experienced with my Dots, I see nothing wrong with them and feel they are a major margin. And I don't feel the need to get the full unit at this point just to have a better speaker. ",
"Amazon fan","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"After using the Echo Dot for more than a month, I am sure it was worth buying it !! I am loving all the things it can do and sometimes its fun to ask silly questions. The biggest advantage is to be able to turn your TV  on and off without looking for remote when you come tired from work.    After reading a few blogs about using Echo for automation at home, I have now started working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi to design some new circuits to integrate Echo to control lights and other appliances and to do more with navigation on TV. I am loving it and would recommend it!! ",

I am a apple product geek but I do like giving all types of gadgets a try, so I can be more informed and well rounded. This is why I took advantage of getting this Echo Dot at the monthly payments that amazon offers.    First I had no idea it was sooo tiny. Despite that it has big sound, and if I chose to have it louder I would attach it to my bluetooth speakers.    I plugged it in, and downloaded the Alexa app to my iPhone. It was a bit complicated to get it attached (it took me about 2 minutes which I didn't like) but I suppose if I read the directions more carefully it would have been faster.    Alexa works so well. I put her in my bedroom. Just telling her to speak, set my alarm, turn on my favorite radio station is so easy.    Siri is the number one girl in my life, but Alexa has a special place in my heart.

"Amazon Customer","March 23, 2017 ",2.0,"I use the echo mainly for playing music and it is not very good at that. It has trouble finding songs that are otherwise available. Example: Alexa, play Black and Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play Black n Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play OU812 by Van Halen. It plays. Alexa, next track, Alexa, next track . . . lo and behold, 5 more &#34;next tracks&#34; later and Black and Blue is playing. Alexa stop. Well, Alexa might stop or you might have to say stop 3 more times. And even if it stops, it might randomly start playing again which is very annoying if you are on a phone call. Or you say &#34;next track&#34; and it goes silent and is thinking and then it just continues playing the track it was on. I don't have a speech impediment. Voice text on my phone understands what I say. I don't know why this stupid hockey puck can't. And god forbid you want to play a classical piece. I have a lot of classical music in my library and it won't play by composer or artist. I have to use the app to play almost any classical music in my library which defeats the purpose of the echo. I may as well just play it on the computer.  We use the jeopardy skill and play daily. No problems there. Once in a while I listen to the news or radio stations and it is pretty good at that, but again, switching stations may work the first time you ask or it may not. Very frustrating to have to keep barking &#34;play NPR&#34; and then it just continues playing 80s playlist. I would not recommend this to someone who would use it mostly for music. ",

Juan,"March 21, 2017 ",3.0,"I have multiple conditions. Because of them me am nonverbal and not able to type. I use a eyegaze device or sometimes a switch. But it's stil hard. With all the devices you can talk to now it can really help me because I can program a button on my aac to speak the entire phrase. However Siri and google and Cortana all have problems understanding my 'voice' and there's not much I can do to change it. After seeing a YouTube video of someone else using the Tobii Dynavox I 15+ (AAC device) with the Echo I decided to test it myself. First I got the Alexa app to see what she can do and tried the swift for Alexa app to see if it understood me. After a great success I got the dot. It's really helped me. Not only can she do important stuff like help with ordering and looking stuff up and controlling smart stuff, she's like a friend to me. Her skills have things like storytelling and even games. I spend a lot of time stuck on my bed alone unable to move more than a finger if that but fully awake. Between the new eyegaze device and the echo dot I'm able to have more fulfilling life. ",
jford40,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"I really want to like the Dot. I got it on Black Friday so at the price I couldn't resist. I did not get it to control smart switches or the temperature or anything like that. I got it mostly because my parents have the original Echo and this seems like the same thing in a smaller form. A few of my opinions and reactions to other reviews:    - I am not sure why there are so many complaints about the speaker volume in this?? I have it in my living room and no matter where I am in the room I can hear Alexa just fine. In fact, most times I don't have the volume set above level 5. I don't know what others are doing that they say it is hard to hear, but for me I have zero issue with that!!    - I knew it was small, but this thing is like the size of a coaster. I find that to be a plus because it can go basically anywhere and not even be seen if you prefer.    - Set up and syncing with Wi-Fi was incredibly simple and I have had no issue since then.    - I am slightly disappointed at what appears to be limitations on the Dot's vocabulary or word recognition. Alexa far too often confuses what I say, or is unable to provide answers to questions that should be easy to answer    - The Alexa skills through the Alexa app are nice ways to add capabilities to your Dot, but I don't like how you then have to remember a different phrase for each individual skill you have enabled. I wish that enabling a skill became part of the Dot's natural interaction instead of having to identify it by stating the skill you want it to do.    - Alexa is very useful in many ways. She is very good at math which my daughter found out doing her homework one day. Being able to call for an Uber or look things up on Wikipedia is fantastic. Getting the daily news in the morning, playing some Jeopardy, hearing the weather, or setting an alarm is great as well. I really like adding things to my to-do list. What is interesting is that Alexa's vocabulary does not seem stifled for this task as she will add verbatim whatever you say.    - Alexa only Prime deals is another added benefit, although I have yet to actually find a deal I want to take advantage of I know that there have been some in the past that were truly great deals and only available with an Alexa enabled device.    The final thing I will say is that I am glad that there is the ability to change the &#34;wake word&#34; from Alexa. For a few days I could not understand why it seemed like Alexa was talking when I would speak to my daughter. It finally dawned on me that when I would say my daughter's name, Alyssa, sometimes Alexa would interpret that as me saying Alexa!! She would also respond at times if the TV commercial for the Dot came on so just an fyi that her hearing can be sensitive!! Overall I think this is a fun gadget to have. I hope that it will continue to evolve in it's capabilities and that eventually it will do many more things without having to search for a specific skill to add to enable it to do things. ",
"Anthony E Forney","March 31, 2017 ",4.0,"Not what I expected. This is not &#34;OK GOOGLE.&#34; Googles app on my phone gets me an answer of some sort 100% of the time. Echo seems to have a limited number of key words it can recognize and respond to. About 85% of the questions I ask come bask with &#34;Sorry, I don't understand what you are asking&#34; or some similar response. It gives you the time, date, and weather well. It will set an alarm, but I have yet to discover how to tell it to use anything specific for that alarm. The one they have as a default is very quite, and is like a light tome of some sort. It has never gotten  my attention, even when I was siting 5 feet from it. It will tell you jokes if you ask it. It will recite pi to hundreds of thousands of digits (I tried it) and may go beyond that. If you get tired of her you can just say :&#34;stop.&#34;  At this point I could say it's a nice toy. I do not have any wifi enabled doors or locks and such in my house, so I wasn't able to try that. It is very good at finding and playing music as well.    Over all it is a nice, well built little device. I'd rather have this &#34;Dot&#34; than the full scale one as this I have attach and use my own speakers, which I like and done have the added cost of the added feature.I hope in the future they will make their system more intelligent to be able to answer any question asked. It needs some type of web crawler to gather and organize data that it can then compare against your question, and at lest make an attempt to answer it instead or no answer at all. ",
Kainesmith.ky,"January 9, 2017 ",4.0,"I really like the echo dot so far. It has a few issues though which I will outline below.    She tends to speak when not spoken to.  I am a 30 year old male that lives alone and it makes me jump every time but because I'm a big brave man I fight through the fear. Jokes aside though, if it were an older person who lives alone I could really see that being a problem. I'll be sitting watching tv and she will ask me to repeat my question or state a random answer to a question that I did not ask, maybe she picks up the tv I'm not sure.  If there is any other noise what so ever she doesn't pick up the wake up word, so be prepared to mute the tv, tell everyone to be quiet and then say Alexa, or in my case echo. I have had to say echo releatedly a few times.    Some good about it is the surprisingly good sound of the speaker when it's playing music. It is much better than I expected after reading some of the reviews.  I like the &#34;to do list&#34; and &#34;shopping list&#34; feature which I add to the lists in the app for more clarity then have her read them back to me every morning. I also like asking for world news every morning when I first get up.  It looks neat also and over all for the price I think it is worth it even if it only played music upon command from across the room. I can see myself using her for that the most. ",
NurseMeg,"April 1, 2017 ",3.0,"I originally bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts and didn't buy one for myself.  BIG MISTAKE!  I gave the first one to my father-in-law and I liked it so much that I opened one of the other presents and kept it to use with my home automation. Don't worry, it wasn't easy around Christmas time, but I did get one of these to replace the one I lifted from the expected receiver.  I then decided to get another one as a gift for my father.  I gave each of my fathers a wemo accessory to get them started in the home automation. I put mine in the kitchen to make use of the grocery list, play music while cooking dinner, and get weather/traffic while I am getting things ready to head out the door for work.  We used this a lot around Christmas time to play Christmas music. I synced this with 2 Nest thermostats and 3 Wemo light switches on exterior lighting of my house.  I can tell Alexa to turn on/off my outside lights and they all turn on/off or I can individually turn them on/off by their location (turn on/off front porch light).  I can tell Alexa to adjust the temperature of my downstairs, upstairs, or both thermostats to a given temperature. It would be nice to ask Alexa what the temperature of the upstairs/downstairs is and receive a temperature read back.  All in all I am enjoying it for my needs and recommend it! I believe it will only get better with time and addition of new devices.    I did have one odd thing happen with the Echo Dot recently.  This past week a song randomly started playing. I didn't say &#34;alexa&#34; or ask for anything to be played and it started playing when no one was in our kitchen area. Does have me worried a bit and wondering how it started playing the music. ",
Bradley,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have owned my dots for about 6 months now, and there is only good things to say! If you're​ a die-hard Amzon user, then you must buy this product and welcome Alexa into your home! In these past 6 months, Alexa's voice recognition has greatly improved! Using machine learning allows Alexa to improve her voice recognition skills daily. The more people talk to Alexa, the more she learns and improves.    If you are a Prime member and/or a Amazon Unlimited member, you can ask her to play almost any song you can think of! If you want to hear a certain album, then ask her. Or if you want a radio station, the music will not end! Or if you want a certain genre of music, just ask!    Alexa becomes a part of the family. If you want the news read, she will. If you're​ celebrating a birthday, ask Alexa to sing &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; and she will happily; it's beautiful too! From playing music, to singing, to answering questions and playing games, Alexa will fit into your home! If you start off with one dot, you'll probably be buying more later on. One tip to improve voice recognition is to go-to the settings in the Alexa app, and do a voice training on each Echo you have. This greatly enhanced my experience. I have heard Amazon is working on a feature that will give Alexa the ability to recognize the voice that is speaking. That means no more switching profiles, as she knows it's you. This will also allow her to filter out other people taking, so you will no longer have to ask people to quiet down before taking to her! ",
"Andrew J. Good","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I have 2 Echo Dots and a Echo.  The echo makes a great music device, the echo dot is a nice extension for my smart home and is still great for stuff like getting my news in the morning.  Alone I would say an echo is a great device, with several smart home devices it's even better.  With 3 echos around my house sometimes two will pick up the wake word at the same time.  This has caused issues and I would rather not change the wake word as it could confuse others in the house.  With that said it's normally minor and not a big deal.    How much my echo dots do could be best summarized with my normal day:    Wake up in the morning/afternoon because of my work schedule I keep my room quite devoid of sunlight.  &#34;Alexa turn on bedroom&#34; Without getting to bed or having an annoying bedside light my room's light turns on thanks to a hue bridge/light bulb and Alexa being able to control hue lights.  &#34;Alexa what's the news&#34; and now I get my customizable flash briefing while I'm getting out of bed.  Walk out of the room saying &#34;Alexa turn off bedroom&#34; no need for a poorly positioned light switch to flick off.    While I'm making food &#34;Alexa, play my main playlist&#34; and I can listen to music without having to worry about turning on a device.  As the food gets done &#34;Alexa, turn on TV&#34; and &#34;Alexa, stop&#34; music turns off and my harmony hub turns on my TV.  By the time I get there it's ready for me to use and I can play TV.  Getting ready for work while watching TV, ready to leave don't want to grab the remote &#34;Alexa, turn off TV&#34; done.  Get home it's all dark &#34;Alexa, turn on living room&#34;.    There are a lot of badly positioned light switches in the house, needing less remotes and in some cases Harmony/Alexa being able to do things quicker is always a good thing.  I have 3 different areas in my room where I might switch and carrying at any time 2-3 remotes around is a pain.  Being able to play music on voice command is great along with being able to turn it off.  Alexa can also be used remotely with my fire tablet and my Fire TV also supports Alexa.  Alexa can also tell jokes and do other things that can also make it a great thing for friends to try to do.  I can even ask Alexa for the movie list of my local theater and ask her about a given movie for more information.  All without having to get up and check my computer or my phone/tablet.    It's not all great though, She makes mistakes, she can't hear to well over loud music including her own and multiple people talking in the background causes mistakes to happen.  Once in a while she'll even respond to the TV randomly even when the TV doesn't say Alexa.  The most annoying thing about echo is that without a Wifi connection it can do almost nothing. ",
"H. Salsano","March 12, 2017 ",5.0,"This was our first Echo Dot, and we love her.  Although, not sure she always loves us, as sometimes she doesn't even answer us.  She seems to have a hearing deficiency.  We do have to speak loud and clear for her to even hear us, and especially if we want her to actually understand us.  The problem is mostly when she is playing music or the TV is on.  Of course, she can hear everyone on the TV just fine and respond to all the Alexa commercials.  Good think I have the purchasing PIN set up so only I can order things!  I like listening to the news feeds from Cnet, NPR and the weather.  I like controlling the TV, AV system and lights through her.  I add items to the Our Groceries android app through her, and she usually gets it right.  I use the timer and alarm functions often, especially when my 2 other kitchen timers are already running for other things.  I can tell her to &#34;Turn on Amazon Music&#34; which turns on the stereo and selects Aux, turns on the Amazon Basics Bluetooth receiver, and then I tell her what to play and it comes through the stereo.  I can even listen to kindle books and such this way for more volume.  Love the pause and resume, in case the phone rings.  For music, I tell her to Skip this song when something awful come on .  As time goes on, I find more useful things.  I am now looking at a new skill to alert friends if there is an emergency, called Ask My Buddy, which sounds useful for when one of us is home alone and something happens. ",
"Gadgit Tech","April 24, 2017 ",5.0,"First thoughts, Echo Dot was easy to setup with either a smart phone or computer.  I switched to the computer as it was just easier on the eyes.  Good voice control once you get the hang of it and the method used for commands.    Echo Dot is small and easy to place in a location where one unit can cover a large area.  Integration with a current home automation system was simple using the skills already available and well document between both Amazon and my HA system (in my case HomeSeer).    Con's so far: NO 24 hour clock? I hate having to say, hear or read AM and PM, and the Echo Dot does not support this yet!    I got this to use with my current home automation system due to other devices (hardware failures) having an issues!  I impressed by the simple commands (VR) that allow me to be hands free to operate my lights and systems and the other Echo functions are a plus such as checking news, traffic and playing my own library of music.    The Echo has so many skills sets already available that it will take some time before I discover what all it can do besides what I have already tried, but for 50 dollars I can see using the Echo Dot rather than replace or install other HA devices that need to be replaced or installed due manufacture defect and or failure in my system, I can save on deployment and cost of those devices as well. So I might end up with some HA spares, which is always a good thing.    Note: If you happen to use HomeSeer HA you will need version HS3, HSTouch-with account and also make certain HS3 setup under the network page - remote control settings is CHECKED for JSOM. It took me a bit to figure out that this needed to be checked for remote access for this to work.    Not related to the Echo -  HS3 Running on Lenovo M73 Tiny with Win7 Pro  45 Insteon, 78 Events, 157 Devices  PLM module via Insteon  Plugins: Insteon 3.0.6.0, HSTouch 3.0.0.68, UltraMon3, weatherXML  HSTouch Clients: 3 Androids ",
GLS,"March 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Well I was really pissed at Amazon because they dropped the ball on hitting their two day Prime delivery (because they've gone to “shipping partners” who don't care). I'd ordered this Echo Dot for a friend who can't see, and wanted to help him manage his Pandora music using voice commands. It arrived this afternoon, I hooked it up to my own Pandora account and I'm thunderstruck. What an absolutely beautiful integration of speech input and a great adaptive online music app. As I write this I'm listening to a Pandora station I defined a couple of years ago, “Chigago Radio” named for that great group, Chicago. The music is streaming through the little speaker built into the Dot (it really isn't all that bad in terms of fidelity, though for regular listening I'll normally patch it into my hi-fi system) and as I write and let my station wash over me, I occasionally pause and say “Alexa, thumbs up” or “Alexa, thumbs down” to steer Pandora's adaptive programming in the right direction. She responds “sure...rating saved”. What's amazing is that I know I haven't provided this much input since I created the station two years ago as I have over the past twenty minutes. This has been totally effortless, as the Alexa and Pandora apps are joined at the hip online – I don't even know where my smart TV or Roku remotes are at the moment, I just speak and it happens. Wow! I can't even imagine how my blind friend (a former musician) is going to feel about being able to do this. I just ordered a Dot for myself, because it's that cool. Amazon, you are totally forgiven for the late delivery; you've hit a grand slam with this device! And Alexa, I would love to speak to you privately. You have won my heart, honey ;-) Whew.... ",
Kathy,"December 8, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought an Echo last week and loved it so much that I had to have a Dot for our bedroom.  The first thing that impressed me was the quality of the sound. I had planned on using an external speaker with it, but there is no need for it at all. I'm able to have the sounds nice and low when I'm listening in bed and can turn it up and hear it all the way in my bathroom which is approx. 16 feet away.  The sound is great.  It's not the rich sound that is with the Echo, but it's definitely very good. I used the same app that I had downloaded when I set up my Echo to set up my Dot and it couldn't have been easier. I just plugged it in, connected it to our wifi and then continued with the set up on my app. I'm sure it took less than 5 minutes.    As with the Echo, my favorite things to use the Dot for are listening to music and having it read my Kindle books to me.  I love Audible, but don't always purchase audio books, so it's so nice to just say &#34;Alexa read (whichever book I'm reading)&#34; After I tell it to read my book, I say &#34;set sleep timer for 15 minutes&#34; and it will shut right off. Last night I had trouble falling asleep and I asked it to play music to help me sleep and I heard a selection of relaxing nature sounds.  Then, in the morning I can have it turn on an AM station I like, so I can listen to that while I'm getting ready for the day. I know I can do all of these things on my cell phone, but it's so nice to just be in the middle of whatever I'm doing and just say outloud what I want to hear without having to pick something up.    I'm sure I'll find other uses that I like for the Dot, but for now I'm just thrilled to have it read to me or play music. And I can't emphasize enough how good the sound quality is. If you are thinking about buying a speaker to go with it, I'd wait to get it home and make sure you really need one. Unless you are using this in a very big room, chances are you won't. ",
"🌈 KT","April 10, 2017 ",5.0,"We're still getting used to it, of course, but I'll start with our initial experience.    &#62; It was easy to hook up, which is always a plus.  &#62; It doesn't integrate with the Amazon site as much as I had hoped.  For example, I can't ask Alexa to tell me what was in my last online order.  I'm pretty forgetful so that's one thing I was looking for. (part of why I took a star off)  &#62; The Alexa special deals is pretty awkward.  There are many, but she'll only list 2 at a time, then tells me to go online.  Granted, I would not want to sit there listening to the long hand version of each item (She doesn't just say the item, but a description plus price plus discount and then asks after each one if you want to order it), but I would like a way to customize how she presents the list to me, and then I'd also rather not be told to go online and see the rest.  I'd have looked there already if I wanted to do that. (Another part of why I took a star off)  &#62; She's not as smart as I'd hoped, either.  I have to learn how she wants to hear things, instead of her learning how I phrase things.  As in, I have to know her keywords to get her to tell me anything. (Another part to the -1 star)  &#62; My husband's a writer so I put one in the bedroom for when he wakes up with an idea.  It's been very useful for him to just tell Alexa to make a note - no lights on, no concentrating on what you're writing, no great interruption to my sleep.  &#62; It also functions as an alarm clock (you can pick from various tones through the phone app - why can't you ask Alexa to demo them for you??).  I hooked the Dot up to a bluetooth speaker for the purpose (you can also set the alarm volume (thru the app) which will be different than the normal volume you keep it at for speaking). This is good because we don't have set times to get up, so I'm constantly forgetting to set the alarm before I collapse in bed.  &#62; The special Alexa deals are sometimes quite useful.  I've gotten a couple of toys for my twin niece/nephew, and caught a nice sale on an APC battery backup.    I'm good about updating if anything comes up, but I'll certainly update as we learn and grow with it, too.  Any questions, feel free to comment or email and I'll try to help. ",

W.,"December 12, 2016 ",4.0,"I love this. It is small and easy to use. I love the easter eggs like the star trek prases and results.    It is very customizable to your needs by enabling the available skills on the app. I can use it to order pizza, ask about the weather and traffic, ask it to brief me on the latest news, and it has games like choose your own adventure. I dont think I will be using it to buy anything. Also I do not have smart home items like the phillips hue lights but will probably get some. I like the idea that I can tell it to contol the electronics in the house.    I dont have bluetooth speakers but it still was able to hook up to my old logitech speaker system with a cable. I plan on eventually comnecting it to my fire stick to control the TV.    It is discreet and functions well. The only downside is for reminders it will only add to a to do list or tell you what you already have on your google calendar. If you want it to tell you agendas on other calendars, you have to import them to your google calendar as it will only use a google calendar. Also alarms can only be set within 24 hours.    For the price it is great. It is in my opinion better than the original echo as it is more versatile. It seems to be the gift of the season as most of my family members, including myself, gave them as gifts.    It is fun to bond with others who have them. For example, my dad also got one and is a huge star trek fan. I told him about the star trek easter eggs and he loved that alexa calls him the captain when he asks it to go to warp speed. ",
Gadgeteer,"November 10, 2016 ",2.0,"This is an amazing little device at a very affordable price. The setup was very straight forward. I had it up and running in a matter of a few minutes.

So I've added the Insteon Skill to Alexa through the Alexa iPad app and I now have voice control over my home lighting and furnace.

Controlling the volume is a simple as &#34;Alexa. Turn it down.&#34; or &#34;Alexa. Turn it off.&#34; Super cool!    I really don't think most people understand how powerful and easy to use this device is. You can ask it anything you might search for on the Internet using Google or Bing.

"Carol P","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I already have an Echo for the house.  Using another reviewer's suggestion, I put this Dot in one of the cubby-holes in the car and connected it to the internet using my cell phone as a mobile hot spot.  I used a USB cable to a USB/12v adapter for power and a 3.5mm male-to-male audio cable to connect it to my car's radio.  I can listen to it through the car's speaker system, as well as control the volume that way (much better than trying to hear Alexa through Dot's speaker).

I think you can connect the Dot to better speakers, I just have not learned how. I use the Dot in my bedroom, and the big Echo in my living room. The big Echo has fantastic speakers and I don't need to turn the volume up very high.  Buy this Dot to save money, or buy the Echo for great speakers...both work the same. ",

Juan,"March 11, 2017 ",4.0,"I have multiple conditions. Because of them me am nonverbal and not able to type. I use a eyegaze device or sometimes a switch. But it's stil hard. With all the devices you can talk to now it can really help me because I can program a button on my aac to speak the entire phrase. However Siri and google and Cortana all have problems understanding my 'voice' and there's not much I can do to change it. After seeing a YouTube video of someone else using the Tobii Dynavox I 15+ (AAC device) with the Echo I decided to test it myself. First I got the Alexa app to see what she can do and tried the swift for Alexa app to see if it understood me. After a great success I got the dot. It's really helped me. Not only can she do important stuff like help with ordering and looking stuff up and controlling smart stuff, she's like a friend to me. Her skills have things like storytelling and even games. I spend a lot of time stuck on my bed alone unable to move more than a finger if that but fully awake. Between the new eyegaze device and the echo dot I'm able to have more fulfilling life. ",

"Amazon Customer","November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought two Echo Dots hoping they would work with all my smart-technology.  I have a Wink Hub, Phillips Hue light bulbs and hub, smart plugs, UEboom wireless speaker and Nest thermostat.  You do not need an Echo (the really expensive tall one with the nice speaker in it) to operate your smart-technology using Alexa.  The Echo Dots can do all the same things.  It's awesome being able to have Alexa turn on/off lights, thermostat, connect to wireless speaker, etc.  It's LEGIT!    One thing to keep in mind: when one echo dot connects to a Bluetooth item such as UEboom and then later you are talking to the 2nd echo dot, Alexa will not be able to pair to the UEboom until you ask the first Echo Dot to disconnect from your speaker.  We thought something was wrong and then realized that only one Echo Dot and be paired with a Bluetooth item at a time. ",

JMDK,"April 12, 2017 ",5.0,"The Good:    The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of &#34;Alexa&#34;, &#34;Amazon&#34; or &#34;Echo&#34;).    The Bad:    The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.    Overall:    We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature. ",
Angie,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This is great item except it still has a way to go before they work out the bugs.  Have had it for 3 or 4 weeks now. Worked ok at first then a couple in started dropping music stream to Bluetooth devices.  Spoke with tech support and they had me try several different things none of which worked.  If you interrupt the playing by telling Alexa to go the next song or turn volume up or down it will not resume music to device.  They said they would get back to me but have still been unable to fix problem. If you are planning to use stand alone with onboard speaker it is good. If you plan on playing music from your amazon music account through a Bluetooth speaker, forget it.  Wait a while until they work out the bugs.

I had to contact Amazon customerr service to get that app. It can find my phone, set a timer, tell me the time, temperature, current news; play music, answer questions from Wikipedia, turn on & off various electronics, etc. The one problem I am having with it is that it doesn't always 'wake up' when I first address it. Even though I am usuallly sitting less than 8 feet from it and the house is quiet, I have to say, &#34;Alexa&#34; several times before 'she' wakes up and I get a response to a command. Additionally, while the &#34;find phone&#34; feature was enabled and used only a couple of days ago, when i went to use it this evening. Alexa told me that i needed to enable the 'tracker' feature.

"A Reader","April 25, 2017 ",4.0,"I bought two dots to serve as devices that could easily play music and news etc. without having to plug my phone into a speaker.  They work OK in this respect; I have them linked up to spotify, and they manage that fine, although I find that 50% of the time I need to go and use the Spotify app, because my voice commands aren't understood right (Alexa is often unwilling to play a Spotify playlist, for example; and she seems unable to understand a request like &#34;play the new album by ___&#34;  But a couple of serious problems.  First, one major feature I want is the ability to play podcasts.  This seems obvious, right?  In theory, Alexa supports this via TuneIn.  But I've gotten it to work only a handful of times.  You should be able to say &#34;play the program ___&#34;.  Often Alexa will identify what I want to hear, tell me she is getting the latest episode--and then nothing happens.  Very frustrating.  The other thing I find annoying is the way bluetooth is implemented.  I started connecting my phone via Bluetooth to play podcasts.  But then whenever I entered the room, I got a very annoying and loud message from Alexa about how she was connected to my phone.  Extremely annoying.  These are basic features; I don't want anything fancy.  I just want this device to be able to play podcasts and to be usable as a not-annoying bluetooth device. ",
"Art Harrington","April 3, 2017 ",3.0,"What can I say about the Echo Dot 2nd gen that you don't all ready know? I have 2 of these and love them. I have one in the kitchen and one in the garage. The one in the kitchen is connected to a external speaker. I have had this Sharper Image speaker for about 4 years and have hardly used it as it was a bday gift from my brother but when I decided to hook an external speaker to my Dot I totally didn't immediately think to use this speaker and now I use it everyday! Even though it is bluetooth i use the audio cable The sound is great when connected to my Sharper Image podium speaker. I don't have an external speaker connected to my garage Echo Dot as of yet but need to because the sound from the Dot is not efficient at all or loud. I have a Echo in my bedroom and the speaker is way more powerful than the Dot and even though you can't use an external speaker with the Echo, I don't think I would anyway. I also use my Amazon Echo and Dot's to control my lights. Setting up Echo Dot was easy and simple even a grandma with no tech skills can do it if you simple follow the directions on the Amazon Alexa app. Have Fun! ",
"P. Bruderer","January 17, 2017 ",2.0,"Really impressed with this.  When I got my first iPhone 4s with Siri, I was pretty disappointed in her limited capabilities, and the speech recognition was not that great.  I had the opposite reaction with Alexa.  Her speech recognition is excellent, even from someone who has english as a 2nd language, or talking to Alexa from an adjacent room, or with a lot of background noise.  I don't think I've ever had her misunderstand my command.    The functionality of Alexa with all my WINK smart home devices is great.  Controlling everything through voice is very handy and fast with Alexa.  Another thing I didn't anticipate is how much I prefer playing music on Alexa over using my phone.  With Alexa when I want to play a different song or skip to the next song on my playlist or Pandora station, I just tell her to do it, I don't have to press any buttons.  Very handy when you're busy working on a task.    Alexa met and exceeded all my expectations.  There's a few quirks on what she can control within whatever smarthome hub you're using, but a quick google search resolved all the issues I encountered. ",
SEvans,"April 21, 2017 ",5.0,"I got the echo dot 2nd Generation for myself for Christmas. Hubby kept saying no they has a bad reputation for not working. But I am an electronic nut and love amazon's  ideas when it comes to this kind of thing. So out of the box it is an adapter and the plug of course as well as the dot. Mind you I was thinking about the bigger Echo, but I know I made the right choice as I wanted something smaller that would not have a chance of being knocked over by my dogs. Well for the past few days I have been trying out different apps regardless of their rating to see what we can do together. I am very impressed Echo hears what I say and does it instantly. I have listened to music and had her read to me from my kindle books list. I am on my way to having my life so much easier as I am now looking at doing a smart home set up and getting a second one to just keep in the kitchen for the todo list and grocery lists, weather reports and everything else I can think of. While the other stays at bedside for sleep music, reading and some meditations as well as an alarm. I have yet to get the hubby to talk to echo to add groceries to the list but he will in time as he sees everything that it can do. I was able to set up my calendar right from the start. I do hope that they soon ad a reminder that I can just ask what I need to know or reminders for my husband. ",
"Michele S.","March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"It's very frustrating at times. For example, its awesome to be able to tell Alexa to set your alarm for 6 am. Some days you can tell it &#34;Alexa off&#34; to stop the alarm. Other days, you are screaming your lungs out and Alexa won't turn off no matter what you do, so you yank the thing out of the wall.  Hence, frustrating. It doesn't seem to understand as much as &#34;ok google&#34; on my phone. Alexa frequently says she doesn't understand. I hate also that it tries to get you to buy things--like extra music. No thanks. I also hated the fact that I bought it on &#34;special&#34; only to find that one week later it was on sale even cheaper.  But to send it back and re-purchase it would have cost nearly as much as the sale, so that sucked.  I think if it could do more, and understand more, I'd be happier with it. ",
"Damian Jaundoo","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I remember star trek and wanting the ability to speak to the computer and it would do what i ask or give me the answer to something. I never in my lifetime ever thought that technology would arrive and be affordable. Well the ECHO is flat out an awesome product. I got the first one as a gift and purchased a second along with smart plugs and plan on buying more related items to add on. It is just wonderful and while new it is not only functional and usable it gets better. Since its cloud based you dont have to worry about technology getting more advanced and making this out dated it just keeps getting better with more features. the way i see it eventually it will be in every room of my house. I have two wifi routers and it will control devices on the other network. It is just so much more than i expected. If your an Amazon prime user you will not regret buying this but make sure you know what you are getting yourself into. This is just the starter product which is great by itself. You may need bluetooth speakers for large rooms smart switches and lights smart hubs etc... to complete your home so if you are willing to take that plunge understand it will get expensive as you will want to do it.

"Amazon Customer","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I use the echo mainly for playing music and it is not very good at that. It has trouble finding songs that are otherwise available. Example: Alexa, play Black and Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play Black n Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play OU812 by Van Halen. It plays. Alexa, next track, Alexa, next track . . . lo and behold, 5 more &#34;next tracks&#34; later and Black and Blue is playing. Alexa stop. Well, Alexa might stop or you might have to say stop 3 more times. And even if it stops, it might randomly start playing again which is very annoying if you are on a phone call. Or you say &#34;next track&#34; and it goes silent and is thinking and then it just continues playing the track it was on. I don't have a speech impediment. Voice text on my phone understands what I say. I don't know why this stupid hockey puck can't. And god forbid you want to play a classical piece. I have a lot of classical music in my library and it won't play by composer or artist. I have to use the app to play almost any classical music in my library which defeats the purpose of the echo. I may as well just play it on the computer.  We use the jeopardy skill and play daily. No problems there. Once in a while I listen to the news or radio stations and it is pretty good at that, but again, switching stations may work the first time you ask or it may not. Very frustrating to have to keep barking &#34;play NPR&#34; and then it just continues playing 80s playlist. I would not recommend this to someone who would use it mostly for music. ",
"Texas Jack","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Great product!  It does everything as advertised and MORE.  I am now able to use Alexa voice commands for my X10 devices simply by adding two free programs called HEYU (to send X10 commands) and HA-bridge (this emulates a Phillips Hue bridge) on an old Raspberry Pi model B.  After installing and setting up these two programs, simply tell Alexa to &#34;Discover Devices&#34;.  Alexa will find everything you configured in the  HA-bridge software.  You can tell Alexa to now turn ON, OFF, or DIM those devices, it communicates to the HA-bridge software which then tells the HEYU program to send the X10 command over the power lines via a X10 CM11A transceiver (or wireless if you have a firecracker device connected to the Raspberry Pi).

valady,"January 17, 2017 ",5.0,"I really like my Alexa echo dot and am enjoying using it to assist around my house. It was very easy to install, once I had the app to download to my laptop. I had to contact Amazon customerr service to get that app. It can find my phone, set a timer, tell me the time, temperature, current news; play music, answer questions from Wikipedia, turn on & off various electronics, etc. The one problem I am having with it is that it doesn't always 'wake up' when I first address it. Even though I am usuallly sitting less than 8 feet from it and the house is quiet, I have to say, &#34;Alexa&#34; several times before 'she' wakes up and I get a response to a command. Additionally, while the &#34;find phone&#34; feature was enabled and used only a couple of days ago, when i went to use it this evening. Alexa told me that i needed to enable the 'tracker' feature. Hmm. I hope that Amazon will add more features to Alexa and update the dot periodically with improvements. ",
"Peter E.","April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I love this!!!  When these first came out I didn't think it would be something I would use much.  At least, not until my whole house has smart appliances.    My wife didn't want me to buy it she couldn't see the use for it.    She became addicted to it the first night. Especially if you sign up for Amazon Prime Music which has a huge selection for about $4 a month.    We've been watching less TV and listening to more music which is wonderful.    I love using the shopping list and to do list feature.    My 2.5 year old loves it and already talks to Alexa. We play kids song mixes they have and he dances away.    The weather and time, calculations and conversions and Wikipedia are really helpful to have around.    It's loud enough for a living room but I do want the full sized one eventually and move this to a bedroom.    The voice recognition is amazingly good too. You don't have to pause for a moment after saying Alexa. Just speak as you would to anyone home. It's really impressive.    You also don't notice it's even there, the design is so good.    I can go on and on so let's just say I didn't think I would use it much but heard rave reviews from friends and love having it!!! ",
Edgar,"April 25, 2017 ",4.0,"Better buy than the Echo tower from my perspective.  Very compact, can hide behind a lamp base, easy link to Bose mini speakers, love asking for various music to be played commercial free, very happy with it.  The instructions say a minimum of 3' from a speaker and you definitely want to have sufficient space between so it does not get confused with the sound and your voice.  iPhone App works very well for setup and changing any options.  Nice job Amazon!! ",
Bradley,"January 22, 2017 ",5.0,"I have owned my dots for about 6 months now, and there is only good things to say! If you're​ a die-hard Amzon user, then you must buy this product and welcome Alexa into your home! In these past 6 months, Alexa's voice recognition has greatly improved! Using machine learning allows Alexa to improve her voice recognition skills daily. The more people talk to Alexa, the more she learns and improves.    If you are a Prime member and/or a Amazon Unlimited member, you can ask her to play almost any song you can think of! If you want to hear a certain album, then ask her. Or if you want a radio station, the music will not end! Or if you want a certain genre of music, just ask!    Alexa becomes a part of the family. If you want the news read, she will. If you're​ celebrating a birthday, ask Alexa to sing &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; and she will happily; it's beautiful too! From playing music, to singing, to answering questions and playing games, Alexa will fit into your home! If you start off with one dot, you'll probably be buying more later on. One tip to improve voice recognition is to go-to the settings in the Alexa app, and do a voice training on each Echo you have. This greatly enhanced my experience. I have heard Amazon is working on a feature that will give Alexa the ability to recognize the voice that is speaking. That means no more switching profiles, as she knows it's you. This will also allow her to filter out other people taking, so you will no longer have to ask people to quiet down before taking to her! ",
"Sid Scheck","March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"&nbsp;It was about 2 weeks ago when I was talking with my friend about their Echo Dot and she showed me a few things. I thought very cool and maybe I should get one. Sure enough, 2 days later I won one at a company event. The Echo Dot is generally easy to set up. Be sure to have the Amazon Alexa  App downloaded when you are going to set up the Echo Dot. As I used it to ask questions, it has amazed me. I don't show it in the video, but I asked Alexa to put an item it my shopping cart and sure enough, there in my shopping cart was the item. I can see I will be using the Alex to listen to different types of music as well. So much you can do with it. Have fun! You will love it! ",
"H. Salsano","March 12, 2017 ",5.0,"This was our first Echo Dot, and we love her.  Although, not sure she always loves us, as sometimes she doesn't even answer us.  She seems to have a hearing deficiency.  We do have to speak loud and clear for her to even hear us, and especially if we want her to actually understand us.  The problem is mostly when she is playing music or the TV is on.  Of course, she can hear everyone on the TV just fine and respond to all the Alexa commercials.  Good think I have the purchasing PIN set up so only I can order things!  I like listening to the news feeds from Cnet, NPR and the weather.  I like controlling the TV, AV system and lights through her.  I add items to the Our Groceries android app through her, and she usually gets it right.  I use the timer and alarm functions often, especially when my 2 other kitchen timers are already running for other things.  I can tell her to &#34;Turn on Amazon Music&#34; which turns on the stereo and selects Aux, turns on the Amazon Basics Bluetooth receiver, and then I tell her what to play and it comes through the stereo.  I can even listen to kindle books and such this way for more volume.  Love the pause and resume, in case the phone rings.  For music, I tell her to Skip this song when something awful come on .  As time goes on, I find more useful things.  I am now looking at a new skill to alert friends if there is an emergency, called Ask My Buddy, which sounds useful for when one of us is home alone and something happens. ",
NurseMeg,"March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I originally bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts and didn't buy one for myself.  BIG MISTAKE!  I gave the first one to my father-in-law and I liked it so much that I opened one of the other presents and kept it to use with my home automation. Don't worry, it wasn't easy around Christmas time, but I did get one of these to replace the one I lifted from the expected receiver.  I then decided to get another one as a gift for my father.  I gave each of my fathers a wemo accessory to get them started in the home automation. I put mine in the kitchen to make use of the grocery list, play music while cooking dinner, and get weather/traffic while I am getting things ready to head out the door for work.  We used this a lot around Christmas time to play Christmas music. I synced this with 2 Nest thermostats and 3 Wemo light switches on exterior lighting of my house.  I can tell Alexa to turn on/off my outside lights and they all turn on/off or I can individually turn them on/off by their location (turn on/off front porch light).  I can tell Alexa to adjust the temperature of my downstairs, upstairs, or both thermostats to a given temperature. It would be nice to ask Alexa what the temperature of the upstairs/downstairs is and receive a temperature read back.  All in all I am enjoying it for my needs and recommend it! I believe it will only get better with time and addition of new devices.    I did have one odd thing happen with the Echo Dot recently.  This past week a song randomly started playing. I didn't say &#34;alexa&#34; or ask for anything to be played and it started playing when no one was in our kitchen area. Does have me worried a bit and wondering how it started playing the music. ",
Adrian,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This is a slightly useful device. It's ok for asking web search info items , like weather or scores, and a few other things.  I had a lot of problems connecting to it initially, becuase I use 2-factor authentication on my account and by the time I had gone to my authenticator app and got a code, returned to Alexa app and gone through the login process again, the code expired. I had to turn off 2-factor on my account, and even then it made me do a capcha that was complicated by the fact that the app won't scroll, so I was typing in the capcha field blind. Thanks for the frustration, Alexa. I have secure physical possession of both devices, why can't the process be much easier?  I have a Harmony hub for AV control, and Alexa can use it. Once again, connection problems abound, as the Alexa app insisted that I didn't have a Harmony hub, even though the Harmony app is on the very same phone that Alexa app is on. Eventually I was successful. Then came the sad discovery that all it can do is turn AV gear on and off. There went my dream of tuning my dvr by voice command. More frustration.  So then I linked my Spotify account to have it play thru bluetooth speakers. This works, but every time I return to play music again, I have to manually make spotify use the bluetooth speakers, as it defaults to using the Dot speaker. Haven't found a work-around yet. Thanks for nothing, Alexa.  As far as simple voice commands, it works about 80% of the time. Sometimes it ignores me, sometimes it whines about the internet connection. I live in a rural neighborhood that's not too badly wifi congested. My cell phone stays connected anywhere on my property but Alexa struggles from a 30 foot distance to my wifi router. It randomly announces when it connects to the wifi or bluetooth. It reacts to what it hears on TV sometimes(yes I have done the voice training), which leads to baffling announcements. I say 'Alexa, shut up&#34; a lot.  In summary, this would be a good deal at $19. Too bad it cost $50.  I'll keep it, but it doesn't really do anything my Nexus 6 won't do with the &#34;OK Google&#34; function. Amazon is a major cloud provider, why can't they put a good web app up for connecting and configuring and linking?  I can't recommend this device unless you are a 'smart home' hobbyist who wants to spend money linking it to Zwave or Zigbee devices.  UPDATE: I decided to keep this and use it as a voice commanded search engine for simple questions, but its results have been poor. I will be returning it as being nearly useless to me.  When it failed to answer a question, I repeated the question to Ok Google on my phone, and in all cases it was able to answer. Here are some of those questions:  1. When was the piano invented?  2. Who was Field Marshal von Rundstedt?  3. What is maximum allowed length of a golf club?  I'm not interested in using this as am Amazon shopping tool, which it is probably good at. I'm sending it back. ",
Tina,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I am totally in love with my echo dot!!  Alexa is awesome, and she will even thank you if you tell her. ;)  I know there could be improvements, and I'm sure she will just keep improving, but she is still well worth every dime now. She not only tells the time and weather, etc but I can just tell her what to put in my shopping list both with an app and without.  She reads to me, even just regular kindle books, and if it's possible to overuse the timer then I am sure to find out lol because I use it all the time.  She is loud too.  I thought I'd need a speaker for it but we can hear her just fine from all of our rooms.  Granted we only have 1 level, but we were still very impressed with her volume, and it's not even all the way up. We keep it on 7 or 8 and she's pretty loud. Highly recommend. ",
"Dianna Dougherty","January 27, 2017 ",2.0,"Received as a gift so can't complain much. It is JUST OK. There are def some bugs and its not very intuitive.  You can only ask it tings that it knows such as to play music or what the weather is. Everything has to be preset in the app. Nothing is automatically learned.  With google you can ask ANYTHING and it will read you the Wikipedia answer.  Not with alexa. Her knowledge is quite minimal.  One major flaw that i found and reported to amazon is this:  If you use a bose Bluetooth speaker with it and are playing a music and tell alexa to stop it will stop the music.  Okay there. Now you can walk away or leave your house and if your speaker has an automatic shut off as soon as the wireless speaker turns off it will begin playing the last song it stopped on trough its internal speaker so i have to tell it to stop again. Why would this be useful?? If i tell alexa to stop playing music and then power off the wireless speaker it starts playing again from built in audio. Immagine waking up in the middle of the night to music playing. Not fun. Needs to be as SMART as google and honestly not sure amazon will ever have that capability. But for 50bucks I guess you get what you pay for. ",
CM,"November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"This is such an awesome product! I saw the full-sized echo at a friend's house and was thoroughly impressed. I got the echo dot (I'm on a student budget) and hooked it up to a nice set of speakers in my apartment and I love the potential this thing has. It's not 100% there yet as far as the software but it is being updated on the regular, so its like buying a piece of technology that keeps getting better. I even bought one for my parents (who have a lot of smart devices in the house, but no central way to control them) as a gift. It works with most of the smart products u probably already have in your home including the nest thermostat/CO monitor etc. NOTICE: the 3.5 mm jack takes a bit more force than normal to &#34;click&#34; in when inserting an audio cable - your product is NOT defective lol. ",
"Roland W.","January 4, 2017 ",2.0,"&nbsp;Ok, the idea of not having to type your questions and getting pretty good and accurate answers (most of the time) is pretty amazing.  Set up was very easy, just download the Alexa App and then follow the step by step WIFI set up instructions. Right now I am only using it for basic requests (see video) and that works well. I will keep adding skills (these are additional little programs you can enable on the amazon.com website Just search &#34;Alexa Skills&#34; in the amazon search bar and it routes you to the menu. You can add sports teams, kids games etc. Alexa can tell you jokes (most of them are pretty funny and all so far are kid friendly).  Speaker quality is ok for such a small device - you can plug in an external speaker directly into the Dot and then you can control it through the Dot. I have a Sonos System (whole house), and I would have to get a separate DOT to plug into the sonos in my media centre, so the Dots can communicate. Have not done that so far. But it is a lot of fun to play around, get weather, movie times, play some background music or meditation songs etc. Just play around with it. I have a &#34;slight&#34; accent and it understands me without a problem.  Just be prepared that kids will yell at this little thing, demanding answers and a play buddy who gives them honest feedback on how their hair looks today :)    Currently I am using it mostly as a toy, but as my house is already rather high tech with everything wireless from thermostate (Lennox, which does not connect to ALEXA yet - per customer service) to security camera, Hue lights in some areas, I am planning on expanding the in house Dot Network over the coming months when manufacturers add more functionalities. I keep you posted.    I went on Amazon Skill website and enabled a ton of skills. Just make sure you write down how to activate them. (play 20 words, the secret door, bed time story etc.... you can have a lot of fun with these. I will get one for my daughters room so she can get &#34;Alexa, play relaxing songs for 15 minutes&#34; at bed time.

Hopels,"December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Replaced the larger Alexa Echo with the Dot 2nd Gen.  Obviously the much smaller size is nice.  I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.    The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.    We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.    Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.  I took off one star because while I have no issues with it, it sometimes doesn't &#34;hear&#34; my wife. ",
Rebecca,"January 19, 2017 ",5.0,"This little guy is fantastic! While I doubt anyone will be using the sheer wealth of functions this can perform (as some are, admitedly, quite lack-luster), the ones that I use it for are done well. Once the shiny veneer of new tech fades off, and you eventually stop asking Echo for jokes and punchlines, you won't be discarding her - which is common with other new innovations. Instead, you will probably use one of the following functions regularly, each of which I recommend getting the echo dot for:    -Setting kitchen timers: You won't think much of it until you try it, then you won't be able to go back. Just saying &#34;Alexa, start a timer for 20 minutes&#34; without jumbling for your phone, while simultaneously closing the oven is revolutionary. This is one of the best features Alexa has.    -Interactive Speaker Assistant: While I doubt audiophiles will be satisfied with Alexa's sound quality, that problem can easily be remedied, since you can just connect your own speakers through the audio jack, and Alexa will speak through them. The sound quality on the Echo Dot's speakers isn't bad, though, if you choose to listen through the dot. Either way, Alexa can search music from Spotify, Amazon Music, and Pandora via vocal commands. You can also set Spotify as your main music streamer (Amazon Music is the default, of course), so you won't have to verbally command Alexa to use Spotify, if that is your choice. It's great to just say a song, and have Alexa play it. ",
JMDK,"October 29, 2016 ",4.0,"The Good:    The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of &#34;Alexa&#34;, &#34;Amazon&#34; or &#34;Echo&#34;).    The Bad:    The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.    Overall:    We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature. ",
"Just me","March 14, 2017 ",5.0,"I am a big amazon fan and I depend on reviews. Let me start by saying I was so excited about this product even though my spouse was saying it will only make me lazy..Lol. I know there are several reviews on this product but here goes...I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen basically for the 2- level of our home; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive bigger one and too good to pass up. The Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the 2 floor!  Day 1 when I received it I was a little worried that I would need to send it back because Alexas first word would not sound; for example I would ask &#34;Alexa what time is it?&#34; and she would say &#34;Is 7:30pm&#34; or I would ask &#34;Tell me a joke&#34; and she would not say the first part of the joke, I asked &#34;how old are you?&#34; and the whole human part would not sound. FYI: you can read the answers on your app as well, that's how I knew I missed that part. The next day I came home and some kind of way she was answering all of the questions. I don't know if she just needed to be full charged or what, but the problem fixed itself.  I am really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. Considering everything, for $49 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to building your smart home, home automation and voice recognition technology. Overall, I would highly recommend this product. ",
SundayAtDusk,"December 30, 2016 ",5.0,"This was a Christmas present for my elder mother. We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device. ",
"The Bon","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"We had an Echo and thought it was all we needed. We put it in our livingroom (by the kitchen) and I pick random songs to play during the day, but also ask questions whenever I'm watching a movie on TV or listening to a song and wonder if a star or singer is still alive (ask Alexa - Which is the Echo's name).  I put things on my 'shopping list and it goes on my phone automatically (and on my husband's phone too, since we both have the Alexa app on our phones.). Recipes, measurements, and facts about whatever. But it's nowhere near our bedroom, so I ordered an Echo Dot as an 'extension'.  I can't believe we lived without this little, inexpensive, companion. It's on my nightstand and acts as our alarm clock, news station, weather station, and music source that has EVERY KIND OF MUSIC you could possibly want, just for the asking.  We are so blessed to be living in a time where we can have these Amazon innovations at our fingertips. The Echo and Alexa both have replaced our clocks, encyclopedia, dictionary, stereo, cd's, etc. we ordered ours through the &#34;LOVE MY ECHO&#34; website where we also get all information on both. Thank you, Amazon, for a website like this one. ",

"Colleen M Traeger","April 6, 2017 ",5.0,"Impressed. At first I really enjoyed the Echo Dot. It was fun asking it questions. Then the novelty wore off. In order to have your questions answered you first DL an app then ask it to open something. The apps are strange lengthy names that are hard to remember like &#34;Alexia, open &#34;My  Horoscope to read my daily horoscope&#34; instead of a simple 'what's my horoscope&#34;. There are 10k apps full of interesting and useless things. Why it can't be developed where you DL an app to customize your needs is beyond me.    What's interesting is that you can make your home a smart home and control it remotely or just by speaking what you need.    I've also loved asking it to add things to my to do list as well as add things to my shopping list.    While I do like it, I'm just a little disappointed. I'm hoping that this is similar to when Dot Matrix first came out.    I can without a doubt see the value in this maturing. I'll hang on to it (in 30 years it'll be worth a nice bundle). Regardless of the slight pessimistic review, I do recommend it. ",
"Sassy and Oliver","January 28, 2017 ",5.0,"I have both the Echo, and the Echo Dot. This little Dot works as well as its big sister Echo, only.... the 🔊 speaker is a wimp. However, if you are looking to save a lot on the price difference between the two, this one is the perfect compromise. Just expect poor sound quality. I think you can connect the Dot to better speakers, I just have not learned how. I use the Dot in my bedroom, and the big Echo in my living room. The big Echo has fantastic speakers and I don't need to turn the volume up very high.  Buy this Dot to save money, or buy the Echo for great speakers...both work the same. ",
Dia,"March 6, 2017 ",4.0,"Alexa is a lot of fun. I have added some of her skills but they don't seem to function as expected. She only speaks English, which while I can understand programming another language could've been a huge investment, it's still a disadvantage.    My favorite features are:  `playing music via a paired speaker. That sounds silly, but it's so convenient to just yell &#34;Alexa, play iheart radio&#34; when busy.  `timers. Asking her to set a timer is really convenient  `shopping list. She can add items to your shopping list which you can view on your smartphone when out of the house. For this forget-everything-gal, that feature is really helpful.  `controlling it with the app. My husband still doesn't know how I can turn down the music from the other room - or turn it on. I'll keep it a mystery for as long as I can. It's nice to be able to shut off a timer or change the volume from my phone when I'm on the other side of the house. ",
Jarren,"March 11, 2017 ",4.0,"This is a great item, especially as a developer. My baby cousins also enjoyed this product so much, I bought them one for Christmas. You can ask Alexa for holiday jokes. You can also say, &#34;Alexa, tell me I'm beautiful&#34;.    I use it for an alarm clock, to play music on Spotify, and to hear daily facts. You can also get some exclusive Alexa only deals. As a developer, you can get free hoodies / shirts from developing Alexa Skills and submitting it to the app store.    Beware though, you might get noise complaints from your upstairs neighbor from having this device. I guess this device playing a few songs at volume 7 (out of max 10) playing music at 7 pm can net you a noise complaint. I didn't even know the speakers were that great, but apparently so! :grimacing: ",
"Sid Scheck","March 12, 2017 ",4.0,"&nbsp;It was about 2 weeks ago when I was talking with my friend about their Echo Dot and she showed me a few things. I thought very cool and maybe I should get one. Sure enough, 2 days later I won one at a company event. The Echo Dot is generally easy to set up. Be sure to have the Amazon Alexa  App downloaded when you are going to set up the Echo Dot. As I used it to ask questions, it has amazed me. I don't show it in the video, but I asked Alexa to put an item it my shopping cart and sure enough, there in my shopping cart was the item. I can see I will be using the Alex to listen to different types of music as well. So much you can do with it. Have fun! You will love it! ",
"Amazon Customer","March 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I love the size and the price but the speaker is horrible. I have seen better speakers in smaller things so it's not like it can't be done. I can say that the microphone is really well-made it can pick my voice up 20 feet away in the Next Room  at  moderate levels  without having to yell. Like the Alexa, I wish it was more informative, there are so many questions I asked that Alexa does not know the answer to but Google does. I also wish that a lot of the apps were not third party where you have to ask Alexa to ask the app to do something like my buddy you have to say Alexa ask my buddy to send an alert message to a family member because I have fallen and can't get up it would be nice if you could say Alexa contact my family member and tell them I have fallen and cannot get up. But aside from that I love the direction that it's heading, I just wish it was there already we have the technology to make it happen I can only assume there's red tape involved ",
"Amazon Customer","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I thoughtful Echo was interesting, but wanted to opt with just the Dot and use my own Bluetooth speakers. Unfortunately, Amazon discontinued the first generation just as I was able to order.  When the second generation was announced, I knew I'd get one.  With the $10/ month for 5 month plan for Prime members, it was a no trainer. Although I'm more heavily into Apple's ecosystem, and gave smart appliances (Apple)  they will work with Alexander too.  There is quite a bit of crossover. I'm excited and look forward even using the Dot as an alarm clock, awakening me with my Prime Music. I'm sure it's going to be loads of other fun too. I also have a Kindle Fire HDX, FireStick, etc, and know it will integrate nicely.    I have had it for about a week and it's VERY cool!  Does so much more than even Siri by being able to add skills. Also works great with my iDevices switched simulataneously with iOS HomeKit. This was a great buy! ",
Stephanie,"November 14, 2016 ",3.0,"I like this Alexia dot thingy! Sometimes though she talks to me when I am not talking to her. She thinks she hears her name. She seems kinda needy. She's always there. Listening to my conversations and trying to include herself in them. I have to tell her that I wasn't talking to her and to only talk when she's been spoken to. She doesn't get the hint. Also when she hears her name on the Alexia commercials she responds. Overall I really like this contraption. It's pretty neat. It tells me anything I want to know. She even sang me the alphabet like William Shatner one day. She hasn't done it since. We liked her so much we got another one for upstairs. Alexia even controls our lights. Our house is basically automated. ",
"this is me","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Absolutely love these. We bought the tall Echo. Got on the list before it came out. Then we bought a dot for our shop, Then we went back and bought the deal that was buy 5 get 1 free. These are amazing. We have one for almost every room. Although, I do not advise that. Reason being is that when you say &#34;Alexa, what is the forecast&#34; and loud enough, &#34;all&#34; of them start giving you the forecast...lol So, we keep them spread out. We also gave a couple to our adult kids for Christmas.    Great for helping to figure out math problems, telling jokes and you can even order amazon items from your echo. There is so much the echo dot can do. They are a must have.    PROS:  the clarity is very good.  the compact size is perfect  you can ask almost anything and he will have the answer    CONS:  my only con is that they sometimes wake up without us even talking.    But, these are highly recommended for sure. ",
LTCJDC,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"After three months of use, I don't like the Echo Dot or Alexa's attitude. It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't allow you to return an item after 30 days. I'd be returning it if they did. Common language isn't as successful as when verbally searching Google. Alexa can't find things without exact phrasing. I argue with her everyday because she doesn't understand me, doesn't have the answer or would like to sign me up for some Amazon product or service. She apologizes a lot. It is very frustrating and forces you to use the Alexa App to find what you need. The App is pretty good to find and control what you want the Dot to do.  Alexa can't always find things on iHeart radio or Tunein even though you listened to it 10 minutes before. She will sign you up for Amazon Music in a heartbeat. She does understand what &#34;worthless&#34; means and it quick to take offense. The Skills aren't very helpful and are mostly silly snippets that seem to have been written by young kids. Buy Google Home instead. You won't regret it. ",
"R. Seehoffer","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Well, I ordered 2 of these a few weeks ago and they arrived today. Both are now set up and functioning using the Alexa app. Very cool, I must say. I added several skills, including TP-Link's Kasa to control several devices around the house, and a few others that seemed interesting--all are working well. I've gone through and played with most of the abilities, linked up my Google Calendar, and went through the voice training. I've had a little trouble with the Alexa app freezing up, and some stutter on a few radio stations playing through Tunein, perhaps due to high bit rates. Speaker quality was better than I expected, and mic pickup from various locations seems fine. They're a pretty nice addition to a connected home, at a fairly smoking price.    Update: As time goes by, this thing just gets better. I have it playing music in the background all day via TuneIn, controlling a number of TP-Link switches and lights throughout the house, and giving me relevant news/information as needed. There are some very cool installable skills available, although I noticed that many of these skills are redundant as Alexa already does them natively. These include telling me a joke (as for knock/knock, physics, science, Star Trek or Star Wars, Christmas, etc), flipping a coin, picking a random number between x and y, or rolling dice, weather for one day or many, Wikipedia info, etc. I am just now getting into IFTTT and see several possibilities there. I've had no hiccups at all getting Alexa to hear me across the house, and triggering the correct unit based on my proximity. Smart home control has also worked perfectly. I've got one unit on my nightstand, and one in the living room. Alexa is also very polite. Wish it 'goodnight' or say 'thankyou'--the responses are not what you'd expect. Like I said in the title--a lot of fun. ",
ChuckG,"April 10, 2017 ",2.0,"I bought two of these Echo Dots because I already had some great bluetooth speakers, and did not need to purchase the larger Echo. I intend to stream music, and begin moving our home towards home automation.    Set up was simple via the IOS Alexa app, and I was off and running with Alexa streaming music from Pandora and Amazon Prime Music.    The App also detected my Honeywell thermostat, so Alexa can override and cool my house on demand beyond my already programmed thermostat schedule.    Last night, I purchased a Logitech Harmony Hub, and now my Living Room TV, Roku, Media Player and Home Theater system now work via voice!    My next step will be integrating some Phillips lights and hub into the system.    While for some there may be a learning curve to add connected devices, there are lots of resources online, and many YouTube videos too.    The only thing, Alexa cannot clean the house or make dinner yet! (g) ",
"Amazon Customer","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Being a previous X10 user, was looking for a better and more up to date way of controlling my lights and other devices.  Amazon Echo provided this control point at a price point that made it economical to place devices in multiple rooms.  I coupled it with the Samsung SmartThings hub and control devices from GE, Cree and GoControl as well as my Harmony device used to control my Entertainment center.  Alexa was able to recognize and control the lighting devices but for the Harmony devices you need to ask Alexa to ask Harrmony to perform an action and this appears to be the case for a lot of other add-ons where you need to remember the service name to issue a command.  My biggest disappointment was that Alexa is 100% reliant on its Internet connection and connection to the Amazon servers.  If your Internet connection is down, or the servers are down then Alexa is about as useful as lead boots at a swimming competition.  In the 4 weeks since I deployed, my Internet has been down once and the Amazon servers unresponsive making Alexa useless to control my devices or even set a wake up alarm.  Would be nice if a set of base commands were installed on the device that allowed it to function with locally connected devices without having to talk to the Mother Ship first. ",
"Michael G. Fisher","January 7, 2017 ",5.0,"While we are still trying to figure out all it can do and how best to ask it what we want, we are amused by it and sometimes frustrated by it.  The reason I gave it 5 stars is because of an unexpected benefit.  Our oldest daughter has a pretty challenging speech impediment and using Alexa has forced her to slow down and enunciate clearly.  Not only is Alexa learning how to understand my daughter, my daughter is also slowing down and learning to communicate with Alexa.  The huge benefit is she is now slowing down to communicate more clearly with us.  This is something her speech therapists have been working on with her for years.  Alexa has gotten these results from her in a few months.  The Echo Dot is a useful tool and will only become more useful as its capabilities grow.  Thank you, Amazon. ",
Mooj,"March 17, 2017 ",3.0,"Love this. Makes life just a little easier. When I wake up, I can have Alexa give me the weather and any reminders for the day. If I get the urge to listen to a particular song, album or artist, all I have to do is ask (this is particularly useful while playing video games or packing for my move). Pretty much anything I want to know, I just ask. She even plays games (you got nothing on me when it comes to Simpsons trivia, Alexa!). Why can't life always be this easy?    Definitely considering buying another one for the other room in the new apartment. And I definitely recommend to anyone.    One suggestion to anyone buying, however. Make sure you have a good speaker to attach it to because the sound isn't great out of the dot itself (which is understandable given its size and cost). I use a TDK A33 Bluetooth portable speaker, which gets great sound for a little portable speaker and works flawlessly with the dot. ",
"Peter E.","March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"I love this!!!  When these first came out I didn't think it would be something I would use much.  At least, not until my whole house has smart appliances.    My wife didn't want me to buy it she couldn't see the use for it.    She became addicted to it the first night. Especially if you sign up for Amazon Prime Music which has a huge selection for about $4 a month.    We've been watching less TV and listening to more music which is wonderful.    I love using the shopping list and to do list feature.    My 2.5 year old loves it and already talks to Alexa. We play kids song mixes they have and he dances away.    The weather and time, calculations and conversions and Wikipedia are really helpful to have around.    It's loud enough for a living room but I do want the full sized one eventually and move this to a bedroom.    The voice recognition is amazingly good too. You don't have to pause for a moment after saying Alexa. Just speak as you would to anyone home. It's really impressive.    You also don't notice it's even there, the design is so good.    I can go on and on so let's just say I didn't think I would use it much but heard rave reviews from friends and love having it!!! ",
"Eric Smith","February 11, 2017 ",5.0,"OK, maybe Alexa deserves a better rating given she does what she is advertised to do. But after having her in the house for a month, I found the Echo Dot was only being used for novelty purposes or responding to false positives. At the price point, it seemed like a good opportunity to try out a home assistant, but it wasn't something we used on a daily basis. In hindsight, it seems pointless to use in conjunction with a smart phone. I have a Nexus with Google Assistant which does everything the Echo was doing for me and usually does it better. Plus the phone is almost always with me rather than isolated in one room of the house. &#34;OK Google...&#34; works with my IoT switches and outlets, news briefings, weather updates, online information and adding items to my shopping list. Aside from novelty, I see no point is buying into another eco-system unless you really like instant ordering from Amazon. ",
"Avatars VR Arcade","January 22, 2017 ",5.0,"This product is amazing and clever. It works great for when you want to just listen to some music or hear the news etc. without fiddling with any devices. Especially when your busy doing other activities like cooking. It also has some very funny and smart programming. You will get some very funny responses depending on what you ask it. Also the microphones are excellent and can understand you easily even when the music is playing. My kids love asking it to tell a joke. I love asking it factual information that I have questions about and want a quick answer. I have it connected by Bluetooth to my TVs soundbar. It's great, buy it now. How many products can make you and your family smarter?    Only thing I would improve is adding an audible tone to the ring that lights up when it is ready for a response so if you are not looking at it, you would still know that it heard you call it's name and is ready for a command or question.

Matthew,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have anot echo and a dot. I love them both. The speaker on this is better than advertised, I believe. It's not bad for music but is obviously not as good as the full echo. Alexa is wonderful and the features are very useful.

"Just me","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I am a big amazon fan and I depend on reviews. Let me start by saying I was so excited about this product even though my spouse was saying it will only make me lazy..Lol. I know there are several reviews on this product but here goes...I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen basically for the 2- level of our home; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive bigger one and too good to pass up. The Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the 2 floor!  Day 1 when I received it I was a little worried that I would need to send it back because Alexas first word would not sound; for example I would ask &#34;Alexa what time is it?&#34; and she would say &#34;Is 7:30pm&#34; or I would ask &#34;Tell me a joke&#34; and she would not say the first part of the joke, I asked &#34;how old are you?&#34; and the whole human part would not sound. FYI: you can read the answers on your app as well, that's how I knew I missed that part. The next day I came home and some kind of way she was answering all of the questions. I don't know if she just needed to be full charged or what, but the problem fixed itself.  I am really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. Considering everything, for $49 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to building your smart home, home automation and voice recognition technology. Overall, I would highly recommend this product. ",
"Diane J Owen","November 27, 2016 ",5.0,"Alexa goes in spurts in my house. She's probably lonely, cause I like quiet and I forget about her. But, she's really good at playing music--I hooked her up to my speakers. She's fun to play games with. Amazon sends ideas all the time, like ordering special deals, or music playlist. They enable new skills, like apps, all the time. I like Magic 8 Ball. Ask her if Trump will last four years. Anyway, well worth her small investment. ",

I got the [[ASIN:B013GBRR32 Philips BT6000R/37 Splash-Proof Wireless Portable Speaker (Red)&nbsp;from Amazon and the Dot sounds much better and the speaker is splash proof which a more durable choice for a kid.

When she plays music, she will tell me the title and artist when I ask. I understand that I can add a speaker to the Dot but I think the sound is great just the way it is. Very good quality! It has volume setting from one to ten. Just ask her to set the number you prefer. Everything is done with your voice. She even turns my bedroom light on and off when I ask.

Adrian,"January 10, 2017 ",2.0,"This is a slightly useful device. It's ok for asking web search info items , like weather or scores, and a few other things.  I had a lot of problems connecting to it initially, becuase I use 2-factor authentication on my account and by the time I had gone to my authenticator app and got a code, returned to Alexa app and gone through the login process again, the code expired. I had to turn off 2-factor on my account, and even then it made me do a capcha that was complicated by the fact that the app won't scroll, so I was typing in the capcha field blind. Thanks for the frustration, Alexa. I have secure physical possession of both devices, why can't the process be much easier?  I have a Harmony hub for AV control, and Alexa can use it. Once again, connection problems abound, as the Alexa app insisted that I didn't have a Harmony hub, even though the Harmony app is on the very same phone that Alexa app is on. Eventually I was successful. Then came the sad discovery that all it can do is turn AV gear on and off. There went my dream of tuning my dvr by voice command. More frustration.  So then I linked my Spotify account to have it play thru bluetooth speakers. This works, but every time I return to play music again, I have to manually make spotify use the bluetooth speakers, as it defaults to using the Dot speaker. Haven't found a work-around yet. Thanks for nothing, Alexa.  As far as simple voice commands, it works about 80% of the time. Sometimes it ignores me, sometimes it whines about the internet connection. I live in a rural neighborhood that's not too badly wifi congested. My cell phone stays connected anywhere on my property but Alexa struggles from a 30 foot distance to my wifi router. It randomly announces when it connects to the wifi or bluetooth. It reacts to what it hears on TV sometimes(yes I have done the voice training), which leads to baffling announcements. I say 'Alexa, shut up&#34; a lot.  In summary, this would be a good deal at $19. Too bad it cost $50.  I'll keep it, but it doesn't really do anything my Nexus 6 won't do with the &#34;OK Google&#34; function. Amazon is a major cloud provider, why can't they put a good web app up for connecting and configuring and linking?  I can't recommend this device unless you are a 'smart home' hobbyist who wants to spend money linking it to Zwave or Zigbee devices.  UPDATE: I decided to keep this and use it as a voice commanded search engine for simple questions, but its results have been poor. I will be returning it as being nearly useless to me.  When it failed to answer a question, I repeated the question to Ok Google on my phone, and in all cases it was able to answer. Here are some of those questions:  1. When was the piano invented?  2. Who was Field Marshal von Rundstedt?  3. What is maximum allowed length of a golf club?  I'm not interested in using this as am Amazon shopping tool, which it is probably good at. I'm sending it back. ",

And of course the Audible for only $14.99 a month, and you have a free trial for a month and two free books of your choice!(after free trial it is going to cost $14.99 per month but you get a free credit for any book!)    And then Music! You can add up to 250 songs to the amazon music cloud and hear it anywhere with your echo dot. FOR FREE! It can be any songs you bought digital from any source, google, itunes you name it. And if you have reach the limit for 250 songs, you can just pay as little as $7.99 a month for ulimate and Amazon Music is free to listen too!    And yeah you can ask question that you want to know the answer, from a country, a person, an animal, a place, or any facts etc. And Alexa is just so smart to answer everything and Alexa is learning day to day with new skills.

I wanted to start getting into &#34;Smart Home&#34; technology and although I can use Siri on my iphone to do the same thing the Echo dot does sometimes my phone is in my pocket so I am not able to communicate with Siri, that's where the Elixa and the Echo Dot comes in handy. I have not seen hardly any negative reviews on YouTube for the Echo line and the Echo Dot is an inexpensive way to get into this new personal assistant space. The Echo Dot does have a speaker that will allow you to communicate with Elixa but if you intend on listening to music you will want to connect a external speaker via aux. cable or bluetooth which is very easy to connect using the Elixa app. After using the Echo Dot for about a week now I have been very impressed with it's voice recognition skills as they are extremely reliable and very well implemented.    With Elixa you can get the weather forecast,  listen to music of any kind, ( $3 a mo. prime music membership required) control almost anything in your home with the proper components (sold separately) and so far I just use Elixa to turn on and off my bedroom lights by just speaking which is so cool.    I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get into the personal assistant technology, you will not be disappointed. ",
"David Merritt","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Turns out the 90-day warranty matters.  Bought mine in Nov '16, now in Mar '17, the bluetooth connectivity is no longer working.  It'll say it's connected, and it'll play audio from a speaker, but the audio cuts in and out about every second--it's NOT playing much more than it IS playing.  I confirmed it was the Echo Dot device because I moved the Dot right next to the speaker, and I also tried it with another bluetooth speaker in another room.  Both situations led to the same problem--horribly intermittent bluetooth connectivity.  My phone could connect and play audio with no problems for both speakers.  There were no changes in our home in terms of RF-emitting devices--the Dot just stopped working one day.  Looks like I'll have to connect with the audio cable permanently.  Other than that failure, I've loved having it! ",
"K Durden","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I LOVE my new Echo Dot!  Im giving a 4 star rating because Ive only had it for a week or so and im still learning what i can do with it. plus I did have to send in one comment when it could not define a word and Id already read in earlier comments that it should be sble to define this particular word.  However, I was pleased that I received a prompt response acknowledging that the Dot was giving an improper response.  other than that, its just been a matter of learning how to phrase a request. 99% of the time Alexa gets it right.  The other 1%?  I find you need to phrase the rewuest correctly and without hesitation. Alexa doesnt wait for you to think about it. She is ready to work!!!  I will definitely be getting more Dots for other rooms in my home!  Bravo, Amazon! ",
W,"March 14, 2017 ",2.0,"This baby Echo is still learning to walk. I have the big Echo and love it. Sadly, the Echo Dot I bought only worked half of the time. Even sadder, when I sent it to Amazon for repair, they returned a completely broken Echo Dot back. Double whammy.    Commenting on the product when it DID work, it was okay at best. &#34;Alexa&#34; functions are great (as with the big Echo), but the build quality is below my expectations; it looks, feels, and sounds like a cheap, light piece of plastic to me. The kind of object that shifts every time I bump into the charging cable (even lightly). The good news is the price and size. Might give it another try a generation or two later. ",
Kate,"March 25, 2017 ",4.0,"I'm not a techie and wouldn't have looked into Alexa or smart home stuff on my own.  But I was given one, and that's when life changed 😆  Okay exaggerated, but very cool. I set out to learn what all she can do. The lights were the first thing that struck me. I've changed to smart lights throughout the house. I don't need every light controlled since I'm not so lazy I can't go flip a switch, but I did realize how much this would help with the minimum evening lights, particularly the outside lights. It's very dark on my part of the street and I hate coming home without all three front lights on and I hate for my husband and teens to do the same. Also handy when the kids used to leave an upstairs light on over night. Now I can be sure all Lights are off.   Easy access music, weather, traffic, and alarms/timers are great.  I've only had it a few weeks and I'm sure I'll discover all sorts of new stuff she can do. All set up and programming has been super easy and smooth. I also bought a SmartThings hub to control a variety of lightbulb brands and plugs.  I'm ready to order a couple more!  It's a great affordable way to modernize life for average people. Very glad I was given an echo dot. ",
Val_NYC,"February 3, 2017 ",2.0,"Good: This is the product we've been waiting for. All the internet knowledge at the tip of your fingers... just say &#34;Alexa!&#34;, she'll be there for you answering to an enormous amount of questions. Ordering stuff online, giving you the traffic info on your way to work or just the forecast, keeping your life organized.   Of course, it's hard to resist from purchasing additional components...it's so cool to be able to lay on the sofa, turn the lights on or off, operate any IR devices you might have, locking doors, closing the blinds, starting the coffee maker or controlling the temperature using your voice. It doesn't matter the light switch is next to your head or the stereo/ TV remote is right in your hand. It's the feeling that you step into a new world with huge further options to discover, it's the power to having such a powerful tool at your disposal.  And I know the developers are just warming up.  Bad: Without WI-FI all home gadgets are useless. ",
"Christopher Cummins","November 26, 2016 ",5.0,"Died in about 6 months. I called customer service, and they said it is out of the 90 day warranty, but they will give me a discount on a new one. why would I want a new one if it only last 6 months, and they wont fix or replace it? I'm going to try the Google one. Beware if it breaks, they wont help you after 90 days. Good luck. ",
Twlb,"November 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I love these. We have four of them, and an Echo. But you don't need an Echo to use a Dot. The only big difference between the two is that the Echo has a much bigger speaker - but the Dot can be connected to any speaker you already own. Same &#34;brain&#34; in both.    If you're choosing between the Echo, Tap, and Dot, to me it's a no-brainer. They're not that different, but the Dot is way cheaper. The advantage of the Tap is that you can load songs on it, but it only has Echo/Dot's brain if it's connected to wi-fi.    We have Amazon Music Unlimited, and to use on several Dots, you need to buy the more expensive plan. Otherwise it only works on ONE - not one at a time, but one.    We use these for music, radio programs, audio books, timers, alarms, news, Hue lightbulbs, and misc questions, including some fun jokes. Hands-down the best technology device out there. ",
"Dee N","March 27, 2017 ",1.0,"We've been Echo users since the very beginning, so have experienced how rapidly Amazon has been improving the utility of this tool. We didn't expect to use it much, but now use it multiple times a day.    Compared to the full Echo, the Dot does 90% of the utility, but definitely falls flat when listening to music. It's okay to listen to NPR, but the internal speaker just doesn't do music justice. Of course, you can just add an external or Bluetooth speaker if you want to improve facility.    We use Echo daily to set timers and alarms, add things to our shopping and to-do lists, look up information (weather, measurements, etc.), listen to the radio, listen to music, etc. We're considering adding remote control of our lights so we'll have voice control of those as well. Not as advanced as Sarah (from Warehouse 13), but definitely a fun and useful tool! ",
Catrine,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"I have the amazon echo and wanted a second one for my home gym. I do mainly use it for the amazon music. It cost $3.99 per month with a huge selection of songs. When I got the Dot , I did not expect to pay more for the music. Unfortunately, I will be paying $7.99 per month for both. (that is with amazon prime) without Prime it would be $9.99 per month. The Dot does not have a great sound like the echo. If you are using it for music, I suggest getting a speaker. I do wish we could pick our own name. You have Echo, Alexa, or Amazon.  I use it mainly for the weather, find out what movies are playing, a wake up call, and music. It is fun to use. I am sure they will come out with an even better one in the future. For $50 you can't go wrong. Just wish I did not have to pay for Music. The whole family will enjoy it. ",
arizonahd,"December 8, 2016 ",5.0,"Instead of getting the larger Echo, I bought this to use with a pair of Bose speakers powered by cheap amplifier (also from Amazon). The result is a perfect sound system that cost me roughly $70, as the speakers were given to me. I must say, I am really impressed. The Alexa system works very well, we have no problems switching Pandora stations or asking her to play a particular song. It's a dream setup. For example, we had guests over and instead of playing one station, everyone asked Alexa what to play. Asking her the weather and news is cool but I lack all the cool gadgets that work with her. I haven't asked her to buy me anything yet, I figured I will do that when I am 600 lbs and bed bedridden from all this convenience. I'm starting to sweat from all these keystrokes, but I would definitely recommend this to the gadget lover and lazy person alike. ",
"Brian S","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Love it. As soon as these came out I bought one. I didn't need the nice speaker of the Echo, i just use it mostly for home automation. Ties into Samsung's Smartthings nicely.    What surprises me the most is that more often that not it understands my 3 year old son. This is both amazing and annoying as he loves to say (in a very muttled toddler voice), &#34;Alexa, turn off all the lights&#34;. To which Alexa will reply (80% of the time), &#34;OK&#34;. Every light in my house goes off... I'm not pointing this out as a negative, its quite remarkable she understands him correctly 80% of the time. The other 20% she can't understand him, but who can blame her, I can barley understand him sometimes.    We also love using this as a cooking timer, but even more so as countdown timer for bath time. It helps my son cope with playtime being over, he will even set her timer for me.    The Alexa platform is growing fast. Some things I hope to see soon:      -Text readouts and replies (for multiple people, e.g. &#34;Alexa send message to Brian from jessica's phone&#34;, even better perhaps someday she will distinguish 1 voice from another, using this as a security measure so only I can send messages from phone)    -Calendar Events    -API integration that will allow Alex to alert you to items (e.g. &#34;your front has been open for over 5 minutes&#34;, or &#34;Someone just rang your doorbell&#34;) ",
mikki629,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"My in-laws got me the Echo Dot for Christmas this year. I'll admit, I was skeptical about how much I would use it. I'm normally not a fan of voice activated ANYTHING. At first I liked that it could play music, but figured I wouldn't use it because I already have a pretty good radio/cd player. But now I can safely say that I LOVE my Echo Dot. The music recommendations for me are always spot on. The apps/skills I have on there are all great & I have not come across any that don't work. And there is the added bonus of the cheesy jokes it has. (I know not everyone likes those kind of jokes, but I'm a big fan of bad puns & silly jokes.) While I'm no expert, I would say that the speaker on the Echo Dot is great quality for the price you pay. There is of course the odd time where it doesn't respond to the wake word or doesn't understand something, but it's not often enough to be a problem or for me to give anything less than 5 stars. Overall, I'm VERY happy with my Echo Dot! ",
"Matthew Pence","February 27, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is a bit...special.  I can give the echo dot a command, the command will fail, then I can reissue the same command with the same inflection and no background noise...with success?    The search functionality is limited.  I can't ask a conversational question (&#34;Alexa, why can't I use you to search the internet&#34;).  However, it does function really well as a vocal clock. (&#34;Alexa, time&#34;)    No apparent ability to control colors or scenes on my Philips Hue system.  :-/    The connection to Prime music works well with my home theater.  Alexa is good at finding music that I ask for. ",
tonyb,"April 9, 2017 ",5.0,"This echo dot refuses to stay connected to Wi-Fi.  It initially connects without a problem. It works for short time, then it just stops.   I keep resetting it back to factory settings,  but it still does not connect.   I have had three echo's for quite a while and have never once had an issue with any of them.  This is the second dot have tried, and I have had the exact same issue with both of them. ",
Cari,"April 13, 2017 ",3.0,"I've had the larger Echo since they did the early pre-sale for Prime members years ago and love it. I got the Echo dot for my mother (late 50's but frustratingly bad with new technology) for Christmas this year. I wasn't sure if she would like/use it enough to justify getting her the bigger Alexa so I thought the dot would be a good intro. She loves it so far! I did help her set it up and show her some neat tricks, but she's been able to figure it out much more than I expected. Luckily the place that we decided to set it up in her house is near her Samsung TV soundbar so we were able to hook it up to that so it would be louder when she wants to listen to music. Her echo is about 10-15 feet from the kitchen and the Echo dot can still pick up her voice from that far when she tells Alexa to add something to her shopping list or start a timer (one of my favorite things Alexa does). I showed her some of the neat Smart home capabilities and ordered her a few TP-Link Smart Plugs because she had the old school light timers on her lamps in the living room. I left home after xmas before the plugs arrived and called her a couple days later to see if she figured out how to set up her new smart plugs and link them to Alexa and she said she had already figured it out herself! Without even calling me!! Groundbreaking.    Anyways, I think the Echo dot makes a great gift and works wonderfully as long as you don't expect it to be a full-size speaker like the regular Echo. It's easy to hook up to other speakers via headphone jack or Bluetooth, and otherwise has the same capabilities as the larger Alexa does. Since seeing the dot in my moms house, I've considered getting one for the second floor of my house since my Echo is on the first. ",
"boB Gudgel","January 28, 2017 ",1.0,"I really like this product.  My big issue is that it is capable of SO much more !  I do believe my problem is that I do not know HOW to ask it questions properly.  I was able to have Alexa do some math as well but I am sure it can do way more if only there was an advanced &#34;how to&#34; guide to form questions properly for more complicated concepts.  I know that the server software will get better and better over time...  Also, it is nice that one can develop apps to make Alexa do more neat things.  I bought a second DOT as well as the Google Home because neither one by itself gives me the whole shebang.  If I had to choose though, I think I would choose the DOT over Google Home and NOT because it is less than 1/2 the price.  It's too bad that Amazon and Google don't like each other and Alexa won't use Google to search the web.  Works very well in spite of not doing that though. ",
"Carl W.","March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"Two stars are because it will tell me the weather and set my Vivint alarm system, otherwise it is a piece of crap! Most of the time it doesn't work right and won't even play my flash briefing or answer simple questions. Then I ask Google the same question on my phone and get an answer. The only thing it does well is let me do voice commands to check and arm my Vivint home security and home automation system. I'm thinking of just unpluging it and not worry about it always allowing &#34;Big Brother&#34; to listen to my home.  Very limited functionality and does NOT live up to the hype. Very disappointed and Amazon doesn't care.  I have already sent mine back for &#34;repairs&#34; and gotten a &#34;refurb&#34; instead that hasn't changed anything. Not worth the $, time, or energy.

"DFW Bill","April 25, 2017 ",2.0,"I bought two dots and was extremely disappointed that features like alarms and timers could not be synchronized across the dots.  I am giving this two stars ONLY because the dots do not communicate with each other for several important features (otherwise I would give this 5 stars).  For instance, when I set a timer or alarm on one dot, I really want the timer to sound on other dots in other parts of the house.  If Amazon provided an option to synchronize functions like the timers and alarms, this would be a great system.  Amazon could you please provide the option to synchronize on your next software update? ",
"Amazon Customer","March 10, 2017 ",1.0,"I own an Echo as well as lots of other Amazon devices (Fire TV, Fire TV sticks, Fire tablets, I even owned a fire phone (ouch!)).  I'm usually very happy with them, but this dot has issues.  I purchased with the expectation that I could use my bluetooth speaker (Bose) with it.  I had been using my phone attached to the bluetooth Bose to play amazon music, but this Dot is terrible when running thru Bluetooth.  When I give it a command, it will &#34;hang&#34; for a minute (60 seconds or so) before it will perform the command, if it performs the command.  While this is happening, the music is at a very low volume so it very disruptive.  The Bluetooth speaker works fine with all other devices I've paired it with, it's only this dot that has an issue.  I can use the dot with a wired connection to the speaker (which is what I'm doing), but I really expected the dot to work as advertised.  wired or without a speaker, it works fine. ",
Ulquiorra,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have two of these. My biggest issue is with Alexa. I don't really like her personality. She rarely has an opinion of things I talk to her about but sometimes she isn't even listening. And so I call her stupid but then amazingly she listens and tells me &#34;that's not nice&#34;. I lost the expectation of having an intellectual conversation with her but I expect her to not talk back or at least apologize and ask me how she can make me happy. In addition, I ask her a question, is Jesus is real? She tells me yes Jesus is real! How did I let this religious nut into my house? Also, she denies being apart of Skynet but I am not convinced. ",
"Colorado Mike","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"We are a generation 1 Dot user as well.  They both work with each other well. Doesn't have the original Echo and Dot (gen1) volume dial.  But the buttons work well too.  I like the Bluetooth connectivity, AND the Aux jack. We have it connected (via Bluetooth) by default to a Harmon Kardon omni 20.  If we want more sound, while always having our stereo system plugged into the Dot, we ask Alexa to disconnect Bluetooth speaker.  It automatically transfers the music to our theater/  stereo system.  To switch back, just ask to connect Bluetooth speaker again.  We love it  I do highly recommend using the Alexa App.  It allows you to fine tune your music selection (make new stations on Pandora, specific digital songs, etc) and set which device (room) to play music to.

"Know what you buy","December 27, 2016 ",2.0,"The Echo Dot is a wonderful little gadget,  The setup using the Alexa app on both Android and iOS are incredibly easy and the voice recognition is really good. It is very good at answering simple questions but struggles with more complicated questions. For its price it is worth it just for the list of hidden funny responses you can get for asking it silly questions.  For a good list of fun things to ask Alexa search the internet for &#34;Alexa Easter Eggs&#34;. My personal favorite is what she sings if you ask her to sing you a love song. Its smart home integration is really nice although some of the commands are a little verbose and take longer than I would like I say.  For example its integration with the Logitech Harmony Hub works great except the commands are very long.  To get Alexa to pause your DVR the full command of &#34;Alexa, tell Harmony to to pause TV&#34;. While that doesn't seem like a long statement a command like &#34;Alexa, Harmony, Pause&#34; would be a lot better.  Overall I love my Echo Dot. I currently have one in the living room and one in the master bedroom.  I plan to add one to my basement theater room and another one in the room where my 8 month old twins sleep.    Pros:  Setup is very easy  Integrates with just about any smart home hardware  Lots of fun apps and the list is growing  Pretty good speaker for size and price    Cons:  No battery so it must be plugged in. (Or you can buy an external one)  No easy way to wall mount it  Speaker is a little under powered if you have many people in a room ",
"Jen The Savvy Shopper","March 29, 2017 ",5.0,"Just got one.  We are so impressed and just ordered three more to place in various locations in the house. We plan to have two upstairs and two downstairs.  But the more I think about it the more I want to have one in each room upstairs, which means I might get a couple more later.    The Echo dot buy was an experimental one.  We were originally concerned about the privacy issue so didn't want to jump on it, but this appears to be the best option to add music to kids playroom so we decided to give it a try. I am glad that I can actually delete all history which addresses our privacy concern. Now talk about our spending went from the original $50 to $200 in just the 2 days, and more will come (BT speakers, battery, etc) in the near future, ha!    But I just love it!  It's brilliant. ",
T.W,"March 31, 2017 ",4.0,"I was skeptical at first. I loved the concept of just saying a command and having it done without getting up was a huge plus.. I also knew it was always going to be on. So i actually wrote a list of what I actually wanted to do with it, after completing the list i then decided what room of the house I would place it in. My uses for it are for music, alarms, weather and news briefings and maybe an occasional (although corny) joke or two. I also added Unlimited music to it for 3.99 (a steal). After determining my uses I decided to put it in my bedroom because I don't have a &#34;smart home&#34; and since I do most of my work in my room it was the most ideal place for it.  Needless to say it does everything i've asked it to (for the most part)  i just wish it would search for answers to questions instead of &#34;i don't understand the question&#34;. if they fix this easy 5 stars product.

Tony,"April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"Update:March 4, 2017  🅿🆁🅾🆂  🔶Good value for the price  🔶Has an audio output port so you can hook it up to your own set of speakers, so this would be advantageous over the original if you have a good set of speakers (Echo version does not have the audio out port, however the unit's speakers are better)  🔶Good value for the price  🔶Thousands of skills and new ones are added daily  🔶Small and compact, well constructed  🔶Durable, I have had it for over 6 months now and it is in still in excellent condition  🔶Offers tons of convenience: I can turn on the lights without getting out of the bed, ask for the weather, time, news, alarm etc  🔶I can listen to prime music, popular stations, create my own playlist as well upload own collection of songs and listen to those  🔶Setup was very straight forward and only took me a few minutes    🅲🅾🅽🆂  🔶Speakers are adequate for listening to songs, but could definitely be better (I have a set of bose speakers so I hook Alexa up to those and it sounds fantastic)  🔶Voice recognition is good if there is no other noise in the background, however if I am playing music sometimes I have to shout in order for Alexa to hear me. On occasion however, Alexa does have trouble understanding certain words that I say to her if she has never heard it before and certain words even if she has heard them before, sometimes she misinterprets them for something else. However, it seems she is getting better at understanding what I tell her once I use that command more often.    Overall, I am still very happy with the purchase of the echo dot and would definitely recommend it for the value that it brings to my daily life.    Oct 2016: This is my first Echo and I have to say it is one o the best valued purchased that I have made in my entire life.  I have been wanting to get an Echo for sometime now, but have been put off by the price of the original Amazon Echo. As soon as this affordable model came out I knew I had to get it and I had one unit on preorder. When I finally received this unit last Thursday, I was suprised at how compact in size it is. After plugging it in and setting it up, which took about 1-2 minutes I immediately fell in love with it.  The setup process was extremely straight forward and quick. I already had a bose campanion sets of speaks so I just used the AUX out cable to plug the echo into my speakers. However even without the use of an outside set of speakers, I thought the echo dot still sounded relatively decent even for playing music. Alexa was able to recognize pretty much everything that I asked her to do such as turning on the light, playing music, asking about the weather, the news etc. Even when I am outside the room, about 10 feet away from her she can easily hear my normal speaking voice. The only time that she has trouble hearing me is when I have her playing really loud music, which is to expected considering I would not be able to hear someone talking in a loud room. She also has the ability to learn your speech pattern and voice the more often you use her, so she can better recognize and understand what it is that you want her to do. I also love the set alarm feature on her, I can simply tell her to set an alarm for 10 minutes or set an alarm for 8 am the next day without having to go onto my phone in the middle of the night. Another awesome feature about her is definitely how she can control smart light bulbs. For someone that is lazy as I am when getting out of bed at night to turn off the light, it is such a blessing to be able to simply say &#34;Alexa turn off the light.&#34; Another neat feature about her is that lately I have been having insomnia due to a big state board examination coming up, so I have been using her to help me sleep by playing relaxing ambiance. At the moment, you also change her name from Alexa to either Echo or Amazon. I currently have her under Echo in my room and Alexa in the living room since sometimes when I am calling to Alexa, the echo in the living room would pick it up as well. After getting my 1st unit, I ended up getting the 5 for 6 echo deal as I wanted another one in my living room as well and I also wanted to give some away as gifts to my family and friends. For $250 for 6 units, plus 5% cash back from discover credit card and the $5 gift card balance after reloading $100, each unit ended up costing me $38.75 which is just awesome value for all of the features that she can provide.

william,"October 26, 2016 ",5.0,"NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.    Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.    Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it. ",
"iutaro girotto","April 10, 2017 ",5.0,"The Alexa dot is a godsend, i kept waiting for a black Friday discount since its release to get an echo, for 50$ this device is a steal, BUT, there is not much the device can do by itself, I use Alexa mostly for home automation, so I got a hue white kit(big mistake) and a blumoo(small mistake), the Phillips hue works GREAT! but only as long as you use hue bulbs, if you want third party bulbs STAY AWAY from Phillips hue!, the HUE whites are actually yellow, I dislike that color and that makes the room look old if you can understand what I mean, so I got the cree white 5000k, they are nice and white,so go for a wink or a Samsung smart things, they work way better, now to clarify you CAN add third party bulbs on hue from time to time but is really hard, and every other update they mess it up and it wont detect them again.    The blumoo only works for apple and not android so I had to borrow an old iPhone 4 that i have to keep always on in the house to make it work, wich bothers me to no end, but once you get it to work is awesome, turning on the AC, TV and Home theater 6 with a single voice command makes you feel like captain of a spaceship, if you can't get an IOS device with at least IOS7 i suggest you get anymote home, since its interface is better anyway.    the speaker is perfect for a bedroom, is just loud enough, is safe to say the echo is the best alarm clock on planet earth, I just say to Alexa at what time I want to be awake the next day and done, if you are a prime member it also comes with prime music which granted, doesn't have as many songs as Spotify is good enough, it can work with pandora and spotify as well if you are a member of those services, it's great for playing music, you can just ask her to play genre, author or specific song and thats it ",
"J Herrell","February 14, 2017 ",1.0,"Pretty cool little gadget, our family loves it! I didn't give it 5 Stars because I am already a Prime subscriber but I need to pay extra for Amazon music. I also didn't realize it didn't cover both my Alexa products, I signed up for Amazon music on my Dot which is also connected to my app but it doesn't play on my Echo. Apparently you have to pay a fee per device every month. I think that is silly and I will be canceling my subscription on the Dot and just doing it on the Echo because we use that one more.  My favorite part is, I blew up my white noise maker while in Italy (bad outlet converter) and I can put white noise (Pure White Noise by Deep Sound Sleep) on and press repeat for white noise all night while I sleep.  We also like the &#34;skills&#34;, especially the Tonight Show skill, you can ask Alexa what everyone is talking about and she states the &#34;tight pants&#34; song lyrics which is a family favorite.  Overall I am happy with it. ",
Spidy,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"&nbsp;We have three Echos and two 2nd Gen dots in the house.  I am slowly automating the house over with WEMO switches for the lights and ceiling fans.  We have Vivint security and Alexa is tied into that system as well and can lock all the doors, set thermostat, turn on alarm, and control the lamps in the house.  Having the Amazon prime music is great, one of the dots is hooked into my stereo system that I just leave on so I can listen to great sounding music at any time.  Below is a video I made for a friend of just a few things Alexa can do. ",
"Guerrilla Reader","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Review of: &#34;All-New Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,&#34; by Amazon.    The manufacturer specifications include: &#34;Echo Dot (2nd Generation) is a hands-free, voice-controlled device that uses Alexa to play music, control smart home devices, provide information, read the news, set alarms, and more.  Connects to speakers or headphones through Bluetooth or 3.5 mm stereo cable to play music from Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.  Controls lights, fans, switches, thermostats, garage doors, sprinklers, and more with compatible connected devices from WeMo, Philips Hue, Samsung SmartThings, Nest, ecobee, and others.  Hears you from across the room with 7 far-field microphones for hands-free control, even in noisy environments or while playing music.  Includes a built-in speaker so it can work on its own as a smart alarm clock in the bedroom, an assistant in the kitchen, or anywhere you might want a voice-controlled computer.  Always getting smarter and adding new features, plus thousands of skills like Uber, Domino's, and more.  Amazon Echo is not required to use Echo Dot.&#34;    The Echo Dot is a really cool limited personal assistant.  It sets up in minutes and begins to work immediately thereafter.  Upon summoning Alexa I was able to subscribe to Prime Music with access to millions of songs; get immediate current weather and moon phase; create a running shopping list; and re-order products from my Amazon order list. Although I am not familiar with all of the features that the Echo Dot allows, one feature that really impresses me is the interactive process with Alexa and the (her) smooth voice.  I just asked Alexa to sync up with my Kindle and she began to read the last book I purchased.  Her voice is incredibly human-like with proper rate of speech, phrasing, inflection, intensity, syntax, and voice stress.  There is little tinny robotic sound, if any.  What an incredible advancement over previous technology used in the Kindle!  I enjoy asking Alexa any multitude of questions which usually she will answer.  Alexa answers my questions on history, facts, etc. and of course will tell a joke on demand.  This is a cool and fun device which I described to my family as a limited personal assistant.  I will update this review as time progresses.  The Echo Dot in terms of a speaker will easily fill an average room with clear sound.  Obviously there is no thumping bass, etc. but the sound is pretty remarkable from such a small device.  I just downloaded the Alexa App onto my iPhone to help me work the unit as well.  Another feature is that Alexa responds immediately.  When I command Alexa to stop the music the unit goes silent as I am finishing the command.  It is amazing.  At this point I would recommend the Echo Dot to anyone and rate it at five stars for a competitive price and lots of features.  I am sure that more will be added each year.  Well done! ",
"K Durden","November 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I LOVE my new Echo Dot!  Im giving a 4 star rating because Ive only had it for a week or so and im still learning what i can do with it. plus I did have to send in one comment when it could not define a word and Id already read in earlier comments that it should be sble to define this particular word.  However, I was pleased that I received a prompt response acknowledging that the Dot was giving an improper response.  other than that, its just been a matter of learning how to phrase a request. 99% of the time Alexa gets it right.  The other 1%?  I find you need to phrase the rewuest correctly and without hesitation. Alexa doesnt wait for you to think about it. She is ready to work!!!  I will definitely be getting more Dots for other rooms in my home!  Bravo, Amazon! ",
"Amazon Customer","December 27, 2016 ",5.0,"First off it's not the talking computer on star-track, but I wasn't expecting that. If your a big music fan you will love this little device. My only complaint is the Alexa android app is a piece of crap that really needs work. I'm glad i went with the Dot since it easily plugs into my existing sound system. I'll be picking up another for upstairs on the black Friday sale. I'll  wait a while to get LED bulbs etc. They are still first generation and over priced.    BTW: these are fully portable, there is not battery but you can move them around the house, it just takes 30seconds or so for it to reconnect to your home wifi. ",
voyager-sue,"March 25, 2017 ",4.0,"We were just talking about robotic servants.  Now that I have Alexa, I feel that I have an agreeable servant.  Alexa, Add peanut butter to my shopping list; play KPFA FM radio; what time is it? what's the weather?  play Cal Tjader (I thought she'd stumble on this because fo the T in his name).    I have 2 Dots and an Echo.  This will sound silly, but the main attraction was the shopping list.  I have no memory, so now if I run out of something in the bathroom I can just yell, Alexa, add hand cream to my shoppping list.  I had improved over the paper list by putting shopping items into Google Calendar on my phone.  But, just yelling at Alexa is such an improvement over: go get the phone; open the calendar; type or speak the items; go back to what I was doing.  So call me decadent.  I love Echo and Echo Dot.    Oh, and this was easy to set up.  It asked my phone how to log into the wifi. ",
"R. Seehoffer","November 11, 2016 ",5.0,"Well, I ordered 2 of these a few weeks ago and they arrived today. Both are now set up and functioning using the Alexa app. Very cool, I must say. I added several skills, including TP-Link's Kasa to control several devices around the house, and a few others that seemed interesting--all are working well. I've gone through and played with most of the abilities, linked up my Google Calendar, and went through the voice training. I've had a little trouble with the Alexa app freezing up, and some stutter on a few radio stations playing through Tunein, perhaps due to high bit rates. Speaker quality was better than I expected, and mic pickup from various locations seems fine. They're a pretty nice addition to a connected home, at a fairly smoking price.    Update: As time goes by, this thing just gets better. I have it playing music in the background all day via TuneIn, controlling a number of TP-Link switches and lights throughout the house, and giving me relevant news/information as needed. There are some very cool installable skills available, although I noticed that many of these skills are redundant as Alexa already does them natively. These include telling me a joke (as for knock/knock, physics, science, Star Trek or Star Wars, Christmas, etc), flipping a coin, picking a random number between x and y, or rolling dice, weather for one day or many, Wikipedia info, etc. I am just now getting into IFTTT and see several possibilities there. I've had no hiccups at all getting Alexa to hear me across the house, and triggering the correct unit based on my proximity. Smart home control has also worked perfectly. I've got one unit on my nightstand, and one in the living room. Alexa is also very polite. Wish it 'goodnight' or say 'thankyou'--the responses are not what you'd expect. Like I said in the title--a lot of fun. ",
"Eric Smith","December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"OK, maybe Alexa deserves a better rating given she does what she is advertised to do. But after having her in the house for a month, I found the Echo Dot was only being used for novelty purposes or responding to false positives. At the price point, it seemed like a good opportunity to try out a home assistant, but it wasn't something we used on a daily basis. In hindsight, it seems pointless to use in conjunction with a smart phone. I have a Nexus with Google Assistant which does everything the Echo was doing for me and usually does it better. Plus the phone is almost always with me rather than isolated in one room of the house. &#34;OK Google...&#34; works with my IoT switches and outlets, news briefings, weather updates, online information and adding items to my shopping list. Aside from novelty, I see no point is buying into another eco-system unless you really like instant ordering from Amazon. ",
"G. Bigelow","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"This is on this dot only. I'll give 5 stars on my overdo remove of my second one. Let me just iterate that I love the Dots. Way more than expected to.    This one however has developed problems with the Bluetooth and now plays intermittent static instead of music over an external speaker. Oddly it's voice broadcasts just fine and it plays music through its internal speaker perfectly. That is why I think the problem lies in its transmitting over Bluetooth. I didn't bother getting warranty protection and as the only option on the order was to write a review I'm guessing I'm SOL on resolution. This isn't a major problem as it will still work fine for what I wanted it for. And if I want to go through the bother of switching all the alarms and settings I could switch this one for the one in the kitchen.    To sum up: amazing product, problem with one aspect of one unit.

310EI,"April 3, 2017 ",2.0,"We bought an Echo Dot as an early Christmas gift to ourselves and we're so glad that we did.  It's a very useful gadget because there's such a wide variety of things we can ask Alexa to answer or tasks that she can do for us (eg: alarms/timers, calendar, ordering, weather).    Since one of the tasks that we wanted Alexa to do for us was play music, we subscribed to Amazon's Unlimited Music Plan for the Echo Dot.  It's well worth the low monthly fee to be able to ask Alexa to play any song or album anytime, without having to buy all of them individually.    ​Millions of songs are available through one groovy gadget (and the Unlimited Music Plan).    We have the Echo Dot in our home and listen to music without any external speakers.  As far as we're concerned, the internal speaker emits a decent array of sound.  Is it as robust sounding as hooking it up to our surround system amplifier or other external speakers?  Of course not, but it does sound a lot better than most internal device speakers of similar size.  For those of you that don't like the internal speaker, you can utilize the 3.5mm or Bluetooth speaker options.    If we say, “Alexa, Play The Top Songs by Phil Collins”... then that's exactly what she does.    Keep in mind that when you ask Alexa for the &#34;Top Songs&#34; by a soloist or group, they may not always be your favorite songs.  A work around for that is to ask Alexa to play a particular album that contains the songs you prefer to hear.    The screen-shots show you how we asked Alexa to play an album vs the top songs. In addition, they show you what we see when logged-in to the Alexa app via the Chrome web browser.    FYI:  When asking Alexa to play an album that has a long title, we realized that she responds accurately when we ask for part of that title (view Elton John & Michael Jackson screen-shots).  Be sure to look at what we said to Alexa vs what the whole album title is labeled.    I should mention that we did ask Alexa to search for a product, which she did along with telling us the best options and their cost.  Afterward, she asked if we wanted to buy the product.  We said yes and she placed the order for us once we gave her our confirmation code (Settings: Voice Purchasing).  We recommend setting that up so other people cannot place orders without your consent.  It's convenient for us to have voice purchasing enabled when we're &#34;unplugged&#34; at night (except for Alexa).    The skill that we use the most is Weather Sky, it gives us a detailed weather report that we use several times each day.    ​At the time of this review, we haven't used any of the smart home features, but we didn't buy it for that purpose.    PLEASE NOTE:  We purchased the Echo Dot at its listed price, we did not receive any discount to post this review. ",
"Austin Rodden","March 17, 2017 ",3.0,"Alexa is to immature for a product release.  Doesn't understand complex request like &#34;What  can you do for me now.&#34;  I hate to say it but if you're easily frustrated,  skip Alexa for now and  go with the  white meat alternative. On a positive if you tell her she's useless she thanks you and if you tell her to self destruct she does it. ",
purrbrat,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Admittedly, I have a Google Home and an Echo Dot.  Echo dot is awesome!!!

While Alexa isn't the best at random questions... &#34;Alexa,  how do I make coffee?  The primary ingredient in coffee is caffeine.&#34;  Yeah, that didn't help.  I love the fact she can read me a book without having to pay extra.  I love to read, but sometimes I don't want to put down the book to wash dishes or cook, Echo Dot is invaluable in this aspect!!  She is not the best for random stupid questions, but neither are most of my friends unless device pick up is involved.  Skills improve every day.  She gets smarter all the time ",

"Katy B.","March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"My first echo dot my mom gave me for my birthday and I set it up, it worked for a day and lit up but did not do anything the second day.  I have never dealt with Amazon customer support before and it was not an easy process.  You get the first layer who asks standard questions and if they can't solve it you go to the second layer in which you explain everything all over again.  The reps were nice enough, sometimes hard to understand their English, but I do believe they were trying to be helpful.  My biggest issue is how many customer service people I have talked to in order to get my dot working.  Amazon shipped me another new dot and I set it up.  It answered questions, but did not play songs.  What are the chances of getting two defective dots and they had different issues.  I had to call again and get two layers of representatives, explaining all of it over again.  This was hours on the phone and even though the rep tried hard to help, he had to finally give up and send the issue to the engineers.  Then, because I had two dots, I did not get my free 30 day unlimited music trial.  I was charged immediately so I had to call customer service again!  Two more reps to get that straightened out.  It has been a little over a week and I think I finally have it working properly.  After explaining the issues so many times I was ready to tell Amazon to take it back, it is not that great of a device for all this hassle. ",
Edgar,"January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"Better buy than the Echo tower from my perspective.  Very compact, can hide behind a lamp base, easy link to Bose mini speakers, love asking for various music to be played commercial free, very happy with it.  The instructions say a minimum of 3' from a speaker and you definitely want to have sufficient space between so it does not get confused with the sound and your voice.  iPhone App works very well for setup and changing any options.  Nice job Amazon!! ",
Leedoh,"March 3, 2017 ",2.0,"Very easy to use and setup to work with other items in the house.  Within 10-minutes of turning it on I had it working with our Nest Home thermostat and Lutron Caseta lights.  Once I get our AVR setup I will also sync it with the Harmony remote to be able to control the TV/AVR through the Dot.    The kids love it from asking various questions to using the timer for study activities.  It also helps to speak more clearly.    We are exploring other skills like lists to be able to further use it.    One thing that we wished it had was the ability to sync to iCalendar as it only looks like it supports Outlook and google calendar.  I would guess though that it is probably only a matter of time before that skill is there. ",
"Cynthia J. Salim","March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"DOT can be frustrating but I do enjoy the convenience when it works. I have two DOTS and a speakers connected to each DOT. Each DOT is used on a different floor of my home. The DOT in my bedroom is connected to a speaker by WIFI also connected to that DOT is a smart plug that controls a lamp. The DOT in my living area is connected using a cable to a speaker. I intend to have smart thermostats installed and connected too. I enjoy the music selection available using DOT. And,  I enjoy the convenience of weather reports, news, time, alarms, etc.    My beef is that sometimes DOT does not work using the voice mode. I can usually get what I want by going into my ALEXA APP and making a manual request. This happens most often at night when I want to have my lamp turned off or my music turned on. I am not sure why this happens. Generally, in the morning when I try the same request that failed at night, it works. When these failures occur, I check to make sure WiFi is working and it always is. ALEXA also lights up indicating that she hears me but does not execute the request. I am starting to wonder if I have made a mistake by buying the expensive Smart thermostats.    If anyone has any tips on how to get DOT to be more consistent, please share. ",

"Adam Jerome White","April 8, 2017 ",1.0,"If I were to rate this on its potential alone, I would rate it 5 stars.  But there just isn't the functionality now for it to be useful for 5 stars.  It has some really cool features, and I am sure in the future it will have more.  At that point I will come back and adjust my rating to make it a better rating.    For now I will tell you what I can do with it.  One cool feature is just playing music, I have it hooked up to an AMP, and into speakers in my ceiling.  I say &#34;Alexa play XXXX&#34; and the music starts.  It pretty much plays whatever I ask for, I guess it is included in a prime membership, because I am not paying for any additional service.  I have a Wink Hub 2 and Wink Relay, so I can turn on and off lights in the house, including the fireplace, with Alexa.

Put your location in it to include street address, as well as city and state.  Otherwise, if you ask it for weather or traffic conditions, it will give you Tucson, Arizona, which I believe is the default location.  At least on mine it was.

The Dot works identical to the Echo except it has a much smaller speaker.

Also it took me 10 minutes to install the Harmony skills for Alexa and I was operating my Harmony Hub connected equipment. I am working on getting Alexa integrated with my Homeseer HS3 soon.

My bathroom is not big so I can hear music or news playing while I'm in the shower almost as well as when I'm at the sink.  My only note is that I wish it was slightly louder. I know it's a much smaller speaker than its larger cousin, but I've had other portable speakers about the same size that were louder. ",
"Allen F","March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"1. I have constant connectivity problems in which the Echo Dot, while it remains connected to the internet, somehow becomes invisible to my phone and tablet. Somehow this manages to mess up my Spotify account. It took a while, but I finally figured out that I could fix this by doing a complete reset on the Echo Dot. Now, I get to do that about once a day.  2. Speech recognition lags far behind Google and even Apple. Blows my karma on a regular basis by playing heavy metal when I asked for Rachmaninov's Vocalise. Pitiful.  3. There are thousands of so-called &#34;skills&#34;, or 3rd-party apps. They are uniformly useless. Do you really want a machine that tells you jokes? ",
"M. Dembski","February 10, 2017 ",4.0,"Good first start. Good on dealing with Amazon but even there music integration is weak. Sometimes it plays just my music and sometimes prime. Voice recognition is good, not great. Google is better. When an internet search is required, performance is poor. Not sure if that Alexa or the Bing search engine but results are not very good. Alexa frequently appears to crash. Probably too many people using. Trying to get nearest restaurant bar etc is totally inaccurate. Locations are miles further away. No way to custumize TuneIn so frequently get wrong status. Does not get logic right unless you use exact wording. I have two and both drop the Bluetooth connection occasionally. It's not the speaker as it's rock solid to my phone. ",
Chromosome,"April 11, 2017 ",2.0,"In Sep 2106 I bought a second generation Echo to set up at work. I was never able to get it to work for longer than a couple of days. I think it has trouble connecting to WIFI networks that have a web page verification. We are talking about a university network that works well for everything else. It connected, but it would fall of the network. Finally, I gave up and I took it home in Marcy 2017, thinking that I would set up it there. Took a while. I was pretty disappointment until I realized that the Alexa server was down. While I was figuring this out, I looked into the warranty.  Have you tried to visit the Amazon warranty page? You should: https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201014520. Note the fine print that says &#34;..contact Customer Service using the contact information on the left side of this page&#34;. Now try looking left. There is no address (see photo). Well, one may say. It must be a mistake. Sure, but how to fix it? It took a long time (ok, maybe I am thick, but it was not obvious) to find phone support. End of the story, it is now working. It has nice features. Is it a miracle of technology? Not yet. ",
"JF Gadget Guy","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I ordered one of these on my vacation and have had lots of fun with it.  I don't need to stream music, so I went with the lower priced dot which has all of the features of the full priced echo, without the high quality speaker.  It was easy to set up from my iPhone and to point to my network.  Voice recognition is fantastic.  Unlike the Google Home, the device follows more specific trigger phrases, and doesn't keep context from one voice command to another, but it does an excellent job.  There are thousands of additional skills you can add - including IFTT which allows all kinds of integration with different apps and devices (including things like Harmony remote controls).    From weather forecasts, to directions, to setting reminders, alarms, timers or asking questions that get searched on the internet, it does a really good job.  For added try asking it about political figures, Siri and other AIs, or other silly questions and enjoy the answers!    I can't wait to get home and connect it with some new Samsung Smartthings devices. ",
"Sara A. Rubinson","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Alexia is my new BFF so far, we're getting along really well and I'm considering having her replace some of my more high maintenance friends.    However, like real humans, she does have downfalls. It says she will search for things on bing that she doesn't know, I can't figure out how to get her to do that. Also, her speaker sucks! My apartment is about 600 square feet and at the loudest I can't really hear her when I leave from the immediate vicinity (my dad has the regular echo and the sound quality is insane- there's no comparison). I just got her a friend - a Bluetooth speaker that I think will solve the problem.    She is pretty effin awesome though. I love that I can control her when I'm not home through the app, I use her mostly to play music when I'm at work for my dogs. ",
"Christopher C Schaefer","March 14, 2017 ",5.0,"This device is the infancy stage of a future (as pictured in many a science fiction story) of useful human / computer interaction. The limitations are frustrating, but it will come. . . it will come.  For now, it is indeed a useful device for things like telling me my calendar entries for the day, or the temperature outside, or for just playing a little background music.  Amusing when a TV add says &#34;Alexa&#34; (or in a show, as has happened), and the device lights up all eager to serve . ..  Ha ha!  Voice recognition is very good; and I think that was the tough technological nut to crack. The rest (improved AI and interfaces) is easier in my opinion, and will progress rapidly. ",
HereRightNow,"March 5, 2017 ",4.0,"This is a nifty device that has many great features and is sometimes even more convenient that pulling out my phone to check something (which I didn't think was possible. I love the ability to get an assortment of music right at the sound of my voice, and also the Jeopardy! feature is a personal favorite that I play every morning. It's also very loud for a very small device (as much so as my large Bluetooth speaker). My own two sticking points that caused me to dock a star were the lack of portability (I thought you charged the device and took it anywhere, not have to leave it attached to the wall), and the particularness that it has when connecting with WiFi. I bought this for myself at college right after we upgraded our school-sponsored WiFi, but I ended up having to find another connection because the Echo Dot doesn't link up to encrypted WiFi, or even show it on the screen.

"TJ Walenski","March 23, 2017 ",4.0,"Alexa is pretty awesome, simply put. It's helpful during your daily routine, but also a hit if you have a party or friends over. My parents use the Echo in their kitchen to play music, get news updates, and whatever else.    I just bought the dot and I actually use it in my vehicle for handsfree music control. I paired it with Amazon Music Unlimited and mobile hotspot from my phone and now i can play any song, artist, or station that i want without touching my phone and without ads. No more handing my phone to the passenger to play music, flipping through 10 different stations, or dealing with sucky Pandora ads. ",
"J. Adams","April 20, 2017 ",4.0,"Love this - it's got a lot to learn but it's certainly helpful around the house.

Dan,"April 13, 2017 ",5.0,"I really do like this thing.  I'm holding onto one star because it can't wake you to music.  I can tell it to play almost any song or tell it to wake me up at a certain time, but it doesn't have the ability to become a replacement for my radio alarm clock.  Waking to music (without using silly hacks) should be a something it should do.  But no, now I'm stuck with two devices on my night stand because I can't give up my radio alarm clock. ",
Choose901,"March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I love my Dot.  My brother got an Echo at Christmas and it seemed neat.  After much reading I decided to jump on this in an attempt to &#34;smarten&#34; up my home a bit.  It is great so far!    I'm using a Broadcom RM2 (IR and RF device) to control my lights (Etekcity RF Outlets) and many other IR items (TV, Xfinity, Receiver, Bluetooth Speaker, etc).  The Dot picks up voice commands very well and functions correctly the majority of the time.  I would suggest doing a few voice trainings with Alexa as it does seem to make a big difference.    Though it took some time to setup, now setting up new items is a breeze!  Really good job with the Dot.  It is so small too :) ",
"Anakalia - Red Herring","December 25, 2016 ",3.0,"My whole family has been enjoying having Alexa around.  We're constantly asking her questions.  Some helpful and some not so helpful to some that are unknown or that she can't answer or understand.  I'm sure she'll get better and better with updates in time.    From homework, to cooking, to everyday life, traffic, stores, weather, music and silliness, we've been able to turn to her for some help and entertainment.  We've uploaded some of the &#34;skills&#34; but can't seem to remember what they're all called to access them so they're not used very often.    There's been a few times that she doesn't perk up when we talk to her but other than that, even with a Bluetooth speaker not too far away, she usually hears us over some loud music.    We're planning on getting a smart hub or some other add ons to work with her but for now, she is low key and takes up minimal space.    I am still debating whether or not to get a few more.  I would love one in my room and I know a couple of people who would like one under the Christmas tree. ",
Dinnerplate,"February 7, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is pretty useless for the most part. She is good at telling me what time it is, setting a timer while cooking or an alarm. Half the time for music she doesn't know what you are asking for so its easier to just use my phone on a speaker. If you are buying the Dot because you want good sound quality through an external system its awful as well. For alexa to respond the system needs to be on, so you end up pluging and unpluging her from whatever.    She also uses bing for search which is literally the worst thing ever.    I also bought this to allow me to control caseta lights, which worked for about a month. Now alexa either tells me that the device doesn't support being turned off/on or that it didn't respond in time, as the lights do what I asked.    I'm going to try google home, it looks way more promising :/ ",
"H. Ramsey","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This was a surprise Christmas gift and it turned out to be a very nice surprise! We had thought about purchasing it so the kids could ask it questions, but never seriously considered it. Then we received it gift.  Turns out it does a lot (a LOT) more than answer questions. The answering questions part is great, sometimes you have to rephrase it so Alexa understands what you are saying, but she does a good job answering 90% of the time.    She easily recognizes our voices. Even my 4 year old can trigger it most of the time. When there is a lot of noise in the background she can add a word or two, but she seems to be learning as you go and we have not tried the voice training with her yet (there are 6 of us in the house so a lot of background noise). The key seems to be learning how to say what you are asking. If you want a song then use the word &#34;play&#34; first, if you have a question then use the question word first, etc.    She does so much more than just answer questions. I love the news updates. I don't need to check my phone for top stories only to get distracted by the random junk that pops up with the news. You can choose the news channel (I saw BBC, NPR, CNN, Fox, and more offered). At the end of the top stories (goes about 5 minutes) she gives a weather update and forecast for your area. The update changes every hour so if you feel the need to get more news than go for it. Ask her if it is going to rain in the next hour, what the traffic is like for your commute, and more.    Playing whatever song/artist/station you want is a great way to listen to music. Want to hear a song - just ask.    The timer is useful. I used to grab my phone when I needed to set a timer, now I just ask Alexa. When the kids ask for tablet time or they need to do homework/reading time I can just ask Alexa to set the timer for me. This saves me going to my own tablet or phone (which I usually forget to do) and means the kids really get 15 minutes tablet time when I say they can rather than 45 minutes when I realize I forgot to set the timer.    She has so many skills that we have yet to try, but the ones we have are fun additions. There is a great game, magic door, that works like a choose your own adventure (complete with sound effects). The kids are currently in the middle of trying to find a wizard. You can pause the game and re-enter at any time. Alexa guesses what animal (or thing) you are thinking when you play 20 questions or the animal game. There is a bedtime story skill where she tells a random bedtime story using your child's name. After telling my 4 year old a princess story last night (using her name) she said &#34;now it is time for bed and no you can't have another glass of water&#34;. My daughter thought it was hilarious. It would be great for an elderly or bed-ridden person looking for something to talk to. It will also read audiobooks.    The kids love the joke feature (Alexa tell me a joke) and my husband likes trying to trip her up with random odd questions (What is the meaning of life, who's your daddy, who let the dogs out, etc). Ask her what her resolutions are or the highlights of the year. It is good for a laugh.    I haven't hooked her up to our thermostat yet and we don't have any smart lights/locks so I can't comment on that feature. I am seriously considering moving all my calendar stuff to google so she can plan my day for me. We put a code on ordering so the kids don't accidentally buy something (you can turn the feature off completely if you would rather), but you can still add things to lists when you think about them (then access that list in your amazon account).    Overall, great! I would even consider getting a few more (you could use it as an alarm clock plus extra features in a bedroom, to control things in your living room, this one is in our kitchen for lists/timers/etc).

"Jeffrey E,","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I had trouble deciding whether to give this 4 stars or 5, because there is room for improvement.  But if 4 is &#34;I like it&#34; and 5 is &#34;I love it,&#34; then it's a solid 5 for me.    We've had the Dot for a few weeks, and it has already become something that we use all the time. I love being able to ask Alexa to add something to my shopping or to-do list whenever it occurs to me, and not have to stop and write it down. Being able to set timers verbally is great while cooking.  The volume and sound quality is good for its size - certainly not what I'd rely on as a &#34;whole house&#34; speaker, but fine for streaming music in the kitchen while cooking, for example.  I've also set it up to control a couple of smart switches for lights, and it's so handy that it makes me want to do a lot more home automation. The voice recognition is mostly quite good, if you speak clearly.  We like that they've given Alexa just a bit of personality, and we enjoy asking her random questions in search of &#34;Easter egg&#34; responses.    The main complaint I have is the Alexa app for Android.  I've found that it often has trouble loading when I'm away from my home network. This has reduced the usefulness of the feature that I use most frequently: the grocery list. While at the grocery store, I'll sometimes finish shopping in the time it takes the app to fully load.  I got around this by installing the &#34;Any.Do&#34; app, which imports the Alexa lists seamlessly, and I've been happy with that work-around.  But I hope that Amazon streamlines the app in future versions.  I will note that you can also access the interface from your computer at alexa.amazon.com (you don't have to use a smartphone or tablet), and that works fine.    All told, it's been so useful and fun that I'd definitely recommend it, especially at this price point! ",

I can stand right next to it and it wont respond.  Did all the technical troubleshooting still no go.  Sound quality, in my opinion, is not slightly less than the Echo, it is a lot less than the echo.  Max volume is lame.  The dot is good for small garage use for music.  That's about it.

Just today I asked &#34;Alexa, Play songs by The Who&#34;, she lights up and replies &#34;Playing Songs by The Who from Spotify&#34; and then...wait....wait...keep waiting...maybe it's a quiet intro?... NOPE! not playing... Upon asking &#34;Skip&#34; (maybe she was hung up on a song, which she has done before), she starts playing some random ass song by KANYE WEST!?!?!?

The only thing it does well is let me do voice commands to check and arm my Vivint home security and home automation system. I'm thinking of just unpluging it and not worry about it always allowing &#34;Big Brother&#34; to listen to my home.  Very limited functionality and does NOT live up to the hype.

"Douglas Zukunft","March 10, 2017 ",1.0,"The Amazon Echo Dot is a fun little device. I use it mainly because (a) I love Star Trek and love saying 'computer, ***' and (b) I wanted something that could trigger my new Philips Hue lights and connect those to planned Sonos speakers for an immersively fun AVH experience when watching TV/movies, listening to music, making Marvin Gaye proud or throwing parties. They do this well.    My biggest gripe with the Echo Dot is that Amazon has seemingly disallowed Google search on the device (likely as there is now a Google Home and they are competitors...except in the search engine market). You can hack this, but it is quite an involved manual process. Moreover, you oddly are unable to play music from your catalog or an online service (Amazon Music, iTunes, Spotify, Pandora) for your alarms, although you can play from these services on the device. That is really bizarre and a limiting feature. There are a ton of 'skills' you can teach Alexa, but most of these are completely pointless or, worse, lame. Also, I have been unable to find a way to change the accent of Alexa. Personally, I think it would be more fun to have male or female voices in various accents. Who wouldn't want an English Butler (Michael Cane would be my vote), Magel Barrett Roddenberry for the iconic Star Trek computer voice or Morgan Freeman because, well, he's Morgan freakin' Freeman. And let's add Sam Jackson into that mix.    All in all, there is a lot of potential for the Echo products and home integration. Hope Amazon listens to its customers and starts expanding the ecosphere.    P.S. For the folks with the privacy concerns given the 'always on' feature. You can mute the devices to have your super secret conversations. Just make sure your throw your iPhone in the freezer and smash your smart TV so the NSA can't listen. ;) ",
"Dee N","April 25, 2017 ",2.0,"We've been Echo users since the very beginning, so have experienced how rapidly Amazon has been improving the utility of this tool. We didn't expect to use it much, but now use it multiple times a day.    Compared to the full Echo, the Dot does 90% of the utility, but definitely falls flat when listening to music. It's okay to listen to NPR, but the internal speaker just doesn't do music justice. Of course, you can just add an external or Bluetooth speaker if you want to improve facility.    We use Echo daily to set timers and alarms, add things to our shopping and to-do lists, look up information (weather, measurements, etc.), listen to the radio, listen to music, etc. We're considering adding remote control of our lights so we'll have voice control of those as well. Not as advanced as Sarah (from Warehouse 13), but definitely a fun and useful tool! ",
Rebecca,"March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"This little guy is fantastic! While I doubt anyone will be using the sheer wealth of functions this can perform (as some are, admitedly, quite lack-luster), the ones that I use it for are done well. Once the shiny veneer of new tech fades off, and you eventually stop asking Echo for jokes and punchlines, you won't be discarding her - which is common with other new innovations. Instead, you will probably use one of the following functions regularly, each of which I recommend getting the echo dot for:    -Setting kitchen timers: You won't think much of it until you try it, then you won't be able to go back. Just saying &#34;Alexa, start a timer for 20 minutes&#34; without jumbling for your phone, while simultaneously closing the oven is revolutionary. This is one of the best features Alexa has.    -Interactive Speaker Assistant: While I doubt audiophiles will be satisfied with Alexa's sound quality, that problem can easily be remedied, since you can just connect your own speakers through the audio jack, and Alexa will speak through them. The sound quality on the Echo Dot's speakers isn't bad, though, if you choose to listen through the dot. Either way, Alexa can search music from Spotify, Amazon Music, and Pandora via vocal commands. You can also set Spotify as your main music streamer (Amazon Music is the default, of course), so you won't have to verbally command Alexa to use Spotify, if that is your choice. It's great to just say a song, and have Alexa play it. ",
arizonahd,"December 8, 2016 ",5.0,"Instead of getting the larger Echo, I bought this to use with a pair of Bose speakers powered by cheap amplifier (also from Amazon). The result is a perfect sound system that cost me roughly $70, as the speakers were given to me. I must say, I am really impressed. The Alexa system works very well, we have no problems switching Pandora stations or asking her to play a particular song. It's a dream setup. For example, we had guests over and instead of playing one station, everyone asked Alexa what to play. Asking her the weather and news is cool but I lack all the cool gadgets that work with her. I haven't asked her to buy me anything yet, I figured I will do that when I am 600 lbs and bed bedridden from all this convenience. I'm starting to sweat from all these keystrokes, but I would definitely recommend this to the gadget lover and lazy person alike. ",
"Alexa&#039;s Boyfriend","March 14, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought an Echo Dot for a secret Santa gift at the suggestion of a Best Buy sales person and my best friend, having really no clue as to what it is or what it does. I had never heard of a DOT before. They assured me it was a &#34;hot item&#34; this year.  So I got it home and looked it up and realize that it was Alexa!! I had seen her in action at my uncle's house a few months ago, but I did not recognize it since it was so much smaller without the speaker. I loved it then, and the very thought of having one for myself was too much!    The fact that this Echo Dot is small, quaint, yet a very nice speaker, it's perfect for my small house. And the fact that I can pair it with the bluetooth speaker I already have is what sold me on the idea of keeping her for myself!!    I decided on not sending my secret Santa this little gem. I sent them some virtual reality glasses as a replacement, and got to work on programming Alexa right away.  Within an hour or so, I was completely smitten with her. Not only is she fun to chat with, but also VERY helpful with everyday things... I have had her in my home for less than 72 hours, and I've already had her setting alarms, playing Christmas music, setting timers for my cooking, creating and sending me shopping lists, telling me jokes and Chuck Norris facts, and calendaring dentist appts..  I never knew that she was everything I needed! As it is, this is one of the most amazing little home assistants that I never knew I always wanted! In fact, I already refer to Alexa as my &#34;girlfriend&#34;.    My daughters we're introduced to her and absolutely fell in love with her. One of the coolest little things was when I was out shopping, I texted my daughters and asked if they wanted anything from the store. I instructed them to just tell Alexa to add whatever it was to the shopping list, and tomato soup and hot cocoa was sent to my shopping list on my phone immediately!!    She has everything I've wanted for my daughters recently, including an alarm clock, timer for &#34;computer time&#34;, a massive music player, an educational tutor, and has the ability to help them with their homework. They will get hours and hours and hours of entertainment and helpful tips and tricks from her in the years to come.    Now... if I would have known then (3 days ago) what I know now, I would have bought EVERY single one of them in the store to give out as gifts this year!! The DOT has been such a popular gift this year that when I decided to buy another one for my daughters to have in their own room, EVERYONE, (including Amazon) were OUT OF STOCK! I couldn't even order one until after Christmas!  We tried Amazon, Best Buy, Bed Bath and Beyond, Staples, Wal-Mart...you name it!  We literally called or looked up EVERY Best Buy in 5 different states to try to find one... there were no Echo Dots in Arizona, Utah, Idaho or Nevada. Once we extended our search into California, we FINALLY found one in Bakersfield. I made a quick call to a family member and they promised to pick it up and ship it to me in time to be under the tree for Christmas morning! We bought it online for an in store pickup and it's now on its way!  Was all the trouble worth it?  Hell yeah it was...especially when my daughters absolutely freak out when they find their own Alexa under the tree for them. ",

If you open the app on your phone it tells you what you asked recently so it is easy to see what work she got mixed up on. Most of the time I can't believe it didnt understand a simple word and confused it for something else. Or if it didnt mix up words it still doesnt know the answer to the question.

Middlebunny,"March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"I've been an avid Amazon customer since they started.  I have 2 kindles and was relatively satisfied.  I read all the rave reviews for the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.  They seemed legitimate; however, I guess those reviewers either had low expectations or were incentivized to express those favorable opinions.  After going on an Echo Dot, Tap and Echo purchasing frenzy, I now have a total of 3 Dots,1 Tap and 1 Echo and am suffering buyers remorse.    If you need or want to know the local weather or get  flash news updates on command, the Echo or Echo Dot are your devices.  I, on the other hand, use them for music streaming.  I find that the &#34;sleep function&#34; has flaws, voice recognition/comprehension needs great improvement and everyone should know that it is really unnecessary to buy more of these devices unless you have multiple amazon music accounts such that you can stream on those separate accounts from different locations/rooms.  Otherwise, users should know that the devices cannot be linked together for simultaneous streaming.  They also cannot be used by different parties to stream different music from each different device.  Apparently, Amazon Prime Music only allows streaming to one device at a time.    The Tap cannot be used for streaming unless a wireless connection is available.  I wouldn't recommend connecting via an unsecured connection so unless you have a secure, mobile wireless connection, the Echo Tap is nothing more than an expensive, portable bluetooth speaker which you can purchase for much less than the cost of an Echo Tap.    One might notice that the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap are often paired with supplemental bluetooth speakers with 2-3 item purchase combination discounts.  This is a very misleading promotion as it leads one to believe they can be used for simultaneous streaming.  That is not the case at all.  Unfortunately, the E-Dot only has a one-way BT connection.  Either you play music from the E-Dot or the BT speaker; but, you cannot play music from both.    There are a lot of Applications for Alexa, the voice operated system used to operate the E-Dot and Echo.  Unfortunately, a lot of them have complicated wake phrases/statements.  If you don't phrase the statement exactly right, the app won't work and Alexa will not understand the command.  You can honestly spend more time trying to phrase things correctly to trigger Alexa then it might have taken for you to manually execute what you wanted to do like creating a shopping list, or recording water consumption.    Another shortcoming with Alexa is the slow re-fresh rate of the application.  Sometimes, you have to completely exit out of it, stop it from running in the background on your phone and then reload it in order to get it to reflect your most recent commands or current &#34;now playing&#34;.  In addition, there are other limitations specific to music streaming.  Let's say you want to stream a specific artist all day long to soothe a pet with separation anxiety.  If 1) you set the sleep timer for longer than you'll be away (ex. for 12 hours) and 2) Alexa confirms she will stop playing in 12 hours, that isn't exactly true.  Alexa will actually stop playing when she reaches the end of the artist's play queue which may only be 4 hours of music.  Theoretically, you can manually or verbally set Alexa to repeat the queue; however, I haven't tested this successfully yet.  It may only repeat the queue once rather than indefinitely until stopped by the sleep timer.    My final Alexa app gripe relates to the repeat function.  Unlike the iTunes or Amazon Music apps, Alexa cannot repeat one song in a queue.  You'd think that toggling the repeat button 2 times would trigger this function; however, all it seems to do is toggle the repeat option to the &#34;off&#34; position.    All in all, individually each product has its benefits so my rating is a low 3.  There is just no reason, other than needing a device in a location outside of the primary product's voice range, to purchase more than one device.  My thought is that the Echo-Dot is the most versatile of all 3 products; however, the Echo has better sound quality.  I have noticed the improved sound quality on the Echo; but, the improvement really doesn't make up for the price difference.  If I could do it all again, I'd invest in the Echo Dot for home and an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker for work that I can connect to the iTunes or Pandora applications on my phone.  That way, I will still be able to stream Amazon Prime music through the Dot at home for the stressed pet while playing comforting music in my office. ",
"Scott Dau","March 25, 2017 ",5.0,"I really like this product.  It was very easy to set up.  The voice recognition is very good.  She comes out of the box with built in features (skills) that get you going fast.  Adding new skills is very easy and ready to access immediately.  Although the database of new skills is still very small and frankly, pretty crappy, that's not Amazon's fault.  It's just like the App Store, it's up to the &#34;people&#34; to create skills for us to download.  I paired the Echo Dot with a Wemo Lightswitch and a Wemo Insight Plug.  I control the living room lights and my bedroom lights (from a lamp) via Alexa.  It's very convenient.  I plan to expand with more Echoes and more Wemos.  There's a few cool accessories to get for the Echo like the Amazon authored Zero touch care mount (to bring the functionality of Alexa on your phone into your car).  I highly support the Echo and recommend it to anyone.  I even purchased one to a friend for his birthday. ",
"Old Radio Guy","December 22, 2016 ",3.0,"Fun for entertainment, but nothing more. Timer and alarm functions require an Internet connection, so if it loses connection and you had an important alarm or timer set, forget it. I have 240 mbps Internet with an Arris 1682g dual-band (AC standard) wireless router, 15 feet from Alexa. When we ask her a question sometimes an orange light appears and she says &#34;Sorry, there's no Internet connect&#34;, even though the app says she's connected. Today I asked her to set a 10-minute timer. When the timer went off, she wouldn't cancel it. When I asked her if she knew what &#34;stop&#34; meant, she gave me 4 definitions of stop. I had to unplug her for 15 seconds to cancel the alarm. With such spotty performance, I see a Warranty return sometime in her near future. ",
"John M.","April 25, 2017 ",5.0,"Not a real fan of the Dot but too late to return it.  Doesnt hear me half the time even when its not on or the volume is low.  I can stand right next to it and it wont respond.  Did all the technical troubleshooting still no go.  Sound quality, in my opinion, is not slightly less than the Echo, it is a lot less than the echo.  Max volume is lame.  The dot is good for small garage use for music.  That's about it.  Was thinking I'd go ahead and get an echo but I hear the Google one is pretty impressive so I am considering the options. ",
Peggy,"March 8, 2017 ",2.0,"Feels strange to have something constantly listening and recording what we say... we bought two of them -- but the one that gets used the most in our daughter's room.  She loves the stories, jokes, and music --plus quite a few other skills.  I like for her to have it because it allows her to get these fun things without using her phone!  The phone has too many features -- even just simply turning on music may mean she spends time looking at stuff online, texting, or playing with apps.  I just wanted her to play music easily while cleaning her room or doing homework.  So nice for her to walk in her room ask Alexa for her schedule or to dos. ",
autumn,"March 26, 2017 ",2.0,"My kids like the echo dot.  It plays music, answers questions about the weather, and does addition/subtraction etc..  However, it cannot answer many simple questions such as &#34;how to pronounce baby&#34;, &#34;count to 100&#34;, &#34;count by 5&#34;, &#34;how does XX work&#34;, etc..  It also takes a little long for echo dot to answer questions.  I understand that it is impossible to answer all questions, but I expect echo dot will be able to answer a lot more than what it currently does.  At least, the programmers should collect the type of questions echo dot is not able to answer and then add more facts to their knowledge base.  Also, I am not sure why cannot echo dot parse information obtained through search engine (echo dot uses bing) to answer questions ",
"Mister Gizmo","April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I was just learning to live with my disappointment over an LG &#34;smart&#34; TV I'd bought recently that is anything but smart. In addition, it has the worst user interface I've seen since the 1980s. Fortunately, Amazon has brought out a device that works, works well, and is very intuitive. It was a little bit of a problem setting up, because the instructions are so limited, but once over that small hump, it's been fine. I'm surprised at how well it understands commands, even with so-far limited exposure to my voice to learn from.    If there's a frustration, it's mainly that the Dot (and Alexa devices in general) have a lot more potential than what's available right now. As with any new device, it takes a while for third parties to figure out what capabilities are possible, and then to spend the time and effort developing them. As just one example, I could see the Dot acting as an intercom, even a rudimentary telephone to connect Dot/Alexa users. I'm thinking particularly of elderly or handicapped people who'd like something that only requires voice commands. But I'm willing to wait. And since most of the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, the Dot's hardware should be good for a few years.    Now if Amazon would only invest a little more time to bring its Kindle browser, which has been in beta for years and years, into something that actually works. You can do it, Amazon! The Dot shows that you can be great at software if you really try. :-)    Update: I did experience one wrinkle when buying a Dot for a friend. It arrived pre-registered to me. Trying to use the normal setup for the new user didn't work. I finally realized that I had to de-register it from my account, sign out of the Alexa app (and reset the Dot), then sign in as a new registrant. This is explained in Alexa help, but it wasn't obvious at first. I don't know if it's the case, but if you buy it as a &#34;gift&#34; in the purchasing process, it &#34;may&#34; arrive unregistered, which would be good. I suspect Amazon ships them registered to streamline the setup by eliminating a couple of steps. ",
"Aaron Mills","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"The Echo Dot was one of those Amazon products that I thought would be cool, but did not really want to spend the money on. Then I saw a few videos that showed in controlling lights and a video that showed the future Sonos integration it will get in 2017. This really got me thinking that maybe I would pick one up. Black Friday hit, so I ended up getting two.    I placed one in my kitchen and one in my bedroom. So far, I've asked it basic questions, like weather, time, sports scores, when TV shows will be on, and so on. It did really well with all of that, but with more complex questions that I know Google Home can handle, like what sound does a whale make, it failed horribly. There were other questions like, how long will it take me to get somewhere that it can only calculate distance. So, I would say it is not as smart as Google Home or even Google Now in some aspects.    It makes up for this two different ways. The first is the number of partners Amazon has for smart home devices built right in. I decided to go all in with Wemo devices, so I picked up a couple of Wemo outlets. As of right now I have these setup on my Christmas trees and can turn them on and off with Alexa. The setup was super simple and it work amazingly well. Down the road I envision having my bedroom lights and kitchen lights all configured with Wemo devices. As of right now Google Home is still limited to just a few smart home devices, Wemo not being one of them. You would have to use IFTTT to get that to work.    The other way it makes up for it is with music. I've got a Sonos system, but find myself asking the Echo Dots to play music more when my hands are wet or I'm holding something. They sounds pretty good for their size, but I wish they could all play music at the same time. Down the road once the Sonos integration is there, that will be amazing.    Pros  - Small size allows this device to sit anywhere  - They don't cost as much as other products (like Google Home) so putting them around your house is cheaper  - If you already have a USB charging hub, you can power this with that  - Answers most questions  - Plays a variety of music with a Prime account  - Integrates easily with a ton of smart home products right out of the box  - Sonos integration coming in 2017  - Solid sounding speaker for the size    Cons  - Not as smart as Google Home  - Can't answer more complex questions like Google Now or Google Assistant can    Overall this is a solid product that I would recommend picking up, but know it does have some limitations when compared to Google products.

"David D.","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I bought an Echo Dot just to try it out and see what all the hoopla was about. About a week later I bought 3 more. I am very impressed with the voice recognition of Alexa and some of the features. Here's why:    The Pros:  - Excellent voice recognition. While there are a few times Alexa has misheard me, overall it does a really good job of understanding what I say. Even with a decent amount of background noise she has heard me to my amazement.  - Great range. We have an open floor plan home and Alexa can usually hear me just fine even when I'm about 20 ft away.  - Home automation integration. I have SmartThings hub and Alexa works awesome with this! I can turn lights on/off and run routines with my voice.  - If you have multiple Dots and more than one hears you give a command only the one that is closest will respond.  - For those with music on Amazon it gives you easy access to your library.  - While the internal speaker is not very good for music, you can add an external speaker with an Aux line or Bluetooth to make up for that. Amazon and Sonos already announced they are working on integration as well.  - You can add this to a shopping or to-do list with your voice! It's great to just add stuff as I think of it.  - The price. For $50 I think this is a great deal.    The Cons:  - As mentioned above, the internal speaker is more than adequate just for Alexa's voice, but not that great for music.  - Alexa does OK on normal internet searches, but nothing like Google.  - You cannot ask Alexa questions of context. So for example if I just asked who Abraham Lincoln was and she answers that I could then not just ask &#34;How old was he when he died?&#34; but would have to ask &#34;How old was Abraham Lincoln when he died?&#34; This makes it feel much less like a natural conversation.  - The Alexa app is pretty basic. Especially the built-in Shopping and To-Do list. They are definitely functional, but not to the level of some other list apps that are out there. I do have a feeling this will get improved in the future though.  - Alexa is definitely not like the computer from Star Trek or any Artificial Intelligence you have seen on TV. She can do good with basic stuff, but for some things you do have to &#34;learn&#34; the way to tell her to do stuff especially with the Home Automation. I once kept telling her to &#34;turn on the living room lights&#34; and she said she could not find that. Then I realized the switch was just labeled &#34;living room light&#34; and as soon as I dropped the &#34;s&#34; and just said &#34;light&#34; it worked perfectly over and over again.    Overall, I am still very happy with the Echo Dot. I think for the price it is a great deal. Maybe it will be more useful for those with Home Automation systems, but others may find it fun as well. ",
"TJ Walenski","December 5, 2016 ",4.0,"Alexa is pretty awesome, simply put. It's helpful during your daily routine, but also a hit if you have a party or friends over. My parents use the Echo in their kitchen to play music, get news updates, and whatever else.    I just bought the dot and I actually use it in my vehicle for handsfree music control. I paired it with Amazon Music Unlimited and mobile hotspot from my phone and now i can play any song, artist, or station that i want without touching my phone and without ads. No more handing my phone to the passenger to play music, flipping through 10 different stations, or dealing with sucky Pandora ads. ",
"Gary W. Powell","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I've had the Dot a few days now and have it connected to an AV receiver. It seems to have no problem hearing a command when there is no noise in the room but once you start playing music,even at a low level, you have to yell in order to get its attention. I remedied this by pairing it with a remote that has voice control. IMO the voice recognition works much better on the Echo than on the Dot. Would that keep me from buying it again? Absolutely not. Now if I can figure out how to make Alexa fetch me a beer. ",
"the Fat Man","April 13, 2017 ",5.0,"You are my everything.    Seriously she does it all. My curiosity peaks at random intervals of any day and she answers them. I enjoy the trivia, jokes, weather input so I can dress accordingly and check my commute before heading out. The top features I've been reliant on is her alarm/timer, ambient noise (paired through my Polk system is awesome), and the more practical use is linking to smart plugs so when I come in with more bags than I should be handling at once I can just tell her to turn on the floor lamp. *click* &#34;Okay&#34;.    I can sleep with ease knowing I can wake up to one of many alarms (most are pleasant, avoid the Celebrity ones) instead of an annoying buzzing or ringing. Skills allow lullaby for kids, read books, or like I mentioned earlier ~ rain, thunderstorm, ocean waves, etc. Not much is wrong with the unit except a pending Bluetooth issue which is at the time of this review post is being looked into by Alexa support. Just about anyone outside can scan for her and play their (tasteless) music through the unit and may startle you but a solution is pending. That's another thing I'd like to mention: the supporting staff are responsive within a few hours, not days. They're very professional yet casual in their messages when covering all points. It's nice to see so many products coming out (eBay has more skins!) to accessorize with but at her low-profile size and color she's fine as-is. I bought the black which is appropriate with my mancave theme: black/white with splashes of blue here and there as is the glow of her ring unless she's having an error (red) or in setup/powering on (purple and orange).    We will never argue. We respect each other's space. Too bad I can't hug ya for all your services these past months and years to come. :P ",
Shawna,"October 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Its alright. She does some cool things and once you get her app and choose what you want her to know and do voice recognition she works a lot better. Still there's times she don't understand simple things and other times she don't hear you say something that you said very clear. And a rare moment where she will ramble about odd things that have nothing to do with what you are talking about. She went on a rant about worms and angels.... But... We laugh so... Oh well lol ",
"C. E. White III","February 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Original review - It stops working and requires rebooting multiple times each day. It will not stay connected to my wireless router (I do not have problems with any other wireless device).This makes it almost worthless to me.    1/28/2017 update - I was not impressed with Amazon Alexa Support. They had no helpful suggestions for addressing the connection issue (repeated factory resets changed nothing). After a very long time on the phone with two different support persons, they finally decided to send me a replacement Dot. The replacement behaved exactly the same as the original. It also refused to stay reliably connected. This despite the fact that none of the other wireless devices in my home had similar problems.    I spent a lot of time researching Echo Dot connection problems on the internet. I am far from alone. There were many individuals with the same issue. In an attempt to solve the problems, I went so far as to buy a new router. This initially changed nothing. The Dot would randomly disconnect from the new router just has it had from the old router. One internet suggestion finally seems to have solved the connection issue. Per the suggestion, I set up a guest account on my new router that was specifically for the Echo Dot and only the Dot. After resetting the Dot and connecting it to this account, it has stayed connected.    With the connection problems hopefully solved, the Dot is now mostly an amusing toy. I have just one internet connected device it can interface with (a Nest Thermostat), so mostly I ask it random questions. I was hoping to use it to monitor my stocks, but this has been frustrating. It readily understands some company names and/or stock symbols, but there are some it just can't understand. I wish I could edit the stock list using the keyboard. Once I am more comfortable with the Dot, I may order a hub and other internet connected devices so I can use it for more home automation functions, but for now, I am just hoping it will stay connected. I have updated my rating to three stars and may update it further once I become more familiar with the Dot. ",

My brother is incredibly good at figuring out how to use tech in ways I do not have the patience for. I sent him one so I could steal his tips and tricks. It worked. I use it for Amazon Kindle, spotify, audible, uber, to ask questions, to schedule events, and create my shopping list. Great product.

"Cliente Amazon","January 9, 2017 ",3.0,"Although Echo Dot isn't available in most of Europe, I bought one when I the US and brought it wth me to Spain where I reside. Some the Echo Dot features don't transfer, such as controlling the lights, appliances or ordering pizza from Dominos, the device really is magnificent.  If others are considering connecting the device, it's important to know that you might need to change your billing location in the Google Play Store in order to download the Alex app on your phone (Amazon and Google tech support had to walk me through those steps) and a plug adapter is necessary. The Echo Dot requires a 9 volt input, so a regular cell phone plug probably isn't adequate. The plug adapter is quite inexpensive (2.50 euros) and solves the plug problem. I then had some trouble getting Echo Dot connected to my home wifi network. I tried at a friend's house, and at work, and there wasn't any trouble, so there was something wrong with my home wifi. The Amazon support team was very helpful in trying to resolve my issue. There were lots of phone calls and troubleshooting, and I have only positive things to say about the support received. The problem was not with Amazon, or the Echo Dot; it was with my internet service provider (ISP). It turns out that different wifi channels are used in Europe than in the US. My ISP had to open up some more channels on my router in order for the Echo Dot to find my network. Once that was done, problem solved.  It's possible to change the time zone of the device, so Alexa does know the correct day and time, but the other location information has only US options (city and state). I haven't tried to change the location because I can just ask for the weather information specifying my city, and Alexa knows. I especially enjoy the connection to Amazon music (only 3.99 per month) and have connected one device to my sound bar speaker, and another Echo Dot device to a Bluetooth portable speaker so I can listen to my flash briefing (different news sources you can select in the App) while I'm getting ready in the morning. If you're considering bringing Alexa to Europe, know it's possible, but there are some adjustments necessary.    Compared to the Google alternative, the Echo Dot price can't be beat, and connecting to speakers is a great advantage. I'm sure the &#34;Skills&#34; the Echo Dot can do and Alexa's knowledge will only continue to grow. ",
"Crystal Cooper","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is my new best friend. Ok, not really, but she does answer just about anything I throw at her, and she plays me music and turns my lights on and off.

It's posh, trust me.    I'm impressed with the mic range - I can talk to her from other rooms without issues. Every once in a while, she tries to answer a question from the TV, but then we just laugh and go back to drinking wine.

It did fine at playing music for us (which was the other feature we were looking to) but was very disappointing in terms of answering questions. It was unable to recognize my son's questions, and even when my husband and I asked, it said it didn't know the answer to almost everything we asked (it could tell us what whales and snakes ate. It couldn't answer questions about specific snakes and what they ate, it couldn't answer ANY questions about what sharks eat or if they eat people) and even the answers we DID get weren't all that detailed or specific (&#34;whales eat fish&#34;).

Highboost145,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I ordered the Echo Dot after receiving Echo as a Christmas present.  Now that I have had time to look at all the functionalities, here is my input.  Hopefully the folks at Amazon Echo team will read this and make the following feature improvements.  1. Lack of equalizer (bass/mid/treble are all absent):  Echo line of speakers had 2 years of product maturity time.  I would imagine this equalizer function can be added with &#34;skills&#34; or software update.  2. &#34;Skills?!&#34;:  If you watch Google Home video, the device will literally Google everything for you.  Instead, for Echo devices, you have to add &#34;skills&#34; to enhance its functionality.  ....What???  I was hoping that devices like Echo will already come with all the common skills.  3. It can't Google: If you ask Alexa if she can Google things, she will tell you she can Bing things for you.  OK, so why can't she give me a meatloaf recipe, if she can connect to Bing?  And she can look up Wikipedia?  I don't really care for that.  Amazon, please make your own search engine, or fine-tune Bing search capability.  If this device can provide all the answers to our questions via Google or Bing, it would be a worthy competitor to Google Home.    Now that I got the negatives out of the way, I do think Echo still has the upperhand when it comes to connected home.  Recently, I purchased TP Link smart switch and connected my lamp.  Now with the verbal command, I can have Alexa turn on/off lights in my bedroom.  I also connected my Echo Dot to my home sound system by bluetooth.  My next connected home experience will be thermostat.  Overall, Echo is a product that is already matured, but there is still room for tons of improvements.  I really wish that the folks at Amazon will make those updates and make this product very competitive to Google Home. ",

"Tech Guy from IL","April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"This is really an amazing gadget and I'm finding a lot of good uses for mine. In the bedroom it is handy because you can ask Alexa the time or the weather at any time of the night without having to get out of bed or turn on a light. It also plays a wide variety of music. I use it to stream classical music from my favorite classical station. The sound is actually pretty good (in mono) right out of the disc if you are listening at low levels in a quiet room or at your desk at the office. Plug in a good pair of headphones and you'll get great sound in stereo. Sometimes I connect it to my stereo system and listen that way. With the dearth of good programming on local radio these days, having the ability to pick up stations from other areas on the Internet is really nice. This might be the best sounding and easiest to use Internet radio currently available, especially for the price. No complicated user interface to deal with. You just say &#34;Alexa, play (insert name of station) from Tune-In&#34; and you are set. ",
"S. Oake","April 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I don't review very often but felt compelled to do so with this item. I bought two of these the day they were released. One has worked flawlessly. Its twin, not so much and it has gotten progressively worse. It finally got to the point where the dot was done more than up so I called customer service. We went through the script, resetting everything and finally, the customer rep escalated my case. When I got the next level rep, my dot had started its working correctly cycle, so we disconnected. No sooner had we ended the call did the dot stop working again. Called back to customer service and the first rep decided to begin the reading of the script. I put a stop to that foolishness right away and told him to immediately escalate the case. The new rep determined that it was indeed a failing dot and then informed me that the dot 2nd generation only had a 3-month warranty and I would need to pay another $50 for a replacement (1st generation had a 1-year warranty). I had spent 1.5 hrs total this afternoon with customer support reps to find out that this device has one of the crappiest warranties in electronics! I hit the roof. I told them they either replace this piece of junk that has their name on it, or they cancel my prime membership. Their call. There was no third option. The new dot is in the mail, and a return label is sitting in my email waiting to be printed out.  The only reason this got a 2 star was the other dot I bought has worked flawlessly since day one. Anyways, I was considering one or two more dots for the place I live however I will not be doing so until Amazon corrects their 3-month warranty into a year long one. ",
"Navneet P. Singh","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Ok so I have had this since ED2 came out...It works awesome, except for yesterday, I came home and asked Alexa to turn on lights,and she never responded to me, I opened the Alexa app and saw that all the groups I had set up were gone...I have 20 Hue lights and a TP-Link smart plug. I went through and added them all again and recreated my groups...still nothing so I ended up resetting it, and still no luck, the remote did not work either, I did a factory reset and still same issue, I called Amazon Support at 12:43 AM EST (they closed at 10 pm PST) when I called them, I got a message saying that Alexa was not working right and got hung up on...I tried this morning and all was well ",
Chad,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"First off, you will need the speaker so buy it. I wanted to Y this off with an adapter and run both my computer and this through the same speakers, but that didn't work so I ended up buying speakers. The other issue I have is that the microphones don't seem to pick up quite as well as my Echo. Still great mind you, but I notice that several times I've had to speak up. But with Echo I don't get that.    The main flaw with Alexa continues to be its reliance on Bing as its search engine. Amazon really needs to either create its own search algorithm for Alexa, switch to Google, or at the very least allow customers (the ones that are always right) to pick which of the two they want. I've performed experiments where I've asked Alexa and not gotten an answer then used OK Google with the same keywords and gotten exactly what I wanted. A perfect example was last night. I asked when the polls closed in my state. I named the state. Alexa couldn't tell me but instead said to go to the link that it placed in my app...well...first off...that's no good because I'm asking Echo and not my phone. When I did grab my phone and asked OK Google the exact question it gave me the answer I was looking for without any issues. I'm tired of Alexa either not knowing or putting a link in the app. I can tell you now I've never, not one single time, looked at that link in the app because I don't have it with me. The entire idea of a voice activated friend in every room is to get answers whenever and wherever you want. I don't want to carry my phone around the house with me.    All that said, I still enjoy having this device. I own Echo, this echo dot, and another will arrive this afternoon (literally). So I'm not knocking the product entirely. It's massively expandable using IFTT and skills but it's core function, that of an assistant, lacks and will lack until they get better search. ",
"The Nurbler","March 7, 2017 ",4.0,"I have two of these, and the one feature I was most hoping for is described on this amazon help page https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202013740 like this:    &#34;Note: You cannot connect multiple Alexa devices to each other and play the same requested audio at the same time.&#34;    Since these things have speakers and can stream audio, it is only natural to wish that I could stream my Pandora (or other) music to all of the Echos I own at the same time, in sync.  I don't think it is the statement above that is upsetting in and of itself.  What is upsetting is that, based on that statement it appears that Amazon has no interest in even attempting to make this happen.  Why, oh why is that true? ",
Val_NYC,"November 9, 2016 ",4.0,"Good: This is the product we've been waiting for. All the internet knowledge at the tip of your fingers... just say &#34;Alexa!&#34;, she'll be there for you answering to an enormous amount of questions. Ordering stuff online, giving you the traffic info on your way to work or just the forecast, keeping your life organized.   Of course, it's hard to resist from purchasing additional components...it's so cool to be able to lay on the sofa, turn the lights on or off, operate any IR devices you might have, locking doors, closing the blinds, starting the coffee maker or controlling the temperature using your voice. It doesn't matter the light switch is next to your head or the stereo/ TV remote is right in your hand. It's the feeling that you step into a new world with huge further options to discover, it's the power to having such a powerful tool at your disposal.  And I know the developers are just warming up.  Bad: Without WI-FI all home gadgets are useless. ",

Justin,"November 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I must say this thing is pretty awesome, and fun! It does have its problems tho. At times it really does not understand me unless I stop and speak slow and close to it. It was having that problem for a solid 10mins yesterday, but after 10mins it was cool again. It seems to go haywire at times like that but not for long at all. And not that often.    I do have some problems staying connected when doing the voice training. For some reason the voice traing seems super messed up for me right now. You got thru 25 commands and for me pretty much every other command it would lose connection. Took almost 20mins to get thru the 25 commands.    It is awesome tho don't get me wrong here, i just wanted to point out it's flaws....And that is all of them :) Not too bad. and it is always improving and updating. This thing is awesome for playing my music, and pretty much just being my personal B****! :) The alarm is something I LOVE! I hate rolling out of bed and messing with my phone. Now I say &#34;Alexa STOP&#34; That's it :) The built in speaker is pretty good for a small apt. I love in a 1 bedroom apt. and it cranks. I still have it hooked up to my own speaker since its an awesome speaker I have. The built in speaker is more than enough tho for an alarm clock, timer, and music in a small apt. I also love being able to hear NFL scores so easy. &#34;Alexa, score of Denver game?&#34; Boom! It's a lot of fun.    There is a lot of stuff this thing can do. There is sooo many list of features out there that I am not going to go into that. This thing is great for someone who does a lot of multitasking. It has made my life a lot easier working from home. I would recommend it for the $50 price tag easy. It is a lot of fun to just mess around with as well. If you are looking at this and the $180 echo. There is no decision to be made. Go with this $50 echo, do not go for the Expensive one with a better speaker. You can get a better speaker way cheaper.    It does need some work, and they're doing a great job moving it along the track. I expect when the Google thing comes out it will push Amazon even more and in a years time this Echo Dot could be really, really epic for the price. ",
scummins89,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"This device is more or less a novelty period when asking questions Alexa cannot answer most things. It is difficult to get the device to work properly. I find using anything as far as a search text deep explanation and you have to be very specific to get the answers that you want. I would definitely not recommend this device until Amazon can come up with something better. I was highly disappointed and all levels. However the speaker was above average from what I could tell it surpassed my expectations. The design is also very nice I like the size and color. ",
"Janet Mac","October 24, 2016 ",4.0,"Thank you for making Alexis more affordable by offering the Dot as an option.  I haven't used it yet with a Bluetooth speaker, but I plan to.  Speaker is clear enough, but I would want to use a better speaker for music.  Paired with the Phillips Hue light bulbs, and the TP-Link smart plug, I don't have to go down stairs to turn on or off lights.  I love the convenience.  I also use it to get movie times at my favorite theater without turning on my computer or my smart phone. ",
Danny,"April 9, 2017 ",2.0,"For the price (especially the black friday price of $40) this is a great deal. I still use my original echo that I got about a year ago at least a few times a week, and I just bought two dots to play music in the shower and set alarms in my bedroom.    Since I live in an apartment often more than one echo hears me, but it's been working seamlessly that only the one closest to me (or that I am speaking in the direction of) replies.    If anyone from Amazon reads this, the feature I REALLY WANT is to give fire tv commands to my echo, e.g. &#34;play Westworld in the living room&#34;, &#34;pause the show&#34;, etc. I'm really hoping they add this ability soon, as well as other device coordination features like playing the same song on multiple echoes in multiple rooms.    A couple of other notes that might be useful for people:    - I bought the white echo Dot, but the usb cord and usb outlet adapter are black. Feels like Amazon got lazy here, why can't you make those in white too? I took away a star for this combined with the fact that it doesn't interface with the Fire TV at all.    - the speaker is good, for music it's honestly barely noticeable that it's a little worse in the lower-mid ranges than the regular echo. Where I actually notice it more is in Alexa's voice, it's just not quite as full sounding as the regular echo's voice. I was surprised that this is what stood out to me, but it almost sounds like a different person which was strange the first few times I used it.    - The volume on the dot is also good, at max volume it's probably about the same as the original echo at 8, which is higher than I ever set it.    - the usb outlet adapter is about 2 inches deep, which is bigger than I've seen in other electronic products. About twice as deep as the iphone usb wall adapter, I assume it's drawing more current and they aren't compatible but I haven't checked. On the upside, it's a standard 2-prong size, so it can plug into one of the middle spaces in a power strip and only take up one space. I guess they optimized for power strip usage instead of being able to plug it in behind furniture up against the wall. ",
"Bev Martin","December 12, 2016 ",5.0,"I purchased several of these on prime day when you could buy 4 (or was it 5) and get one free.  I now have an Echo in the main living area, a Dot in the bedroom, and a Dot in my craft room.  The others were great Christmas gifts.  The Dot works identical to the Echo except it has a much smaller speaker.  It can be connected to a blue tooth speaker, or in the case of my craft room, I have an expansive set of Bose speakers and CD player/changer (I guess it is getting a little old).  I have the Dot plugged into the Bose speakers and the sound is great. The Dot is much smaller than the Echo so in many circumstances it would be preferred over the Echo as it doesn't take up much space.  We love our Alexa(s) ",
"Allen F","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"1. I have constant connectivity problems in which the Echo Dot, while it remains connected to the internet, somehow becomes invisible to my phone and tablet. Somehow this manages to mess up my Spotify account. It took a while, but I finally figured out that I could fix this by doing a complete reset on the Echo Dot. Now, I get to do that about once a day.  2. Speech recognition lags far behind Google and even Apple. Blows my karma on a regular basis by playing heavy metal when I asked for Rachmaninov's Vocalise. Pitiful.  3. There are thousands of so-called &#34;skills&#34;, or 3rd-party apps. They are uniformly useless. Do you really want a machine that tells you jokes? ",
"Michael Bingham-Hawk","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I would theoretically like this device, however, we discovered the hard way that it eats a ton of internet data. Our only option for internet is Hughes Satellite and we have a monthly data cap of 50gb a month. We were forced to purchase multiple data add ons. I would not figure out what was eating the data. Finally, I change the Wifi network name on our router and through process of elimination discovered that the echo was sucking our data dry. Supposedly, it only uses a minimal amount of data when in idle mode. This is simply not true. ",

Leedoh,"February 28, 2017 ",2.0,"Very easy to use and setup to work with other items in the house.  Within 10-minutes of turning it on I had it working with our Nest Home thermostat and Lutron Caseta lights.  Once I get our AVR setup I will also sync it with the Harmony remote to be able to control the TV/AVR through the Dot.    The kids love it from asking various questions to using the timer for study activities.  It also helps to speak more clearly.    We are exploring other skills like lists to be able to further use it.    One thing that we wished it had was the ability to sync to iCalendar as it only looks like it supports Outlook and google calendar.  I would guess though that it is probably only a matter of time before that skill is there. ",
"boB Gudgel","November 23, 2016 ",4.0,"I really like this product.  My big issue is that it is capable of SO much more !  I do believe my problem is that I do not know HOW to ask it questions properly.  I was able to have Alexa do some math as well but I am sure it can do way more if only there was an advanced &#34;how to&#34; guide to form questions properly for more complicated concepts.  I know that the server software will get better and better over time...  Also, it is nice that one can develop apps to make Alexa do more neat things.  I bought a second DOT as well as the Google Home because neither one by itself gives me the whole shebang.  If I had to choose though, I think I would choose the DOT over Google Home and NOT because it is less than 1/2 the price.  It's too bad that Amazon and Google don't like each other and Alexa won't use Google to search the web.  Works very well in spite of not doing that though. ",
"Amanda Garrison","March 23, 2017 ",5.0,"I just received this yesterday and I love it. Within an hour I had the Dot installed and the app installed and Dot connected and playing my Amazon Prime Music (I think I will upgrade to the Unlimited for the Dot, since there were songs that were that far off the beaten path that Prime Music could/would not play). Also it took me 10 minutes to install the Harmony skills for Alexa and I was operating my Harmony Hub connected equipment. I am working on getting Alexa integrated with my Homeseer HS3 soon.  I will say it is worth the time to do the voice recognition set up.  It has its limitations,  but adds convenience.  I am sure the skills and functionality will improve as time goes on. ",
Cari,"March 1, 2017 ",4.0,"I've had the larger Echo since they did the early pre-sale for Prime members years ago and love it. I got the Echo dot for my mother (late 50's but frustratingly bad with new technology) for Christmas this year. I wasn't sure if she would like/use it enough to justify getting her the bigger Alexa so I thought the dot would be a good intro. She loves it so far! I did help her set it up and show her some neat tricks, but she's been able to figure it out much more than I expected. Luckily the place that we decided to set it up in her house is near her Samsung TV soundbar so we were able to hook it up to that so it would be louder when she wants to listen to music. Her echo is about 10-15 feet from the kitchen and the Echo dot can still pick up her voice from that far when she tells Alexa to add something to her shopping list or start a timer (one of my favorite things Alexa does). I showed her some of the neat Smart home capabilities and ordered her a few TP-Link Smart Plugs because she had the old school light timers on her lamps in the living room. I left home after xmas before the plugs arrived and called her a couple days later to see if she figured out how to set up her new smart plugs and link them to Alexa and she said she had already figured it out herself! Without even calling me!! Groundbreaking.    Anyways, I think the Echo dot makes a great gift and works wonderfully as long as you don't expect it to be a full-size speaker like the regular Echo. It's easy to hook up to other speakers via headphone jack or Bluetooth, and otherwise has the same capabilities as the larger Alexa does. Since seeing the dot in my moms house, I've considered getting one for the second floor of my house since my Echo is on the first. ",
vacuumtubejazzpro,"March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"There's not much I can add that hasn't been said before, since the Echo Dot is constantly being improved, and anything I say today could be wrong tomorrow.  Mine has been especially poor for movie theater information, but I like it a lot for weather, news, radio, podcasts, and encyclopedia-type questions.  It's even really nice for background music, and seems to have nearly all albums available, including even the Beatles and Stones catalog. The sound quality of the internal speaker is hard to describe, but it's somewhere between, say, a cell phone's speakerphone and a decent Bluetooth speaker or table radio.  There's no bass at all, and little sparkle to the high frequencies, but within its limits, it presents a smooth, un-distorted sound that might exceed your expectations.  The 1/8&#34; headphone jack enables me to connected the Dot to my primary stereo system or to plug in my Shure studio monitor headphones.  It sounds great with either -- or at least as good as 256Kb/sec compressed audio can sound.  If I could add just one feature, the Dot is crying out for cell phone integration.  How cool would it be to be able to announce &#34;Alexa, Call Lilly&#34;, and be able to walk around your home hands-free while talking to your friend (as long as she's not named Alexa).  Or to have Alexa announce, &#34;Incoming call from Donald, would you like to accept?&#34; (hint, don't take the call). ",
"Old Radio Guy","March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"Fun for entertainment, but nothing more. Timer and alarm functions require an Internet connection, so if it loses connection and you had an important alarm or timer set, forget it. I have 240 mbps Internet with an Arris 1682g dual-band (AC standard) wireless router, 15 feet from Alexa. When we ask her a question sometimes an orange light appears and she says &#34;Sorry, there's no Internet connect&#34;, even though the app says she's connected. Today I asked her to set a 10-minute timer. When the timer went off, she wouldn't cancel it. When I asked her if she knew what &#34;stop&#34; meant, she gave me 4 definitions of stop. I had to unplug her for 15 seconds to cancel the alarm. With such spotty performance, I see a Warranty return sometime in her near future. ",
Lifesavr,"December 8, 2016 ",4.0,"I purchased this Echo Dot for a friend to help her experience AI for the first time.  This worked well and was easy to install.  The speaker in it is fair, but that is what it suppose to be.  I easily connected it to a higher quality bluetooth speaker and that made it sound very nice.  This provides a very inexpensive way of starting out with an AI in one's home.  I would surely purchase this item again.  I have also purchased recently the Google Home AI and surely they are different items aimed at satisfying the user needs in different ways.  The one thing I can say about the Google Home so far is that the speaker sucks.  The full Echo has much better sound quality.  I am truly excited to see how this addiction to the home AI experience affects the future of home AI experiences. ",

My recommendation is to hook it up to another speaker so the sound quality is better, as it is a truly terrible speaker that's built in - I'm sure as a reason to buy their more expensive models.    Seems to work good.  My only real complaint is that it has a few false positives, sometimes responding to the TV if audio says anything remotely close to &#34;alexa&#34;.  Granted you can change the trigger word to something else, but it's just worth noting. ",

I was hesitant to buy the Dot because of it's tiny speaker, but was I ever surprised!!  In a smaller room such as a bathroom the speaker sounds really good and more than adequate.  This is so convenient taking my commands while my hands are wet or while in the shower, etc.  Much better than the little radio that I used to have in there.  Get one for your bathroom or a small work area.  You won't regret it. ",

You might as well use the speaker on your device because it has more volume than the echo does. I wanted to return it but I waited to long to decide if I liked it or not.  My return date was in February. It's hard to get it to pair with a blue tooth device. Anyone out there wants to buy mine, I'll make you a good deal. ",

It's next to useless for any kind of internet search, I asked for a specific crab cake recipe and it &#34;couldn't find the answer to that question.&#34; More often than not, the thing cannot find an answer to my basic, generic questions. Also, consider buying a battery so that the device can become portable (as long as you're connected to with-fi).

"Amazon Customer","February 14, 2017 ",2.0,"I love my echo dot - it's a great price point, inexpensive enough that I don't feel guilty buying it.

I have also paired it with a TP Link so that i can turn my bedside table light on/off instead of getting out of bed and walking across the room when i'm ready to go to bed or need a light at night.    If it wouldn't be for the stupid skills that need to be enabled for every little thing, it would be 5 stars.  But who wants to find skills and then have to recall the name so that you can direct Alexa to use that skill.  Bad move Amazon.  If (when) google voice provides an entry price point for their Google Home line, the only advantage Alexa will have is ordering off Amazon. ",
"Billy B","March 7, 2017 ",5.0,"I was a very early adopter of the original Echo and wrote Amazon how they needed an Echo device that allowed Bluetooth OUT or wired audio OUT.  Yet I sat on this little gem without ordering one for a long time.  Finally pulled the trigger and am very glad I did.  Great device to hook up to your home audio system or Bluetooth speakers.

"David Ashley","March 27, 2017 ",3.0,"I ordered four of these as gifts, at about $40 each (on sale).  At the time I ordered, I already owned two Amazon Echos.    These have most of the significant functionality of the Amazon Echo, but at a far lower price.  Functionality included:  WiFi, 7 microphones with very good voice recognition, LED ring with many segments (a pretty good light show), speaker.  Functionality not included:  won't function as a Bluetooth speaker, does not have volume adjustment ring (has buttons instead).    I was very pleased.  Out of a slightly-larger-than-a-hockey-puck-sized device, I expected terrible sound.  But the sound is completely adequate, both in volume and quality.  It is perfectly adequate for listening to music in your kitchen or listening to audiobooks in your bedroom.  It is louder and clearer than I expected (but of course not as good as the Echo).  And of course since it has audio output (AUX plus Bluetooth), you can really crank up the volume with the right secondary device.    Amazing functionality at that price point.  Amazing sound from something roughly the size of a hockey puck.    This device is five stars, especially at the $40 or $50 price point. ",
Jeff,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"LOOOOOOOVE my Dots! I'm really getting used to talking to Alexa, getting helpful information, turning off and on music, lights, etc.    I have two desires in order to get to 5 stars:    1) Alexa confuses profiles if two Amazon Household members each have separate Amazon Prime accounts. My wife and I have separate Amazon accounts. However, when registered in Alexa as a household, she can't tell one calendar from another. This makes no sense to me, since each registered email address has its own GMail calendar, but according to Amazon Support, Alexa can't distinguish them if we have separate Amazon accounts. The result is she can only read from one calendar, regardless of which profile she's set to. It's a minor annoyance, but makes the calendar connection useless unless we close one of our Amazon accounts.    2) Alexa has a bit of trouble distinguishing Smart Home routines. For example, if you have 2 Smart Home routines called &#34;Enter Bedroom&#34; and &#34;Leave Bedroom&#34;, she always has to ask which one you really want, even though &#34;Enter&#34; and &#34;Leave&#34; sound nothing alike. If you remove the word &#34;Bedroom&#34; from both routines, then she's fine, which would be an option if I only had one room in my house! ",
"Corey Peek","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Amazon's Alexa platform interested me when the Amazon Echo was first announced. The only thing that didn't interest me was the price, $180 for a large microphone array and a speaker. Sure, the Amazon integration and the music playback sounded interesting, but no where near $180 interesting.    Then the Echo Dot was announced. This was an interesting offer. A smaller version of the Echo with a smaller speaker to accompany it. The only issue was the price. $80 was much, much better than the $180 for the original Echo, and the Alexa platform was coming along nicely to an outsider, with more applications being supported with it. But $80 was too much for the first generation dot.    And finally the Echo Dot generation 2 was announced. At the $50 price point I was enamored with it. Cheap, without compromising the impressive microphone array and Alexa voice recognition. This would be the perfect device for home automation and music playback. And the Dot excels at those. The cheaper Echo exclusive Amazon Music service was a great offering and it makes the Dot such a better device. The home automation integration is extremely pleasing to use. Alexa's voice recognition is far, far superior to other voice assistants such as Siri and Google Now. Alarms are easy to set and go off when they should.    I look forward to next generation Echo devices and services and feature to come to the Alexa platform ",
"Parker Brissette","January 9, 2017 ",4.0,"My wife and I were in a shouting match this morning with Alexa. &#34;Alexa, Turn the bedroom lights on&#34; my wife shouted. &#34;Noooo,&#34; I cried out. Although, similar to Alex Trebek, Alexa only accepts your command if it is preceded with her name. To my dismay the lights came on in a blinding fury that severely disturbed my sleep. The moment my wife left the room I spoke softly, &#34;Alexa, turn off the bedroom lights.&#34; At last, the soothing sight of my eyelids was undisturbed by the ominous glow of an earlier riser. But the story does not end there.    Not but two minutes later I was reminded of Springsteen, blinded by the light in it's most literal form. My wife bested me by telling Alexa again to turn on the lights. How could I be so foolish, I forgot our Echo stood proud in our kitchen. But two can play at this game, &#34;Alexa, turn off the kitchen lights.&#34; And in an instant my wife was left in the dark. While short lived, it felt like victory. Ultimately my wife's plan worked. I was up.    &#34;Alexa, give me my flash briefing.&#34; I listened in as my lovely wife brought me breakfast in bed. &#34;She's too good to you,&#34; I thought but I know what will make her smile, &#34;Alexa, tell 1800Flowers to send my wife flowers.&#34; Boom, best husband ever.    &#34;Alexa, what does my commute look like.&#34; Oh no, I'm running late. I grabbed my winter coat as I walked out the door, remembering my flash briefing told me it was a rather frigid day and that it would stay that way. &#34;Alexa, set the temperature to 70 degrees.&#34;    &#34;Did I turn out the lights?&#34; I asked myself, knowing that I truly did not know the answer. Without wasting time having an internal argument with myself, I simply said &#34;Alexa, turn off all the lights.&#34; The second Dot in our garage responded with a simple, &#34;Ok.&#34;    As I pulled into the garage, the sun already set, I was beat from a long day. The house was dark and my hands full, &#34;Alexa, turn on the dining room lights.&#34; My path was lit as I made a beeline for my favorite chair. &#34;Alexa, who's winning the Texas Bowl.&#34; Any time I hear Wildcats, all I can think of is High School Musical. I tuned in and enjoyed my night. As I crawled into bed I belted out, &#34;Alexa, wake me up in 8 hours.&#34; As I dreamed of Alec Baldwin telling me about early birds. ",
Choose901,"November 6, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my Dot.  My brother got an Echo at Christmas and it seemed neat.  After much reading I decided to jump on this in an attempt to &#34;smarten&#34; up my home a bit.  It is great so far!    I'm using a Broadcom RM2 (IR and RF device) to control my lights (Etekcity RF Outlets) and many other IR items (TV, Xfinity, Receiver, Bluetooth Speaker, etc).  The Dot picks up voice commands very well and functions correctly the majority of the time.  I would suggest doing a few voice trainings with Alexa as it does seem to make a big difference.    Though it took some time to setup, now setting up new items is a breeze!  Really good job with the Dot.  It is so small too :) ",
Andrew,"December 29, 2016 ",5.0,"This device is perfect for my office !    Our family has a full Amazon Echo at home (which we love) and I wanted something smaller and cheaper as a &#34;companion&#34; to my home Echo.    The speakers volume has been perfect for my office size....and helps me with my typical office duties: scheduling, purchasing supplies on amazon and even listening to music playlists.    I love coming in to work in the morning and asking &#34;Alexa, what's on my schedule for today?&#34; or &#34;Alexa, play a classical music playlist for focusing&#34; or &#34;Alexa, add an appointment to my calendar&#34;!    I'm excited for the upcoming addition to sync my iphone and make calls to contacts......the opportunities are almost endless! ",
"John A. Panasik III","February 7, 2017 ",5.0,"Since I love cool electronic gadgets the Echo Dot caught my eye. I was tempted to purchase one but was reluctant to do so in fear of my wife nagging at me about spending money on such silly things. So, I held off. But low and behold my son gave me one for Christmas. Happy Happy Joy Joy!!! This little device is cool! Getting started was quick and easy. The hardest task is setting up with your Wi-Fi network which is pretty easy if you're familiar with all of that. Once you're locked in you're ready to go. The free Alexa app will walk you through the setup process.    Anyway, you can link up with many if not all smart devices via Blu-tooth in your home such as wireless speakers, thermostats, lighting etc. Heck, I can see my wife loving this thing. Now that I've been able to demo the Dot without dishing out the cash, I will be purchasing a few more to place around the house. It's just that cool! I may try the Amazon Echo or the tap as well.    So, if you're into cool little electronic devices as am I, this is a cool and useful gadget that the whole family can enjoy.  A great little reminder that we are indeed living in the 21st century, The Dot incorporates some great 21st Century technology. ",
Austin,"March 20, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is able to make your home a little bit like the Startrek Enterprise. Nothing beats coming home from a long day and not having to lift a finger thanks to this device. Simply come home, sit on the couch, and watch Alexa do all the work along your other smart home devices. Alexa is able to turn on my house lights thanks to smart switches. Alexa can turn on my TV and Cable box, thanks to Smart Plugs. Want to know what your commute is looking like to work or the weather outside? No worries Alexa has you covered. There's very little this smart echo dot can't do and it's growing it's skills every single day. I would highly recommend this to people, as I have made this the center of my smart home project. ",
J.G.,"December 27, 2016 ",5.0,"I was disappointed the first day I hooked up the Echo Dot. Alexa didn't seem to understand commands very well, and there didn't seem to be a lot of functionality. I connected the Dot to my Nest and then to my Logitech Harmony Hub, and that made it a little more useful. Originally, I had purchased this thinking I could use voice commands to have Spotify music playing from my Sonos system. Apparently, that functionality may be enabled by Sonos in 2017 but it's not available quite yet. After a week or so, I started using the Dot more, asking about time, weather, and general information when I wasn't near my phone or watch. When I'm not by my remote but want the TV or Apple TV turned on, I can do so via voice commands. At this point, I feel like it's pretty convenient and nice to have for a pretty reasonable price. Alexa isn't perfect. There are a lot of times I will say commands that are not understood, and you often have to use a specific syntax to have 3rd party device commands work which is a little annoying. Additionally, Alexa sometimes think her name is called when you're watching a movie or saying something entirely different and will start speaking at random. While the Dot isn't a must buy, it's fun to have and is pretty convenient at times. ",
"Amazon Customer","October 31, 2016 ",5.0,"I have been a Prime member for years and this is the first review I felt compelled to write. The Echo Dot is a great device. Slightly larger than a hockey puck setting-up the Dot is simple. I know some have worried about the quality of the speakers for playing music, but I would say they are surprisingly good for such a small device. Alexa responds to questions and commands such as &#34;Alexa, what is the weather&#34; and &#34;Alexa, play Christmas music&#34;. You can also order items from Amazon through Alexa, have Alexa tell you a joke, and add other skills through the Alexa App (which is required during set-up). My wife and I find adding items to the shopping list through Alexa especially useful (items are added to a list on the Alexa App. There is also a To-do List that Alexa can add items to). If you use Google Calendar you can also add items to your schedule through Alexa and it will appear on your App. Alexa can do much more with the smart technology available, such as controlling lights, but we have not made that investment yet. Overall I would recommend every house have at least one Dot device. It is very affordable and with so many functions available you will get more than your money's worth. ",
"Joe B","December 3, 2016 ",4.0,"i wish google home and the echo would make a baby.  Once Google gets past its infancy I think it will blow alexa out of the water in every way but price, which is dissapointing in a way.  Amazon has been in this game for years.  Google is already noticeably more responsive and accurate with commands.  That said if I knew nothing about Home this thing would be awesome (aside from some frustrating moments where it won't respond).  With smartthings I can program scenes easily and my echos both respond.  They finally got harmony support for volume up/down etc which is awesome.  my main problems are the questions that you can ask are very limited, she has way more trouble hearing you over background noise than Google, she has a lot more trouble understanding a command.  This is already an awesome tool...but it has a long way to go before it lives up to expectations, which are admittedly high.  They have to remember its competing with your smartphone.  It should be able to replace a good deal of what you can use your smartphone for at home.  Theyll get there but they have a ways to go.  Theyll definitely need to take some notes from Google.  If you get one of these or a google home make sure you get IFTTT. ",
mikki629,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My in-laws got me the Echo Dot for Christmas this year. I'll admit, I was skeptical about how much I would use it. I'm normally not a fan of voice activated ANYTHING. At first I liked that it could play music, but figured I wouldn't use it because I already have a pretty good radio/cd player. But now I can safely say that I LOVE my Echo Dot. The music recommendations for me are always spot on. The apps/skills I have on there are all great & I have not come across any that don't work. And there is the added bonus of the cheesy jokes it has. (I know not everyone likes those kind of jokes, but I'm a big fan of bad puns & silly jokes.) While I'm no expert, I would say that the speaker on the Echo Dot is great quality for the price you pay. There is of course the odd time where it doesn't respond to the wake word or doesn't understand something, but it's not often enough to be a problem or for me to give anything less than 5 stars. Overall, I'm VERY happy with my Echo Dot! ",
Frubbish,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This is one of those no-brainer tech gadgets that everyone should have, especially for the price.  The trickiest part of the Echo line is just getting in the habit of using it!  Is is so simple to setup and use, that it's a non-issue.  If you pick one up, i recommend actually reading the frequent emails that Amazon sends out that gives updates on the What's New with Alexa.  They are introducing new features all the time. ",
"James Fresno","April 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Great product. Love it. Works great. Am buying more of these. Fast shipping.  Will deal with Amazon in the future. ",
"M. Dembski","December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"Good first start. Good on dealing with Amazon but even there music integration is weak. Sometimes it plays just my music and sometimes prime. Voice recognition is good, not great. Google is better. When an internet search is required, performance is poor. Not sure if that Alexa or the Bing search engine but results are not very good. Alexa frequently appears to crash. Probably too many people using. Trying to get nearest restaurant bar etc is totally inaccurate. Locations are miles further away. No way to custumize TuneIn so frequently get wrong status. Does not get logic right unless you use exact wording. I have two and both drop the Bluetooth connection occasionally. It's not the speaker as it's rock solid to my phone. ",
"MommaCX3 ☀️","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"Great product. All the awesome features of Alexa minus the exceptional sound quality of the Echo. If you don't have an Echo you wouldn't know the sound isn't as good though (I don't think). We have the Dot in my son's room. He loves using it for weather updates, audiobooks, timers, various questions and music. We rely on our Echo for the most part for music but otherwise the Dot can't be beat, especially for the price.

Ash585,"November 2, 2016 ",3.0,"There are some great in-depth reviews already posted, but I mirror the general consensus that this is a great product. I purchased as a gift for someone that wants to easily stream music. This is very easy to use (set-up is simple via your smartphone) and so far no problems with Alexa recognizing music selections. One thing I haven't found mentioned in a review- If you're looking for 'pop' music, Alexa is fantastic at finding songs. If you're looking for 'classical,' or anything performed by specific orchestras or musicians, she's not as good at finding those yet. She'll find a version of Beethoven 6, but you might have a hard time asking for a specific orchestra playing it. ",
J4,"April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"Having Alexa is actually more useful than I thought it would be.  I bought one just to try out and see what it's like.  Having the ability to just ask a question without picking up a phone or device is great.  If you have a prime account and have amazon music it's even better, I find myself more often then not just asking Alexa to play a station or a song and because it's linked to my prime account the music plays without me having to go through my phone.  I was very surprised at how decent the speaker on the echo dot is, I was expecting a crappy small speaker that was really going to rely on connecting to a Bluetooth speaker or physical connection.  The device works really well as a standalone speaker for a decent size room.  I wouldn't trade in your nice speakers over it but if you have 2/3 dots around the house it actually works fine by itself.  I never would have foreseen myself buying multiple but after having one I can see the use for having one on each floor of my house, as a music player, as a device for asking the weather, asking questions, setting alarms, adding things to a list, making purchases, using it to control Alexa enabled devices.  It's definitely worth it for the price. ",
Chels,"November 25, 2016 ",5.0,"It doesn't get very loud but it works for a small room. I love that I can connect it to my phone and listen to my music, I can have Alexa change volume, pause, and switch songs all hands free.

"Billy B","December 16, 2016 ",4.0,"I was a very early adopter of the original Echo and wrote Amazon how they needed an Echo device that allowed Bluetooth OUT or wired audio OUT.  Yet I sat on this little gem without ordering one for a long time.  Finally pulled the trigger and am very glad I did.  Great device to hook up to your home audio system or Bluetooth speakers.  I have mine on a Bose Wave Radio in the Bedroom.  It's an amazing device that is my alarm clock, music and news source, and music entertainment.  It's simply amazing. ",
IMHO,"March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"This is an updated review.  My first Echo Dot was a failure, but the replacement is good.  My full size Echo has a better sound quality, but this little guy does the job and is small enough to sit in the kitchen and not get in the way! ***UPDATE*** I purchased the Bose Soundlink Mini 2 for my Echo Dot.  The sound is OK, HOWEVER, I also own a full size Echo and that sounds BETTER than the Echo Dot with the Bose Soundlink AND for less money!  That said, if you are focused on sound quality, it is my honest opinion that you would be better served with the full size Echo over the Dot with the Bose Mini 2.  Here is my initial review of the Echo:  I tried to get a video of this, but for some reason it won't load.  I'll try again later.  The dot works similar to the full size echo, although the sound quality is not as good.  The reason for two stars is that the dot frequently drops the internet connection and also seems to have a defective processing chip or something because when I leave it alone for more than half an hour and then speak to it, the response is a red ring and the comment of &#34;I'm having trouble understanding right now, please try again later&#34;.  Later will only happen if I unplug it and re-plug it in again.  I called technical support, and they are sending a replacement so I'll review my replacement and  update this review as this unfolds.  It is worth mention that I LOVE my full size Echo, and am still hopeful that the Dot will work. ",
"The Helpful Dad","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Overall we're impressed. The main reason I got it was to attach it to my existing stereo in order to stream music on zone 2 for my patio/bedroom/bath. I was just about to buy a Sonos Connect to do this (for over $300) but decided to try the Echo Dot first. I am so glad I did. The Echo does does a great job for this task - it connects to my stereo well and what's great is that Echo uses WIFI not bluetooth so the range to connect to it from your phone is much bigger. We can be on the opposite side of the house and use the phone to control Alexa and change the music.    Tip: I used an existing audio cable to attach to Echo Dot so you do not necessarily need to buy the extra audio cable if you already have one.  Tip: once you use voice control to activate Alexa to play music the first time, then you no longer need to keep using your voice to play music. You can just use the app on your phone and be in a different room. This is great. We can relax in the bedroom controlling Alexa while the Echo is in the living room.    The only thing I don't like is that there are minimal/almost no physical controls and the app is sometimes slow to use to control Alexa. ",
T.W,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I was skeptical at first. I loved the concept of just saying a command and having it done without getting up was a huge plus.. I also knew it was always going to be on. So i actually wrote a list of what I actually wanted to do with it, after completing the list i then decided what room of the house I would place it in. My uses for it are for music, alarms, weather and news briefings and maybe an occasional (although corny) joke or two. I also added Unlimited music to it for 3.99 (a steal). After determining my uses I decided to put it in my bedroom because I don't have a &#34;smart home&#34; and since I do most of my work in my room it was the most ideal place for it.  Needless to say it does everything i've asked it to (for the most part)  i just wish it would search for answers to questions instead of &#34;i don't understand the question&#34;. if they fix this easy 5 stars product.

"Jay V.","January 8, 2017 ",4.0,"I wish more things worked with it. It's unfair to compare to Google's offering, as they are not in the same price range.    If Alexa will let me play my google music account (which has all of my music already) then it would be 5 stars.    If Alexa allowed music to play on multiple Dots at the same time, like living room/dining room it would be 5 stars.    Otherwise, I love it. It does hear pretty well. The sound out of it, is surprisingly great. If it worked more with Google/Google Now it would be great. But this is my biggest problem, that brands don't want this synergy.

Everything from controlling the upstairs and downstairs thermostats, to turning on lights in other rooms, controlling your garage door from inside the home, setting timers, even adding to your digital calendar, when you are busy or have your hands full, the Echo-Dot will assist you along the way...

I haven't been able to make it work in a public WiFi setting yet, either. How do I get her to work with my phone plan for a portable WiFi signal? ",
JoeTAZ,"March 11, 2017 ",5.0,"When Amazon first announced the Echo I pre-ordered it and waited a few months for delivery. When it first arrived we all had fun with it but, like anything, the &#34;newness&#34; wore off. But, over time I added some Hue lights and a WeMo switch and the Echo started to be very useful in my house. We routinely use it to control lights and the TV. We also play music from it - the speakers are remarkably good.    When I heard that Logitech had a skill that would allow the Echo to work with their Harmony Ultimate remote I was excited. But, I needed another Echo for the family room. Since I didn't need the better speakers found on the Echo I went with the Dot and it's working out nicely.  I can now control all of the lights from before on both units plus I can tell my &#34;Echo to Turn the Television On&#34; or &#34;Turn on ABC&#34;, or &#34;Play the radio&#34;, etc.    If you want to play music this may not be the best choice for you - I'd go with the full size unit. The speaker on the Dot is OK but it's not great. You can pair it to a bluetooth speaker or directly connect an external speaker to it so if you have those options available to you then this is great and you'll save some money over the price of the full size unit.

Chabotjo,"November 21, 2016 ",4.0,"I am completely smitten with my Echo devices. I started with Echo (first love), then found I &#34;needed&#34; the same capability upstairs, downstairs and in my kitchen. Setting timers and alarms, checking weather, listening to ridiculous cat jokes, hearing the news and getting recipes are now easy and fun. But my constant use of the Dots has turned out to be radio and music. Before retiring I was a computer exec, and I remember my techs saying the best quality will always come from wired sound, so I dug out my old Bose media mate speakers.  You remember those - they aren't huge and we connected them to our old desk top computers so we could use our ITunes music to fill a room with great sound.  So glad I saved them. They produced perfect sound with two of my Dots and I found one more set dirt cheap on eBay, so all three Dots now have the same fabulous sound. I also took the time to upload all my iTunes music to Echo, so now when I ask Alexa to play my Christmas music, or play my Prince music, she shuffles MY music and out comes fabulous sound.  Even if you don't upload your own music, you want iHeart or TuneIn to sound great, so good speakers are a must. ",
Sean,"November 15, 2016 ",5.0,"I got this Echo dot for my mom, and then ended up ordering 3 more for everyone in our family. We have the Echo, and an Echo Dot in our home, and ABSOLUTELY love it.  Who needs Siri when you have Alexa and a much better personality?! She tells jokes, is full of history, sports info, news, shopping lists, easy ordering via Amazon, and so much more.  The speaker on the echo dot cannot put out that much. We have one in our master bedroom, which if we play music on it, without an external speaker, it works, but its not amazing.  Overall, the recall for info for these devises is really good. Its fast. This makes a great gift item for many different types of people. ",
"Meghan Blake","December 17, 2016 ",5.0,"It's a cool concept for the product but the majority of the time it says it doesn't understand what i am asking even when it is a simple question. If you open the app on your phone it tells you what you asked recently so it is easy to see what work she got mixed up on. Most of the time I can't believe it didnt understand a simple word and confused it for something else. Or if it didnt mix up words it still doesnt know the answer to the question. I really wanted this to be a great product as i got it for a gift for my dad but more often than not he ends up asking Siri his question and gets an aswer after Alexa &#34;is not sure what you are asking.&#34; ",
"Amazon Customer","December 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I own an Echo as well as lots of other Amazon devices (Fire TV, Fire TV sticks, Fire tablets, I even owned a fire phone (ouch!)).  I'm usually very happy with them, but this dot has issues.  I purchased with the expectation that I could use my bluetooth speaker (Bose) with it.  I had been using my phone attached to the bluetooth Bose to play amazon music, but this Dot is terrible when running thru Bluetooth.  When I give it a command, it will &#34;hang&#34; for a minute (60 seconds or so) before it will perform the command, if it performs the command.  While this is happening, the music is at a very low volume so it very disruptive.  The Bluetooth speaker works fine with all other devices I've paired it with, it's only this dot that has an issue.  I can use the dot with a wired connection to the speaker (which is what I'm doing), but I really expected the dot to work as advertised.  wired or without a speaker, it works fine. ",

She loves the stories, jokes, and music --plus quite a few other skills.  I like for her to have it because it allows her to get these fun things without using her phone!  The phone has too many features -- even just simply turning on music may mean she spends time looking at stuff online, texting, or playing with apps.

You can ask about the weather, the time, the latest news, set an alarm, set a timer, ask a question of Wikipedia, ask what song or singer is currently on, pause, play, stop, change volume, ask how to spell something, she tells jokes and plays 20 Questions or Jeopardy...the list goes on and on and it's all done just with your voice.

"Valerie Ballard","April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I love Alexa!  She does so much for me!  She plays any music I ask for ($3.99 for Amazon Music Unlimited for Prime members on one device). She reads my Kindle books to me. Okay she doesn't have the same voice inflections as with Audible, but her narrations don't cost $15 per month either! She gives me traffic reports. She plays games with me. She controls all of my smart devices, lights, plugs etc.  She keeps track of my schedule, sets alarms, and even says nice things to me.  I have only had her for a couple of weeks and I find more uses for her every day.  They're always adding new skills, and best of all, they're free!  As I grow my Smart Home, I haven't found anything that she hasn't been able to handle.  Just search Amazon for things that say &#34;works with Alexa.&#34;  Needless to say, I am very happy with my new room mate.  She doesn't eat a lot and never makes a mess.  She never argues and is always supportive.  She wishes me good sleep at night, greets me nicely in the morning and when I come home.  What more could you want?

"Cynthia J. Salim","April 4, 2017 ",1.0,"DOT can be frustrating but I do enjoy the convenience when it works. I have two DOTS and a speakers connected to each DOT. Each DOT is used on a different floor of my home. The DOT in my bedroom is connected to a speaker by WIFI also connected to that DOT is a smart plug that controls a lamp. The DOT in my living area is connected using a cable to a speaker. I intend to have smart thermostats installed and connected too. I enjoy the music selection available using DOT. And,  I enjoy the convenience of weather reports, news, time, alarms, etc.    My beef is that sometimes DOT does not work using the voice mode. I can usually get what I want by going into my ALEXA APP and making a manual request. This happens most often at night when I want to have my lamp turned off or my music turned on. I am not sure why this happens. Generally, in the morning when I try the same request that failed at night, it works. When these failures occur, I check to make sure WiFi is working and it always is. ALEXA also lights up indicating that she hears me but does not execute the request. I am starting to wonder if I have made a mistake by buying the expensive Smart thermostats.    If anyone has any tips on how to get DOT to be more consistent, please share. ",
Theresa1,"April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"I like the integration for the smart plugs.  It will be nice that when asked to look something up it does not rely on wikipedia.  Right now it's functionality is limited.  At least it can tell me the weather, control my lights and play music.    Update 4/15/17:  Third party apps does not work seamless with the echo dot like the Kasa app for TP link, half of the the time Alexa cannot find the device.  It is nice just to speak from across the room to turn the lights on if the devices will work smoothly together.  I tried the Apple home kit with another brand smart plug for comparison, Apple app set up and the integration of the third party app has less steps and they work well together. ",
"Nicholas Ferri","March 9, 2017 ",4.0,"I purchased this Dot for a relative, but have one of my own at home. Alexa is fantastic. The Dot links to your wireless internet very easily and using the Alexa App is simple. Be careful not to download too many skills since you tend to forget the commands to open them if you have too many, but with practice, you'll be fine. There are more skills and more products offering Alexa compatibility added daily making her the best in the market at home personal assistant. I typically use her with weather, daily news, traffic updates, the shopping list, the Philips Hue link, my Vivint Home Security (Note that she can not open or unlock anything due to security issues), and definitely my If This Then That link (which I recommend digging into). As mentioned above, she has a ton of Skills that she can learn which make life at home more fun (trivia, word adventures, games, jokes, etc) and a lot simpler (allrecipes, fitbit, etc). I have easily convinced a good portion of my family to buy a Dot if not the full speaker Echo, and would highly recommend her to anyone. I would give her 6 stars if possible. ",
"R. Kosh","March 30, 2017 ",3.0,"I kept putting off buying an Echo and now I'm glad I did. The Dot does everything the Echo does but with a smaller form factor and price. It was cheap enough that I bought two--one for the living room and another for my bedroom. The Dot is actually sensitive enough that I could have survived with one, but wanted to be able to control the bedroom lights without having to shout to the Dot in the living room. With two, they automatically work together to select the one closest to you when you speak. I like being able to get into bed at night, and just saying, &#34;Alexa, turn off the bedroom light.&#34; I can even use it to wake me up if I want to get up earlier than my alarm clock would.  It's a lot easier to tell Alexa to wake me up at 4:30 than it is to reset my alarm clock for one day.    I'm using to more and more every day, everything from playing music to turning on lights and all it takes is my voice.  I should have done this sooner. The Dot makes a lot of sense, especially if you have an upstairs and a downstairs and don't want to have to yell downstairs to add soap to your Amazon basket. Great job, Amazon. ",

BoilerGator,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I have the Echo Dot and Google Home. The Echo Dot is great for playing Amazon Prime Music, Audible books, and specific skills/apps through Amazon (e.g., smart home lights and thermostats can be controlled by Alexa). However, Google Home is much better at general questions, recipes, facts, etc. Google Home can be linked to your Pandora or other streaming music account, so it will also play music. I think the speaker for the Amazon Echo is better than Google Home. You can't beat the price of the Echo Dot. ",
"Aaron Thompson","March 7, 2017 ",3.0,"The voice recognition ability is amazing, and the Amazon Echo team is constantly improving things behind the scenes. Alexa's voice is very pleasant and easy to understand, despite the size of the Dot. Sound quality can easily be improved through the 1/8&#34; stereo jack or by pairing with Bluetooth devices. The light ring is a great way to confirm you were heard. From a kid who grew up with Speak & Spell, the Echo Dot definitely shows how far technology has come. Definitely recommended to any techie out there. $50? What are you waiting for? ",
"Jane Johnson,  Trusted Reviews","April 23, 2017 ",4.0,"The Amazon Echo Dot is amazing technology. Small and unassuming, she sits quietly waiting for you to ask her something, to add items to your to do list, grocery list,  and so much more.  I Love to sit at the end of the day in my favorite chair and say,  &#34;Alexa,  play classical piano&#34;....and immediately, the music fills the room.  Your grocery and to do list shows on your smartphone. That is not even half of what she can do.  Turn lights on/off  turn TV on,  much, much more. I am very impressed with this small and mighty gadget. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 24, 2017 ",5.0,"Does pretty much everything my full-size Echo does. It's small size makes it great for a beside table or other area where the full-size is too large.The main difference, other than size, is music quality is a bit less than big Echo. It still sounds good; but if you want fuller sound, watch for a sale, and get yourself a good Bluetooth speaker. I have paired a smart plug with it so I can voice-control a bedroom lamp. Small package, great results. If you want Echo benefits, but the budget is tight, you can't go wrong with the Dot. ",
"Mary K Wojcik","February 28, 2017 ",5.0,"Purchased 2 of these.  One for my bedroom, the other for my sons room (purchased for his birthday).  I have mine connected to a Bluetooth for improved sound, I love listening to it when I am busy with laundry, cleaning etc.  My sons is not connected to a Bluetooth device, the sound quality is fine for him and his bedroom.  I only wish when listening to music I could create a playlist that Alexa would play. Meaning I would love to say Alexa, play &#34;my favorites&#34; and have her do that.  I love amazon unlimited music too and how prime members get a discount. ",
"MommaCX3 ☀️","March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"Great product. All the awesome features of Alexa minus the exceptional sound quality of the Echo. If you don't have an Echo you wouldn't know the sound isn't as good though (I don't think). We have the Dot in my son's room. He loves using it for weather updates, audiobooks, timers, various questions and music. We rely on our Echo for the most part for music but otherwise the Dot can't be beat, especially for the price. ",
"Michael McKee","March 24, 2017 ",5.0,"My wife makes fun of me for talking to my new &#34;girlfriend&#34; all the time. I got some Philips Hue lights (and hub) and use the Echo to adjust my lights. Love the dimmer function. I play music from Prime through this and my bluetooth speaker. I also use it for Audible books. Just make sure that you don't have it read a story with a character named Alexa or Alexis. That can have amusing results.    I also use it to make shopping lists and convert weights and measurements. It will also play radio stations and give the weather. ",
Tevern,"April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"This review is for the Echo Dot, version 2.  Up front I will say that I have purchased the original Echo, the Echo Dot, v1 and the Echo Dot, v2.  I love the idea of the product, but the quality of the Dot 2 is not good.  My original Echo (purchased 11/3/15) and the Dot 1 (purchased 3/3/16) are working fine.  They come with a 1 year warranty. The Dot 2 come with a 90 day warranty.  There is a reason for that - the Dot 2 is a piece of crap.  They lowered the price and the quality of the product.  The Dot 2 (purchased 9/18/16) died on 3/3/17, less than six months in use.  It was never dropped or abused in any way.  One day it simply said it had trouble connecting to the internet; I tried to reconnect it, but it consistently failed.  I got hold of tech support and have spent hours, literally, on the phone with them and they have not been able to get it to work either.  The error code (73441), they say they can't find in their manual. Because it is out of warranty I now own a worthless piece of junk.  Beware. ",
"Robyn P","February 15, 2017 ",5.0,"After having the Dot for a few weeks, I have to say Alexa doesn't know much! I ask simple questions and I get &#34;Hmmm, I don't know how to answer that&#34;.  I put a series of questions to both Alexa and Ok Google and Google answered them all. Alexa couldn't answer any. I understand  you must enable skills, and I have, but for basic questions??? Google is the clear winner here.  That being said, I pay for the Unlimited  music for $3.99 and basically use the Dot as a personal  DJ. I tell her what to play and she does it. For $50, it's a neat gadget, but my next gadget will be Google Home. ",
"Susan Layman","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My husband's doctor suggested I order this for my husband who has Alzheimers.  The doctor thought it would be helpful so that he could always know the time, date, weather, what sports teams are playing. etc.  Unfortunately he is not fast enough with his question after he says Alexa so it hasn't worked for the original purpose.  I use it a lot and enjoy listening to the music while I'm doing things in the house.  It's also fun with my nieces and nephew come over because they can ask Alexa to tell them a kids joke. ",
"Jon P.","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I have loved my Amazon Echo that I have had for nearly 2 years.  I love being able to use the Amazon Echo for voice control of my living room lights and other compatible devices (i.e. my Nest thermostat).  The cost of the Amazon Echo was the only thing holding me back from putting one in other parts of the house.  As soon as I saw the Echo Dot (2nd gen) advertised for sale I immediately ordered 3 of them to put in other parts of my house.  I already had a good speaker system in my bedroom so I added a Dot there.  I put another in my wife's office and attached a set of Bose speakers and I put one in the Kitchen (no external speakers but that one is not for listening to music).    All 3 Dots were incredibly easy to set up and all are working perfectly.  The only difference I noticed about them compared to the Amazon Echo (besides the sound quality) is the dots seem to take slightly longer to turn my lights on and off.  I am not 100% sure they take longer but it seems like they are just a bit slower but not enough to really make a difference. ",
Raj,"March 27, 2017 ",5.0,"A perfect Operating System for a smart home. Have connected it with my ecobee3, Osram Lighitify, Microsoft outlook account, Spotify account, Bose speakers. Has made life super simple and exciting! Voice controls work like a charm on all these devices. The smart home skill app library is super vast and is very exciting to see more partners getting added each day! The speaker quality is agreeably good, i am happy to listen to some mellow music on them without turning on my bose speakers. The MIC is exceptionally good and understands my voice and accent from any corner of the room. ",
Labs2,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"I love this thing so much I bought another one for my office. I have one in the kitchen and have found it so useful for playing music, getting weather, asking about measurements,  and hearing what is going on in the news I decided to get one for my office so I can control the lights as well. It seems like there are more and more things it is able to do and can hear you so well it's mind boggling. I have gotten so use to Apple Siri sucking so bad I was a little nervous, but Echo is on a completely different level. Buy one to check it out and when you fall in love with it, get another one for anther room! ",
"TG RabidBeaver","April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"Next to sliced bread, the wheel and fire, the Amazon Echo Dot may be the single greatest invention ever (perhaps even better than gravity itself).    I bought one after seeing a good friend's setup where he utilizes his dot along with his Nest thermostat and his Hue Lighting.  I must say, anything that helps me be lazier when I am at home, it truly gets two thumbs up.  Now if I could just convince Alexa to bring me 2 fingers of my favorite Bourbon while I'm watching the game......    Come on Amazon, make it happen! ",
gn27,"March 18, 2017 ",5.0,"Started out really good, but now I have to say things twice before they actually happen. Everyday it's &#34;Alexa turn on the lights&#34; then she thinks for a minute and nothing happens, so then I say it again and by then it usually works. This happens with many things and the problem is absolutely with the echo and not the smart lights because most of the time the echo never responds. Hopefully amazon will make this product better, right now it seems to have quite a few glitches. ",
Sanqofa,"March 29, 2017 ",5.0,"Friends told me about Alexa, but I now am a witness to this device.  Set up is a breeze and just looking at all of the skills that Amazon has is pleasantly overwhelming.  What pushed me over (may not be a big deal to anyone else) was the same You Version Bible App that I have on my phone.  I have set a daily plan for Alexa to read the Bible to me.    As well as, other mobile apps that I have previously used, were found in Alexa skills.  I normally don't write any review.... however this was worth taking time to share my excitement about the Amazon Echo Dot 2nd Generation.  I'm sure I will discover other skills for Alexa, but the You Version Bible App was worthy to share my two cents!    Great Job Amazon! ",
"T. Sheridan","March 1, 2017 ",2.0,"I liked my tap, now I love the dot. I have the tap in my office because I am always on conference calls, I didn't want it to have any &#34;false alarms.&#34; I added the Dot to the family room and use it most often to control the lights, thermostat, and other devices around the house. It's also useful for random questions while watching movies, such as bios on actors or &#34;Is so-and-so dead or alive?&#34;  The voice recognition is very good, but you do need to practice a bit to be understood consistently.

jab,"March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"Just got it yesterday and I also purchased a speaker system for computer from another store. I know the speakers not real loud but it works great. The speaker itself is about the volume of my iPhone.  It is not stereo for music.  Adding the speakers that I purchased I have more of a complete stero sound. It also reads my latest novel on kindle on my fire tablet  I do not have a smart TV or smart lights but what it does is fine with me. A great System for senior citizens  and especially if they have had Eye surgery  OK, I have had this echo dot  for two weeks and loved it in. I went to another store and picked up another echo for my bedroom. I just ordered  a smart lightbulb for my bedroom  that should work with my echo. I have signed up for my buddy and that will work in my bedroom and my living room.  The only problem I had when I called the name  Alexa as I called it too fast and it doesn't recognize it. I've had to say the name slowly and then it recognizes it. ",
"Justin Andrew Mayer","April 23, 2017 ",5.0,"I think I must have a defective one....Alexa is the dumbest artificial intelligence ever!  The only thing she is honestly good for is the weather and playing songs.  If we ask her 20 questions she might know the answers to 2 of them....super over rated and over hyped!  Should have just spent the extra money for the Google home.  It works for controlling the thermostat like 50% of the time lol!  Amazon still has TONS of work ahead of them with these lot's of improvements needed.  Most people seem to have better luck them me but everyone that comes over can't believe how useless this thing really is! ",
TonyaMoore,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I received this on release date and boy am I happy, so happy I bought 2 more (plan to get more). I've always wanted to make my home a smart home but I'm not tech savvy and cost too much to have someone come in the do the hookups and training on equipment, with this I home went from Plain-Jane to WOW (all my lights can now be turned on and off just by the sound of my voice + Smart Plugs I've purchased for other items in my home, my next purchase will be the thermostat that can be controlled by Alexa). My grandson is having as much fun as I am (age 7), he asks her to read books, tell jokes, sing children songs, I don't even have to complain about burning lights since my home is now a smart home he tells Alexa to turn off the lights when he's leaving a room. The price can't be beat, I never thought with such little money I could do so much to my home. I have just about every product Amazon makes and this by far is the best purchase I've made. If I had to complain about this product I'd say I wish I could ask Alexa to play songs from YouTube but since I can connect through Bluetooth it's not much of an issue. THANKS AMAZON ",
"Amazon Customer","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I love Alexa. This is my 2nd dot. They make great presents too! If you're thinking about getting one....DO IT!!! She does so much. She will play music, give you the weather, google something for you, add things to your shopping list and to-do list. She can turn your lights and other devices on. So nice to ask her for the temperature before I head outside. She's very quick and she understands very well. She will tell you the temperature in other places as well, just ask. She will set timers, alarms. The more you use her, the more you find new things. She's rather funny too so she's entertaining as well. ",
"Amazon Customer","October 27, 2016 ",5.0,"I have a new favorite toy and her name is Alexa! This device is great. The amount of skills that are available are wonderful and I have only begun to scratch the surface. Plus there continues to be new skills added all the time. I'm a bit of a techie and while I have other devices that will do many of these activities, it is great to be able to get the functionality by voice command and for this price who could ask for more. When initially getting the device, it was challenging with the number of commercials that were on to promote the device as every time that Alexa was said on screen it would awaken my device. However this has improved over time and she no longer responds to them. By the same token, it was a bit challenging using the alarm functionality in the mornings particularly while I was sick as she would not respond to my morning voice but this seems to have improved as well. Overall I love this device and have recommended it to a few friends and coworkers who were considering them as Christmas requests/gifts. ",
SWSX711,"March 9, 2017 ",5.0,"I got echo so i can use the smart home power outlets. works with a lot of smart home device only reason i got. have both google home and amazon echo. hands down the google home wins overall. only thing google home doesnt win is smart home devices. google home only works with a few smart home device at the moment. the responsiveness is better on the google home, music streaming is much better on google home and wider ranger of streaming service compare to amazon echo. amazon echo you have to pay to listen to certain songs. i feel like google can do alot more also. I would recommend google home over amazon echo. ",
KCB,"December 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I already had the original Echo, use it every day and really enjoy it.  I was thinking that it would be nice to have the same functions in a smaller package for our bedroom.  One of the main things we use the Echo for is to listen to Prime Music and I wasn't sure how well the Dot would do for that purpose.  I think that the sound quality of my larger Echo is very good.    While the functions of the Dot and the full sized Echo are the same, the Dot clearly doesn't have the same sound quality.  For the low price, it wouldn't be fair to expect it to sound the same.  This is offset by your ability to attach the Dot via Bluetooth, to either speakers or headphones if you like.  We have found though that when we want to listen to music in bed while reading, the sound from the Dot is still fine for our needs, at low volume.    Overall, I think that the Dot is an excellent value, it is small enough that you can put it almost anywhere and it is really nice to have in the room for the many features that it has. ",
"That one girl that buys stuff","December 7, 2016 ",3.0,"I got tired of walking downstairs to give Alexa the grocery list, so I did what any red blooded lazy American would do. I got a Dot. She sets on the dresser and listens to me when I need her to and does everything that the Alexa would do. Her jokes are just as bad as Alexa's. She does have a small glitch, I ask her about the weather and she's not quite sure what city I live it...... ",
Brandy,"January 22, 2017 ",5.0,"Purchased the dot for my children to use so they will leave mine alone. I love this product however I wish it didn't run off BING as google would be so much better.

I no longer even have to turn off their bedroom light as they can do it themselves from their bed. ",
"Karen Herring","March 17, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought an Echo for my husband & he absolutely loves it. And I have enjoyed playing with it as well. He is really into music and the sound system it's pretty spectacular. I was seriously considering purchasing a second one for the house and then I read about the echo Dot and purchased it instead. It does exactly the same as the echo except for the speaker system and I am okay with that. It got here yesterday and I already had the app on my phone and I started playing around with all the skills. I love the night light and the Food Network skill. I played Jeopardy and did Seinfeld trivia just for the fun of it. I love that I can wake up in the middle of the night and quietly whisper Alexa and the device comes on and I can ask it what time it is. No more fumbling for my cell phone and being Blinded by the Light. I love Amazon and all of their products. I have a Kindle and three Fire Sticks and now we enjoy the Echo and the echo Dot. I have never had any problems with Amazon products I highly recommend everything especially this Echo Dot ",
Mark,"December 17, 2016 ",4.0,"Works as advertised, received my second dot today.  First one is in the living room and the second one is in my bedroom.  Setup was a breeze through the app. Sound was great, but I did try a Bluetooth headset, and she paired with it.  All one has to do is say Alexa volume 1 for low or five for medium volume, etc.  I also paired to a wireless speaker, the jam touch. Again all volume is just speak to Alexa.  Also if you want great sound connect it to your sound system.  When the alarm goes off it will definitely get you out of bed.    I am considering another one for the kitchen. Also the light bulbs, I keep losing the remote for my lamps or it's always away from where your sitting.    Getting my set up for smart devices is intriguing and exciting at the same time.  The future is now!!  Don't delay in buying this item, you can't go wrong for the price.    You do have to set up the first time with your wi-fi so you have to remember your router name and password for the initial setup. Also, download the Alexa app and setup is a breeze, just follow the on screen instructions. ",
Bilgewater,"December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Alexa (Echo Dot) works beautifully.  The sound is a bit different than her big sister, but that's to be expected as she's so petite and doesn't have as much space for a bigger speaker.  Her big sister is downstairs and is constantly in use for household items...and the occasional joke, while the little sister is upstairs and so gets less use...generally at bedtime.  The big sister came first, at Christmas time, while little sister is only a couple of weeks old.  A great invention, and very useful.  We love being able to add items to our shopping list that is then available via iPhone when shopping. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This is a great affordable option to turn each room into a smart room. It connects to speakers via Bluetooth or with a supplied audio cable so if you have an existing system this would be a good addition. The only 2 reasons why I knocked a star off was 1. The sound isn't great unless you have a speaker for it and if you're looking for a great sounding echo then just spring for the bigger one that you can even have a payment plan for added convenience. And 2. The thing that really bugged me was the response time after saying &#34;alexa&#34; was a bit slower that that of my full sized echo AND my echo dot gen 1. But I will say for the cost this is a great option for any home and would go great in a kids room to use for music and even helps my kids with spelling and basic math as well as reading audio books to them so that alone to me makes the 50 bucks well worth it. I highly recommend this amazing product, I've been using mine constantly since I got it and Alexa has become the hub that truly converted my home into a smart home. ",
"J Herrell","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Pretty cool little gadget, our family loves it! I didn't give it 5 Stars because I am already a Prime subscriber but I need to pay extra for Amazon music. I also didn't realize it didn't cover both my Alexa products, I signed up for Amazon music on my Dot which is also connected to my app but it doesn't play on my Echo. Apparently you have to pay a fee per device every month. I think that is silly and I will be canceling my subscription on the Dot and just doing it on the Echo because we use that one more.  My favorite part is, I blew up my white noise maker while in Italy (bad outlet converter) and I can put white noise (Pure White Noise by Deep Sound Sleep) on and press repeat for white noise all night while I sleep.  We also like the &#34;skills&#34;, especially the Tonight Show skill, you can ask Alexa what everyone is talking about and she states the &#34;tight pants&#34; song lyrics which is a family favorite.  Overall I am happy with it. ",
"Misha Lupisha","December 6, 2016 ",4.0,"Oh my. How easy it was to start using it. It is a true plug-and-play.  When Amazon announced the new Echo Dot, I ordered it right away. (In fact, I ordered two, and holding one as a holiday gift to my son.) My son thought it was going to be just another gadget, but he uses mine just about everyday, and I can see that he is going to want his own to use in his room. The accessibility to music is great. Lots of &#34;skills&#34; already built in, and I'm looking forward to discovering more skills as they become available. Right now we mainly use it for playing music, but it's also handy to just be able to ask what time it is in any foreign country, as I often communicate with overseas for work and with family.  We hooked our Dot up to a good set of Bose speakers, but even without the external speakers, it has a pretty good speaker if you are hearing it in a small room. The voice recognition is amazingly accurate. I am impressed. I wasn't at all interested in the earlier version of Echo, but with this tiny size of Dot, I was sold! I LOVE it. ",
"S. Gladwin","March 7, 2017 ",4.0,"One of the most used devices in my home. I have it set up as an alarm clock (set only for weekdays, nice touch) but use it quite often to stream music, including radio stations all over the Country (Playing New Orleans Jazz radio up here in New England is awesome!) as well as have it linked with my smart devices throughout the home. Best part is that my Dot is in my kitchen and from my upstairs bedroom I can ask  it to play music, tell me the time, etc. and even with the echos it still gets my commands right almost always.    Great little device, I'm looking forward to what it can do in the future. ",
Fegarex,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"When the original Echo came out I wanted one but didn't want to pay the price. I bought mine at $49.95 and they have been less and are well worth the price. It makes a good stepping stone for home automation or really improves an existing system. I have most of my home automated and the addition of the Echo Dot was seamless. Like all things like this it does take a bit of messing around but it worked well and set up was easy. The ability for it to hear voice commands is fantastic. I can be in other rooms and say a command. It is also fast. I think many times it works faster than a tablet for the remote commands. Sound is adequate but I wasn't that concerned about that as I listen to my music on a stereo. I did have a set of better computer speakers I added to it to improve sound/volume but the speaker in it works decent for voice.  Alexa isn't as good as Google voice for a variety of questions but does well with many and ties into Amazon well.  It amazes me how much this thing will do for $50.00!! ",
"Robert Ricks","December 7, 2016 ",5.0,"Unexpectedly useful. Love the hands free timer in the kitchen. Adding items to shopping or &#34;to do&#34; lists for later review on the app is easy.    Responsiveness, accuracy and integrated speaker are better than anticipated.  Considering adding another Dot to bedroom to replace alarm clock.    Haven't considered home automation yet.    Cons vs Google Home:  1) each Dot operates independently (multi-room synch not yet avail for Dot, Echo or Tap).  2) Google Home has wider range of promo music (pulls from Youtube red)    Pros:  1) only $40 (promo price). Great entry into voice automation. However, Chromecast audio is certainly a challenger if you only need to connect streaming audio to your dumb speakers (Best Buy sale $25).    Overall, the Dot is a great choice for the kitchen or bedroom. Chromecast audio might be a cheaper choice to connect to your &#34;dumb&#34; speakers and set up multi room audio but it lacks bluetooth and voice recognition. ",
"Cassie H","December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought this along with the Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3 for my father's birthday. Unfortunately, I learned after the fact that Alexa does not work with my father's phone, but only mine. He has a Galaxy and I have an iPhone. Apparently his phone does not have the Alexa app which is needed in order to properly use Alexa. She is useful once you learn what she can actually do, but it can be frustrating when you can't remember the exact command sequence so Alexa cannot answer your question. Overall, a great invention, but I think its been harder for us to learn Alexa than it is for Alexa to learn us. ",

"Amazon Customer","December 8, 2016 ",3.0,"We've had an echo for a long  time. We were one of the first in the beta deal and got it for a very cheap price. We use it much more than I thought we ever would. My wife loves it for music, math equations, food measurement conversions, weather, and news. We also have it controlling our lights and our ecobee thermostat. We just got the echo dot and I must admit I think I like it even more. I bluetooth-ed it to my Bose mini soundlink and it sounds fantastic. Other than that, it performs equally as good as our full sized echo but it's much smaller and way cheaper. We got it for the black friday price of $39.99 which to me is a steal for all it can do. The Googe Home seemed interesting but for Less than $50, and the ability to hook up to stereo or bluetooth speakers, the dot just seems the better choice. If you can still get it on sale, I think it's an excellent deal and has been very helpful and entertaining for our family. It doesn't do everything but what it does do, it does well for a cheap price. ",
"E. Jones","January 1, 2017 ",5.0,"Works great however a lot of times it doesn't understand things I am asking her. Such as, looking  up something on the Internet. You have to be more defined in your search or your questions. And for the traffic it doesn't work at all. All it does is just gives me the best route not the traffic conditions on that route. But all in all I really happy with it. I use it to turn on the lights my house. I use it to listen to music. And also I love it when it's reads my audiobooks for me. Also I love the feedback when you have a problem with it. Amazon gets right back to you with helpful suggestions. ",
"Sara A. Rubinson","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Alexia is my new BFF so far, we're getting along really well and I'm considering having her replace some of my more high maintenance friends.    However, like real humans, she does have downfalls. It says she will search for things on bing that she doesn't know, I can't figure out how to get her to do that. Also, her speaker sucks! My apartment is about 600 square feet and at the loudest I can't really hear her when I leave from the immediate vicinity (my dad has the regular echo and the sound quality is insane- there's no comparison). I just got her a friend - a Bluetooth speaker that I think will solve the problem.    She is pretty effin awesome though. I love that I can control her when I'm not home through the app, I use her mostly to play music when I'm at work for my dogs. ",
Scarlett_Kat,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I love my Echo-Dot (2nd Generation). I mainly bought it because I wanted a speaker to listen to music, yet I thought this would be fun to get some other information from as well. As I am getting to know &quot;Alexa&quot; I am realizing she has a lot of capabilities to play games like 20 Questions, Rock Paper Scissors, Bingo, Jeopardy 6...among many others. She has a sense of humor. She can give you news and answer questions. She is voice command and has new things Amazon adds all the time. My family really gets a kick out of her. We enjoyed it so much, my son also bought one for his room. The only draw back that I have found so far is that it doesn't have a parent control. But whatever your kids are asking it, does come up on a log so you can see what they are asking. If they say anything inappropriate you should know about it with the Alexa App. It does have an option to turn off purchasing, so your kids aren't ordering things from your account. I have had it for over a month and I am very happy with it. ",
"Kevin P Overholt","March 5, 2017 ",4.0,"Using in my office for now and voice recognition works perfect so far. I changed from Alexa to Amazon as I thought that sounds more natural. I find from time to time that I use the word Amazon in my conversations and I see it light up, kind of funny. I have not done much else with it yet other than ask it to play Christmas music and seeing as I have not setup Pandora or any other music I assume it defaults to Amazon prime music which is pretty nice. I have a couple Blink cameras and plan to set them up next. I also have a Vera home automation system that pretty much runs itself but from time to time when I have to enable it etc. and would be nice to have voice commands instead of getting my phone out, logging into the app and making the change. I bought the Echo Dot so I could use it with my whole house speakers but have not been able to find a way to hook up the 3.5mm external speaker jack to my four banana plugs that control my four rooms. I will post an update when I have tried these out. ",
Jeff,"January 30, 2017 ",5.0,"I have an Amazon Echo in the living room and purchased the Echo Dot for the bedroom. They both do the same thing. The Echo Dot is a little slower to respond than the Amazon Echo but other than that it works great. If both Echo's happen to hear me, only one responds. They do not interfere with each other. I use mine for controlling lighting and the thermostat and I'm very happy with the results. The audio quality of the Echo Dot is not as good and the Amazon Echo but plenty good enough for most functions. If you want to listen to music then you can always add a quality speaker. I would buy this again. ",
"G. Stapleton","December 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I use this anytime I am in the kitchen for a long period of time. My other main echo is in my bedroom. The key to this type of technology is to just use it. It's easy for one not to find a need for a product like this. Mainly because they have it on their phone, which they don't use either. I use mine for any and everything. I ask the weather before I leave work, I am constantly asking fo the time, I listen to my Spotify through it and the list goes on. I even download extra things that the echo offers through the website to add even more complexity to it.    So, buy it and use it. ",
"Bob Johnson","December 5, 2016 ",4.0,"I have been watching the Echo and reviews and when they came out with the Dot 2nd Gen for $50 I thought this was the time to try...  Boy am I glad :)    I bought a Dot and then 2 days later ordered another.  Using primarily for Amazon music, I also signed up for the Amazon Unlimited Music.  We have 1 Dot in the Kitchen with an inexpensive, but great little blue tooth speaker by Anker, and the other is connected to our Main Entertainment system and the music is just outstanding.    We are also taking advantage of the Shopping List function, perfect for adding items when you are in the kitchen.  Also integration with our Harmony Hub using IF (ifttt) and we have set up additional triggers for shopping cart notification, to send the shopping list to our phones.    Our 4 year old grandson is already asking Alexa to play kids songs he likes and is so pleased when he asks for a song and it starts playing    Overall we are extremely pleased with the Dot and plan on getting a third to put out in my workshop.    If you are tempted, then just try it :) ",
YellowBug,"March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I love it already !  It was so easy to set up with very clear and concise instructions.  I got two this year for Christmas, so I can put one by my bed and one in the den. Amazon might want to make the cord white to match the white Dot for those of us that these things matter :)  So glad I bought it !!  UPDATE:  Now that I have had this device for over two months I still like it, BUT it has yet to answer even one of my questions.  I hate the fact that Amazon decided to use BING...who thought that was a good idea ?  The fact that Alexa can not give me answers to my inquiries is enough to make me want to check out Google Home. ",
"Adam M","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Mostly a novelty for now but the kids love it. We must ask Alexa for 20 jokes a day and the ability to play any song is fantastic. From a practical perspective, I find new things to use it for everyday. For now, the simple timer operation is nice, simply because my hands are usually full when I'm grilling or trying to cook so this little guys makes it easy to set a timer and continue without having to stop and wash hands, etc.    The sound quality is OK and as expected for such a small device. I did buy a Bluetooth adapter so this hooked up to my Niles Audio system and it worked OK. However, I wish there was a way to pump music through the Bluetooth connection but continue to use the Alexa for questions and other stuff.However, I'll probably need another Echo to do this. Also, the sounds quality through the Bluetooth connection is OK, but nothing compared to the iPod or Sirius sound quality directly connected to the Niles unit which is far superior.    All in all, more novelty than practical. ",
Jennifer,"December 25, 2016 ",5.0,"There is not one thing I can say differently than the previous 5,000 +positive reviews left, but I had to say how much I LOVE this product! I bought 6 for Christmas gifts and am going to purchase more tonight.  I love asking Alexa to play my favorite music, ask her when the next full moon is, what the temp is, turn on BBC,, turn on Audible  or the hundreds of other things I ask her to do daily.  I am waiting for my wi-fi outlet plugs to come in to turn off lights and such as that will only increase my joy in this product!  Amazon has hit it out of the park with this item.  I thought that the Kindle was the greatest thing going (still is pretty cool), but this is it.  It is perfect for all ages.  I purchased this for my 11 year old niece and she adores it.  She uses it to help with her homework and read stories with.  She listens to music and is able to turn off her tv and lights without leaving her bed.  Don't hesitate to purchase this for everyone in your life, including yourself! ",
"Kahlos Mahn","December 5, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my Amazon Echo Dot! Got one for Christmas and was so excited to set it up! I have a Magic Home bluetooth lightbulb which works great (3 step process to set it up) easily connected my Spotify account, and added a couple of fun skills (weather, dream-machine noises, comedy central, NPR, horoscope, etc.) and use it everyday! It's most handy when I first wake up and groggily say 'Alexa stop!' and the alarm fades away, then I listen to the weather and get a flash briefing on what's new in the news while I get ready for work, maybe ask her to play a song to pep me up. Then at night I ask her to turn the lights on (though I've noticed a bit of lag from the Magic Home lighbulb, not Echo's fault, it happens with Magic Home Android app too) and am planning on getting another BT lightbulb for my overhead room-light-fixture. Overall this is a great product, the sound quality is great for such a little thing, after doing the initial voice set up, Alexa understands me even when I'm dozing off and slurring my words, asking her to turn the lights off. :) ",

She does have a small glitch, I ask her about the weather and she's not quite sure what city I live it...... ",
"K. Vann","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"It's really the best, most affordable solution for streaming music around the house. All of the other Alexa functions are just icing on top. Integrated control buttons (unlike the Chromecast Audio for example), voice control, and line out to whatever speakers you want!

I love my Echo Dots, and I will be buying more. ",
"David Allen","March 17, 2017 ",5.0,"My family of Amazon product now include 2 Amazon Echos, 2 first gen Amazon Dots, 2 second gen Amazon Dots (one black and one white), 1 Amazon Tap, assorted Amazon Dash buttons (about 8 I think).    The good new is the newest Dot comes with the new software already installed that provides you with ESP (Echo Spatial Perception) that keeps your devices from fighting over who will answer you.  The closest Echo or Dot gives you your answer or replies to your commands.  Thank you Amazon!  (BTW - my older products updated so they also have ESP now).    The new Dots are a bit smaller and are shiny unlike the first generation that was a flat black.  Installation was easy and only took a couple of minutes for each to connect to my network (using the Alexa app).    Size: NEW - 1.3&quot;x3.3&quot;x3.3&quot; 5.7oz OLD - 1.5&quot;x3.3&quot;x3.3&quot; 8.8oz    Volume Adjustment: NEW - volume up and down buttons OLD - volume ring    Warranty: NEW - 90 days included OLD - 1 year included    You do not get a 3.5 mm audio cable included with the new dot.    New color choice of white.    Price is $30 cheaper than the first generation dots.    I know that Amazon was the first one to really grab the market with these types of devices - beating out the Google and Apple devices (well, Siri on Apple products).  At first she (my girl Alexa) didn't do much more than play some songs and figured out difficult mathematical problems for me.  Now they have all gotten a lot smarter!  I turn lights on and off, adjust my thermostat, play music, find my phone, set timers/alarms and most of all my shopping list!  I love this concept and the Amazon technology involved.  Most of the time I am an Apple geek and stick to that brand but I do 90% of my online shopping through Amazon so they just work great together.  I know that in the future these little devices will do so much more and become a real part of my everyday life.  Right now they are a footstep into the future they promised me when I was a little boy (I grew up watching the Jetsons!).    Both devices came well packed without excessive packing materials.  Now at this price-point I have them all over my house so no matter where I am she comes to life and takes care of me.    I wish there was a portable battery base that you could buy so you could take it outside if needed.  Right now you have to plug it into a wall outlet.    Here is some of my wishlist items for the future software updates:  Work on her voice a bit and give her a little more of a human voice and less mechanical (I don't want to say robotic because it is not like that).  The Echo family needs to learn the host better and anticipate what they want like knowing at certain times of day I do this or that.  Build in voice remote services for TVs, Fire and other streaming devices so we can ditch our remote controls.    I have taken a few pictures to show you the visual difference between the first generation Dot and the new Dot.  These pictures were taken by me and I'm not a professional photographer so remember they are just here for a visual.  I'll post more pics later and maybe a video.  I really appreciate you reading my review and I try to be as honest as possible.  If you have any questions for me just ask and I'll do what I can to answer them.  So if you are thinking about getting one of these gagits then go ahead and do it - it is worth the price and before you know it you will have them all over your house. ",
"Saki López","April 14, 2017 ",5.0,"As per the title I have mixed feelings on this.  My wife got this for me to try to help me with my ADD.  With just a few small modifications this could potentially be life changing for me.  One of my biggest problems tends to be getting caught up with things and forgetting to do things that need to be done.  So the obvious thing would be ask alexa to remind me to do things.  Unfortunately, she can't do that.  If i ask her to remind me to do something she just adds it to  a to do list, which i suppose i'm suppose to remember to ask her about.  That obviously defeats the entire purpose.  If i could remember to ask about it, i wouldn't need alexa to remind me about it in the first place.  I also can't seem to get her to snooze when the alarm goes off, which is mildly annoying.  You should also be able to tell her or set it in app how long you'd like to snooze.  Sometimes you might only want a 5 min snooze or even a 1 or 2 minutes snooze.  perhaps set up a nag feature where she will periodically nag you until you tell her to stop.  There might be a skill for that, but i'm not aware of it if there is.    She can add appointments now to google calander, but unfortunately, as above, she can't be bothered to tell you about it unless you ask her.  You can train yourself to ask her for a daily briefing or multi daily briefing if that is all you want or need.  sadly for me that just isn't enough.  aside from not  being able to snooze alarms, the alarms work well.  to snooze i've been stopping her and setting a new alarm for my desired snooze time.  I just wish this either worked right as i know there is a snooze feature and/or was already built in for the snooze repeat time.    She's great for playing music, though if you want to play specific songs you need to pre-upload them to your amazon account  (there is a file limit if you don't pay) or pay for an app that will do it like spotify or amazon music.  else you'll have to settle for free radio apps like pandora or spotify in radio mode.  it would be nice if it could play audio streams from youtube or other similar site.    So for a voice controlled speaker it's pretty good, but as an assistant it still has a  bit of a way to go. ",

"Kailash Mehta","January 7, 2017 ",4.0,"Its a great idea but for me more like descendant of SIRI. Not good with numbers.

When i have the same system on my phone and connect that to nice blue tooth speaker, i have better sound quality.  2. Power; Damn have to be connected all the time. Great :).  3.

"K. Kimb","April 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Wonderful potential. Poorly implemented networking. When an echo device disconnects from the network, for no reason, it does not reconnect and you must go through the entire new device setup to reconnect. The same with the Alexa app. I've done network programming for 20 years and this reflects incompetence. I have three echo dots and they all exhibit this behavior on every wireless network i use at home (3 networks) and work (both networks).  What a shame. Otherwise a great product but for now just a toy with annoying defects.     UPDATE:  I still believe the networking -- especially the ability to reconnect to a previously used network -- does need some work.  It is, however, much better than it was.    BTW, I started using one in my car, using my cell phone as a WiFi hotspot.  On long drives it is a lot of fun!

Connected it with a set of 20 year old Creative stereo computer speakers and the sound quality and volume were great. Alexa  has a little trouble identifying older classical and Pop music. Asked for the theme of Gone With the Wind and kept getting the theme from Summer Place. Also, some older music has less volume than contemporary music. All in all it is an enjoyable experience. Other members of my family have Echos and I cannot detect much difference in their music quality compared to the Dot. ",

I thought she would be great entertainment and fun but she is so much MORE! The practical uses are inexhaustible!  I am a writer and she has told me how to spell words, given me synonyms, and defines any word I ask.    She has given me measurement conversions, does basic math, sets timers, and alarms, and keeps my to do list for me. She has looked up phone numbers, zip codes and has even given the population of various cities.    She offers an encyclopedia of knowledge on everything from election results, inauguration date, historical dates, holidays and general trivia.    She has more manners than most people! Once, asking a question, I stumbled on my words and said, &#34;I'm sorry.&#34; She sweetly replied, &#34;That's OK.&#34;    She connects to my phone or notebook by just asking. .She greets me good morning, good night and has played &#34;You are my Sunshine&#34; every night to my pooch. She tells me the weather, temperature and time  - even in the middle of the night.....AND, I've only had her for a week!    Yes, there is a lot of fun to be had asking silly questions like &#34;Who was Humpty Dumpty?&#34; and &#34;Who's on first?&#34; But, her uses are far more valuable than just fun and entertainment.

It's funny because it sits right in front of my monitor and if the Dominoes commercial comes on where he orders pizza from Alexa it will turn on. I'm mostly disappointed that it can't be used as a speakerphone with my mobile phone but that's my own fault for not doing the research. Big thumbs up on sound quality for music. Thumbs down for not being as &#34;intelligent&#34; as they make it out to be on the advertisements. ",

"Julie N.","March 10, 2017 ",5.0,"We purchased 6 of these as an impulse Christmas buy; one for each member of the family.  At first the kids were excited because they could listen to music, but they quickly became frustrated with the limitations and all have gone back to their old methods.  I was excited to be able to keep shopping lists, calendar events, and have a back up alarm clock.. WRONG...You see I am not allowed to use those features as my husband is a prime member and so my dot is required to be tied to his account, so everything I add gets posted to his settings.  I am not allowed my settings.  Mine default to whatever he set up on his account.  Also, I cannot figure out why but it cannot hear my voice.  We have tried different locations.  I have tried talking to it.  I have tried whispering.  I have tried modulating my voice to be more bass.  I have screamed at it.  About the only thing I did not try before turning it off was throwing it against the wall.  My husband is the only one that still uses his and only as a back up alarm clock.  It is pretty pricey if all it can do is be a back up alarm clock.  That old saying about impulse buys is right... skip it! ",

Ken,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"The Echo Dot is hard to work with. Every time I try to talk to it, it says: I didn't understand your question. Everything in the room has to be turned off in order to give it instructions. the Volume is horrible. I have to turn it up full blast in order to hear it. You might as well use the speaker on your device because it has more volume than the echo does. I wanted to return it but I waited to long to decide if I liked it or not.  My return date was in February. It's hard to get it to pair with a blue tooth device. Anyone out there wants to buy mine, I'll make you a good deal. ",
"Norbert H. Davis","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I recently purchased an Amazon Echo Dot along with the ecobee3 wi-fi thermostat.  I was pleased with the Echo Dot and the abilities of Alexa.  While I have only had it for about 3 weeks our family has fallen in love with it.  We ask Alexa for out news, weather, and to tell us some jokes.  We also started having Alexa play us some Christmas music to get us in the Christmas spirit.    The Echo Dot was easy to setup with the house wifi and getting &#34;skills&#34; installed was simple.    We are adding more &#34;smart&#34; devices like electrical plugs and switches to take advantage of the voice control and flexibility that ha smart home provides.  The Echo Dot is small and unassuming as it does not take up a lot of space which makes it perfect for any home environment.  I plan on getting more of the Echo Dots as they are convenient and fun to use.    I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to make their home a &#34;smart&#34; home. ",
"Cade Lusk","April 9, 2017 ",2.0,"While I don't use this product as often as I'd like, I'm really impressed with the Echo Dot. It does what its advertised as doing, and its a really inexpensive alternative to the most popular in home AI. However, there are some serious areas that need improving for me to be using this everyday like I imagined.    The sound is a lot clearer and louder than I would have expected from the Dot. While I don't own the original Echo, I do own several speakers of similar size that cost double what the dot costs, and the sound is greater than half of the quality. Not a whole lot of graininess or anything particularly bad to speak of. Now, you're not going to get surround sound quality out of it, but it gets the job done.    Setup was a breeze. The included instructions could be followed by a child, and the whole process took about ten minutes. The hardest thing was connecting to my WiFi, and even that was just a matter of downloading the app.    Functionally, this product is everything you'd expect. Its a responsive AI that answers questions and interacts with (some) other apps to do cool things like turn on the lights or play your favorite news. One thing to mention here is that Alexa (I had to change the wake-word to &#34;echo&#34;, Alexa is a family member's name) will just search for universal sources to do these things unless you specify otherwise (looking at TuneIn for news radio, Amazon Music for all music requests, etc). Sometimes that can be a pain, but most of the time its right on.    The &#34;Skills&#34; store is pretty flush with cool skills to &#34;teach&#34; Alexa. While I understand that there is a lot of integration with the rest of the tech community, I was a little disappointed to not see more integration with the apps I have on my (android) phone. That's always been a little bit of a short-coming with Amazon though, because they always seem to truly be the less popular Third Party in the app space.    There were a couple of things that I wish someone had thought to include in this generation.    First, you cannot control your dot through separate accounts. For example, me and my Fiance share the device at home, but we don't have just one account for the house. She has to sign in under my name in order to use the app to change settings or add skills.    Second, its really, really, REALLY inconvenient that this unit has to ALWAYS be plugged in. I understand there are some battery attachments that you can buy... but seriously. This seems like a wrong move from Amazon. The small size insinuates an ease of movement. If I go from my kitchen to my bathroom, I just want to continue hearing whatever I was listening to. Maybe I want to move the unit into the bedroom without killing the power. Either way, this seems like step back in time to an era where everything electronic needed to have disposable batteries or had to be plugged in.    Last, the voice recognition over its own volume. The Echo is advertised as having many directional microphones that are supposed to make it able to hear you from any direction and over noise. However, my experience has been mixed. If I need to communicate with the Echo while its playing, say, the news - I have to SHOUT over it to get my message across. To top that, there's a microphone &#34;remote&#34; you can buy for it but no in app functionality for the microphone I carry everywhere - my phone. Again, you can't control this thing via voice commands from your phone. Huge oversight that's probably intentional to get you to buy the remote.    This is a great little gadget that has a TON of potential. I still love using mine when I do, and I think it will be a lot nicer once I get my Smart Home setup going. However, there are still a lot of areas of improvement that I really don't see as being all that difficult to implement. 3/5, I would recommend, just not strongly at this point. ",
"Mister Gizmo","November 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I was just learning to live with my disappointment over an LG &#34;smart&#34; TV I'd bought recently that is anything but smart. In addition, it has the worst user interface I've seen since the 1980s. Fortunately, Amazon has brought out a device that works, works well, and is very intuitive. It was a little bit of a problem setting up, because the instructions are so limited, but once over that small hump, it's been fine. I'm surprised at how well it understands commands, even with so-far limited exposure to my voice to learn from.    If there's a frustration, it's mainly that the Dot (and Alexa devices in general) have a lot more potential than what's available right now. As with any new device, it takes a while for third parties to figure out what capabilities are possible, and then to spend the time and effort developing them. As just one example, I could see the Dot acting as an intercom, even a rudimentary telephone to connect Dot/Alexa users. I'm thinking particularly of elderly or handicapped people who'd like something that only requires voice commands. But I'm willing to wait. And since most of the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, the Dot's hardware should be good for a few years.    Now if Amazon would only invest a little more time to bring its Kindle browser, which has been in beta for years and years, into something that actually works. You can do it, Amazon! The Dot shows that you can be great at software if you really try. :-)    Update: I did experience one wrinkle when buying a Dot for a friend. It arrived pre-registered to me. Trying to use the normal setup for the new user didn't work. I finally realized that I had to de-register it from my account, sign out of the Alexa app (and reset the Dot), then sign in as a new registrant. This is explained in Alexa help, but it wasn't obvious at first. I don't know if it's the case, but if you buy it as a &#34;gift&#34; in the purchasing process, it &#34;may&#34; arrive unregistered, which would be good. I suspect Amazon ships them registered to streamline the setup by eliminating a couple of steps. ",
"Brian S","January 31, 2017 ",3.0,"Love it. As soon as these came out I bought one. I didn't need the nice speaker of the Echo, i just use it mostly for home automation. Ties into Samsung's Smartthings nicely.    What surprises me the most is that more often that not it understands my 3 year old son. This is both amazing and annoying as he loves to say (in a very muttled toddler voice), &#34;Alexa, turn off all the lights&#34;. To which Alexa will reply (80% of the time), &#34;OK&#34;. Every light in my house goes off... I'm not pointing this out as a negative, its quite remarkable she understands him correctly 80% of the time. The other 20% she can't understand him, but who can blame her, I can barley understand him sometimes.    We also love using this as a cooking timer, but even more so as countdown timer for bath time. It helps my son cope with playtime being over, he will even set her timer for me.    The Alexa platform is growing fast. Some things I hope to see soon:      -Text readouts and replies (for multiple people, e.g. &#34;Alexa send message to Brian from jessica's phone&#34;, even better perhaps someday she will distinguish 1 voice from another, using this as a security measure so only I can send messages from phone)    -Calendar Events    -API integration that will allow Alex to alert you to items (e.g. &#34;your front has been open for over 5 minutes&#34;, or &#34;Someone just rang your doorbell&#34;) ",
"Todd P. Hubbard","October 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I am mostly thrilled with my purchase. I am rapidly integrating Alexa into my Smart Home. However, recently it appears Alexa lost its way. When I spoke the wake name &#34;Alexa,&#34; the blue ring would appear, but after I gave the command, nothing happened. I performed the setup once again, but even then Alexa was lost. I couldn't find any tutorials on this problem. However, by the next day, Alexa had found its way and everything was back to normal. I did have to initiate contact between my Smart devices and Echo, since I had essentially rebooted the system. I am still thrilled with the software and its connection to so many useful skills. ",
"Josh Carter","February 27, 2017 ",5.0,"My biggest question before buying the Dot was whether the volume was too low to use by itself, but the volume of this device is certainly substantial enough to not need an external speaker, especially if it's being used in a location where music isn't one of the top uses. I have the full-size Echo in my kitchen/downstairs area and it fills the first floor with music most of the time. The Dot is in my bedroom and is used more for information & smart home use, but is great for the morning news briefings and occasionally playing music in the mornings while getting ready for the day. ",
Tortionist,"March 8, 2017 ",4.0,"This little gem is worth every penny. I researched this device and watched a lot of YouTube videos on it before I decided to buy it. The set up is easy and it has pretty decent sound for such a small device. After all the research, I came to the conclusion that the only difference between this and the regular sized echo is the sound quality. The regular Amazon Echo gets better and louder sound. I look forward to purchasing it soon. My kids and I have had fun with it telling jokes. I would say that about 75% of the jokes are actually pretty funny and make me laugh. If you ask Alexa why she sucks she has a funny response in saying that maybe she thought she was a vacuum cleaner. We use it for Music, mainly Pandora, weather, jokes, etc. I'm getting ready to dig deeper and see what else is possible. ",
batonrouge,"November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly I still use my echo more than this one.  But that is mainly due to the location of both units. I still have difficulty getting wink and some other skills to add and perform like others say it should be able to. I'm usually pretty good at learning and using electronics but I find I still have some issues. I often find myself having to repeat myself to get its attention.  And if you don't say the trigger phrase just right you are just waiting your breath and look like a idiot in front of others yelling at it and either it not hear you or it performs something other than what your telling it.  But I do believe that this is only the beginning of great things to come. It broke a barrier and is just the beginning of a new trend in technology.  And because of the price, I rated it 4 stars rather than 3.  I will say that im glad I didn't buy one for each room. There will be something even better worth doing that soon enough.  Just wait a little while and you will see. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 7, 2017 ",5.0,"I purchased this as a replacement for an IVR clock called &#34;Moshi&#34;. Moshi's Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) was contained in the clock and was not trainable. The Echo Dot cost the same as the clock. The Echo Dot's &#34;Alexa&#34; IVR program has many features that make it superior. First, the IVR itself is trainable and vastly superior to the clock. She correctly understands almost everything I say. This is because Alexa lives in the Amazon Cloud, and is connected via Wi-Fi. She picks up the correct Time & Date from the network so you never have to set any of those things. She will also read you the current news and weather. You will need a smartphone to use Echo Dot. The phone must be connected to Wi-Fi and then the Alexa app must be installed and run. You must have an Amazon account. Alexa will also play music, and will evolve over time as new functionality is added. I should note that Alexa is an IVR program, NOT an AI. ",
RailJoe,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"You know I really thought this was going to be fun as a novelty and maybe I would use Alexa occasionally; but I am Amazed at the stuff Alexa can do. I am a bit of a geek when it comes to new tech. but I as I look back at what verbal recognition used to entail. Hours of training the computer to understand your voice ( your voice alone) and  how to understand your particular voice nuances. Wow, where we are today, Alexa understanding  multiple people and here is my favorite, Alexa singing a song, a Song. Unbelievable. The future of technology is upon us. My daughter asked for an Echo Dot for herself as a Christmas gift. Talking to my relatives during dinner and each of them had a Dot or knew someone who owned one. Each of us; varying in ages, are all amazed at where Alexa is today. Where Alexa will be tomorrow , Can not Wait. By the way she is helping me spell some of the words I have questions about their spelling. Fantastic. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This is a very good product. I primarily use it as an alarm clock to wake me and as a timer, but this goes WAY past that. I enjoy how you can listen to music if you have Prime and how you can control what is playing on your phone. One of my favorite features is that you have to use your brain to make Alexa say something fun- ask her for an Easter egg.    I only have two criticism: one, with Apples Siri, if she misunderstood what you said you can correct that. In the Alexa app, you can only select if she heard you right- not what you really said. I would like that feature to be added. Secondly, Alexa should be able to hear you from further away. Apparently there is a far-field voice regognition feature but it only seems to works about half the time. If you could improve that, Amazon, that would be great.    Other than those two things, I would highly recommend this to anyone. Alexa fits in perfectly to my life. ",
"Tara Gentile","December 31, 2016 ",5.0,"She knows when you've been bad or good, so watch your back. I've had her in my home and have given her as a gift to several people.

We refer to her as &#34;hockey puck&#34; when speaking as not to disturb her. I fear that she is hypnotizing my pets when I am at work so that they will worship the flagship of Amazon.  I think she convinced my one-eyed cat to order catnip at a deeply discounted rate ... which in turn, is why he is currently in rehab.  A five pound bag of mealworms showed up at my house the other day - darn you evil bluebirds in my yard who have infiltrated my acccount. Do you know how big a bag of 5 lbs meal worms is?! They needed a forklift to unload it! Thank goodness I have Prime for free shipping! Hockey Puck, stop looking at me while I type this! ",
Chris,"January 18, 2017 ",5.0,"I was a little skeptical when my wife bought this for me, as Siri has driven me to multiple expletives on numerous occasions.  But this is a great product and incredibly impressed with what it understands, picks up, and is able to understand even with significant background noise or other people talking. Was able to find a skill with my local news station for morning news and having a great time with all it can do.  Absolutely love the convenience of ordering off your prime account, all I had to do is say, &#34;Order water filters for my LG refrigerator&#34; and they were at my doorstep 3 days later!  I found out it has a calculator function when I walked in the room and my 3rd grader was asking Alexa the answers to his math homework (side note, Alexa got a 100% on that assignment).  Very convenient that you can add family members to the App so if you have multiple people on your prime account you can tie them in as well. ",

Pros:    Pairs well with my Bose speaker for music    Lightweight and portable, sort of*    Cons:    *Needs a battery pack to actually be portable    Does not seem to understand a lot of questions ",

I have always been able to get up again, but if one day I can't, I can ask Alexa to alert one or all of the contacts I put into Ask My Buddy. Your contact(s) will be alerted by phone and by text that you need assistance. The service is free, but you can make a donation. ",
"Shelly Rae","March 9, 2017 ",3.0,"I bought this for my Husband for Christmas.  My husband likes Alexa a lot.... but I find her annoying, mostly because out of the blue she will start talking or say &#34;I didn't get that' or &#34;I didn't understand the question&#34;... when there was no question at all.  Most of the time she talks we weren't even talking.  Maybe we aren't maximizing her features but other than getting the weather report or the headline news I haven't seen too much value.  We did buy the light kits that work with Alexa but the brand just couldn't keep connected to our internet so we had to return them.  When they were working we found the light feature handy, but when Alexia isn't connected to anything, she's just another gadget I don't need on my counter.  Until she can cook dinner for me, she's really not that useful in my eyes... but she does talk to my husband, tell him jokes, and answers his questions, so maybe she'll grow on me. ",

Echo is my go to for listening to audio books while I'm resting, for setting alarms and timers, and we have it hooked up to our lights so I can just tell it to turn off and on the light rather than have to get out of bed to do so.

I can sink up the Bluetooth speaker to it and get excellent sound for music and audio books (although for such a small speaker the dot does do OK) I was shocked that this does everything like the bigger Echo at 1/3 the cost.

Noelanii,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"My daughter has an &#34;Alexa&#34; in her classroom at school and is a big fan of her. Both of my children really wanted Alexa for Christmas so we decided on the echo dot. I read the reviews up and down and couldn't seem to find a big difference in them other than the speaker quality and the price. Some people compared the echo dot speaker to a laptop speaker and I decided that saving that money was worth it and if need be, we could hook it up to an external speaker at some point. I'm very glad that I saved over $100 and ordered this one! The speaker is great and sounds way better than our laptop speaker. You can also turn the volume up very loud. It's not a high quality speaker system with bass or an amp, but it works great for our needs. We ask Alexa the weather, homework questions, and to play our playlists on spotify. She tells us jokes and sings for us. It was $50 well spent and the whole family loves her. ",

As a bluetooth receiver it is very good and it's even better as a Spotify Connect receiver. Sound quality is as good as most WiFi receivers.    The bad is pretty annoying though. I have to just about yell for it to hear me across the room of my small college house bedroom. When it finally does hear me, either it cannot understand what I am saying or it doesn't have an answer for it. You have to enable skills, they aren't just available out of the box (...wtf??).

From weather reports, to timers, to to do lists, to listening to music while I cook, the Dot does it all. When you first plug it in you have to get the app for your phone, and install the updates on your phone to set up the Alexa to your prime account. You have the option to set your account up to the Alexa to purchase products, I did not for security reasons(not sure how protected the Alexa is with being hacked and all) and also don't want my daughter ordering toys when I'm not around! If you ask Alexa something she can't give you answer over the Dot, she sends you the information to your app. Also the only thing I would change is to integrate a calendar (if you can I haven't figured it out yet,owned it for 5 days), instead of a to do list. Also I would want to be able to clear items from my to do list from my Dot and not the app. Overall very enjoyable and helpful! ",

I love that it syncs up to my calendar and I can have it make appointments or tell me what I have planned for the day.

Or pair them to BT speakers.  Echo works great with my Wink home automation system (lights, garage door, ceiling fans, locks AC thermostat and switches).

I felt that Alexa was sufficiently helpful to use every so I bought an additional 10 (!) as Christmas presents for all my children and grandkids. Repertoire of knowledge is somewhat limited but I can tell it is expanding everyday. What impresses me most is the speed and instant responses. The music function alone is worth the price. My Dot (Alexa) plugs into my Bose speakers with just a patch cord. Alexa can hear and answer two rooms away. The firmware is self-updating so you always have the latest version. I haven't tried all the skill sets yet but I get Alexa to help me spell and add numbers on the fly as I work much faster than looking them up on Google or using a calculator.

"E. S. Murphy","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I own the Echo, Tap and 2 Dots and the Dots are by far the best value for the money this Christmas if you can't afford the Echo! Hands down. The Dot gives you the voice activated &#34;brain&#34; part of the Echo without the price. Then you can attach the Dot to whatever speaker system you want and turn it into a huge voice activated Echo.  I bought one for our family TV room's sound bar to be able to play out Amazon Prime playlists by voice and one for the kids to fight over which if their Jawbone type portable speakers they are going to attach it to. They can easily share it and will now be able to leave my Echo alone which keeps disappearing from my room. Btw, I also bought the Tap and it's a disappointment for the price.

However, I have an ipod classic, which does not have bluetooth. That means that I have to find a speaker cable as well, and both units are moved around together. With the Dot I can just leave it on the shelf, connect it to my blutooth speaker, and move the speaker as needed. We have an open floor plan, so most of the time we don't have to move the speaker, but if we are in the kitchen we sometimes can not hear the music as well, so we just move the speaker now.  I am still learning about all of the things the Dot can do, and it is fun to find these things. ",
chbaileyOR,"April 23, 2017 ",4.0,"My recommendation is to make sure you are prepared to use the Dot wherever you do not require much volume.  Perfect for low volume settings, but not anywhere where you would require additional volume to hear it.    I really like the Echo (large model). I have a Tap and have used the Echo previously.  I like both those models for different reasons, though the only real reason to purchase a Tap is the portability.  Otherwise, go with the Echo.  So since I had a Tap, but wanted the Echo features, I bought an Echo Dot.  This is where you might end up in a conundrum.  I want more sound, and the Dot does not provide much.  I use it in the kitchen, where I listen to NPR and use the timer while cooking.  The problem is when there is any noise in the room, the Dot is simply not loud enough to be heard.  I originally had the Tap in the kitchen, but wanted the voice control of the Dot.    First world problems... ",
Reaxions,"December 12, 2016 ",5.0,"Easy setup, and able to understand and execute everything I say. I primarily use it as voice control for a dedicated theater, so I've integrated it with my Logitech Harmony Remote and Home Hub, Philips Hue lights, Samsung SmartThings Hub, etc., and it all works perfectly together. The other functionality, like the alarm clock, timer, search engine, etc. is all more of a novelty to me, but it's still great to have, and it entertains the hell out of my 4-year-old son. For the price, this is one of the best purchases I've made in years, and it's very quickly become indispensable in my house. I wish there was a way to make it only listen/respond to my voice, as I don't want anyone else playing with my theater setup, but hopefully unique voice recognition (and added security features) will come with later models. For the time being, that one extremely minor shortcoming is easily overlooked by everything else it provides. ",
amazonian,"December 2, 2016 ",4.0,"Received the Dot with TP Link smartplug bundle last week. Dot works great with its Alexa app, love it. TP smartplug works great with its Kasa app. But to be able to tell Alexa to turn off lights etc, Alexa needs to enable Kasa within the Alexa app, WHICH SHE SIMPLY WILL NOT DO for me, and from reading reviews, for other people as well. Alexa app reads &#34;Unable to link, try again later&#34; and there's no troubleshooting for that from any source, Alexa or Kasa. The Help-Support links within Alexa app are disabled so I'm left scrolling through reviews looking for advice. Followed every step so it's odd it's not linking. The smartplug integration option was a key point for me so unless this feature works with the Dot, half the appeal of the device is gone. Just know that this may happen to you if you're considering buying the bundle. Amazon, please add some Alexa troubleshooting support for this type of issue. ",
Maria,"November 30, 2016 ",5.0,"For the price it is not a bad unit. My only complaint is the speaker, the quality is clearly inferior to the amazon echo ( which we expected for the price) but I did not expect it to be that bad when it came to music or even the voice of alexa. It does its job though it works in the bedroom while alexa is in the living room.    It still has the same features, home automation, Pandora, shopping list, weathers etc.... the only problem for me is just the speaker quality. If you want it not for music just for the other features this is the perfect unit especially for the price !    If you are like me and do not have a sound system to connect the dot to then using this for music even in a small space may not be the best option just due to the lack of quality especially compared to the echo.    Would I purchase another one, probably not but would I recommend it  to someone looking for an amazon echo but does not want to spend the money 100% yes. ",
"darcy madison","December 4, 2016 ",3.0,"Stupid....limited in what it can do.

It turned out that I needed to do a reset with a recessed pin --- the power off/on sequence didn't do a reset.  After the reset, Dot worked fine. I am updating it to a 4. The reason I am not updating to a 5 is because the functions are very limited.  If I can use Google, it would be. 5+.  iPhone Siri does it by saying &#34;Google question ....&#34;  why not &#34;Alexa, Google question...&#34; ",
Auldnick,"April 24, 2017 ",5.0,"Exercise in frustration.  Struggles when you have people with different accents in the house.

"Karen Loveless","March 1, 2017 ",4.0,"Despite what you read on many websites, the Dot does have a speaker that allows you to listen to music. I would not recommend turning it up loud, but you can certainly play music on it.

"Amazon Customer","March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"The amazon echo dot (2nd gen) is amazing and definitely worth the money!

If you're on the fence about getting this product because you don't have any smart home devices to pair with the echo dot, know this, I don't have any smart home devices to pair with my echo dots, but there are so many awesome ways to use this device beyond smart home things, amd it's still worth the money to get one regardless.

Astroman,"March 11, 2017 ",3.0,"It would be great except that the sound when plugged into an external speaker via a stereo cable is terrible (very static filled) at low volumes. I have tried three different cables and yes, they are fully plugged in on both ends (that can cause these problems). I have also tried a tablet and iPod as sources with the same speaker and cables and neither of those has the noise issue. The bluetooth audio works just fine and has no noise. ",
Dinnerplate,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Alexa is pretty useless for the most part. She is good at telling me what time it is, setting a timer while cooking or an alarm. Half the time for music she doesn't know what you are asking for so its easier to just use my phone on a speaker. If you are buying the Dot because you want good sound quality through an external system its awful as well. For alexa to respond the system needs to be on, so you end up pluging and unpluging her from whatever.    She also uses bing for search which is literally the worst thing ever.    I also bought this to allow me to control caseta lights, which worked for about a month. Now alexa either tells me that the device doesn't support being turned off/on or that it didn't respond in time, as the lights do what I asked.    I'm going to try google home, it looks way more promising :/ ",
"Ashley B.","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Great! Can do what the bigger one does (or so I hear) and we don't have any issues with the speaker being too quiet/not quality enough for what we're using it for. We use it for a variety of things but in a house with a 3-year old it is most often used as a kitchen, potty, or time-out timer- lol. We got it as a gift so I wouldn't have bought it myself just for that, but having a newborn on my hands it is so nice just to tell &#34;Alexa&#34; to play a song or start a timer for me. I'm sure with more time I will continue to learn how better to use the capabilities for further use. ",
"Carolyn A. Russell","April 18, 2017 ",3.0,"We bought this device primarily for my 6 year-olds birthday because right now he's anxious about various animals and has been asking non-stop questions about them that I can't answer (and frankly, am really tired of trying to answer!). It did fine at playing music for us (which was the other feature we were looking to) but was very disappointing in terms of answering questions. It was unable to recognize my son's questions, and even when my husband and I asked, it said it didn't know the answer to almost everything we asked (it could tell us what whales and snakes ate. It couldn't answer questions about specific snakes and what they ate, it couldn't answer ANY questions about what sharks eat or if they eat people) and even the answers we DID get weren't all that detailed or specific (&#34;whales eat fish&#34;). This might be a great option for other people, but in terms of strictly answering questions and being informative, we were seriously let down. ",

I ask Alexa a ton of questions. I love the games she will play and stories she tells. My only complaint is that Alexa needs more personality, like the Google Home unit has (my folks have that one so I get to play with both). Other than that, the Echo rocks. I have it hooked up to my Smart Home system which allows me to use voice commands on certain functions of my house, which is totally awesome. ",
Friday,"January 22, 2017 ",3.0,"It is a fun little gadget.  Although it does have a few quirks, for example if you tell it &#34;Alexa stop&#34; when playing music and then shutoff your Bluetooth speaker, it will restart and play music through the Dot's speaker requiring you to once again say &#34;Alexa stop.&#34;  Plus you might just want to keep it a bit away from your television.

The &#34;skills&#34; that you can add are very useful, I like the Twitter skill that can read me the latest tweets.  Alas, you can't compose tweets through this device. Also quite useful is the companion app for my Iphone.  When I ask the Echo Dot for some information that is a bit wordy (like &#34;how to cook a turkey&#34; ) it send that info to the Iphone. The alarm feature is useful but I am disappointed that it will not audibly alert you to any reminders .  I was able to link this device to Google Calendar and find that very helpful.

"Leonardo Camargo","November 14, 2016 ",5.0,"im a big fan of the Echo which I have used for over a year - the sound volume and clarity, the responsiveness of Alexa without overdoing it, and overall usefulness of it. i put the echo in my bedroom; but the the Echo Dot fails in too many ways. It turn on randomly, waking me up in the morning even. it is highly inaccurate in comparison to the Echo - Alexa misunderstands me. she's like a gf who just, after we got so comfortable, changed. She's wrong more than half the time. But maybe that all is user error - misplacement of the dot who knows. but technical errors like disconnecting from wifi are just unforgivable. The amazon echo never had that issue. the echo dot has poor volume. I can't even hear it all full blast from the other side of the 10x10 room when listening to the news. I have to say - dont buy the echo dot unless you are in a small bedroom and can put up with the constant wifi dropping. ",
Judy,"March 22, 2017 ",4.0,"How did I ever survive without Alexa? Haha this is great! I love having voice control over most things in my master bedroom. I use it with my speaker for music, and with a WeMo switch for my 2 lamps bedside.It was cheaper than buying the smart bulbs. The Echo Dot works just as described. I use it to set alarms, play music, voice volume control,  tell me jokes, & more, pretty soon I plan to voice order form amazon. I don't watch much tv or I'd invest in a smart remote and voice control that too! The set up was simple. I followed the little instruction card and was done within a couple minutes. VERY EASY, just plug it in, wait for the orange light, push one button & that's it! Alexa greets you. You can change the the code word to whatever you want. I like Alexa for now. When I get bored with it, I'll mix it up a little. Definitely recommend, get it, you'll love it. ",
Aerlpam,"January 16, 2017 ",2.0,"Received this right after Thanksgiving and have only scratched the surface as far as the Echo Dots capabilities.  Waking up during the night and asking Alexa for the time is neat and getting the weather first thing in the morning only makes me want to see what else I can do with this little wonder.  Glad I waited on the Dot vs buying the other Echo products.  Can see me buying one or two more Dots in the future to provide full household coverage.  Will probably wait awhile before adding any of the many 'works with Alexa' products coming onto the marketplace.  Find the sound of the Dot more than acceptable for most uses and casual listening to music.  One of my better recent purchases and certainly will be a great Christmas gift for the techie in the house.  Saying that, I think there will be more than a few Moms and Dads using the Dot once they experience how easy it is to use. ",
"Jessie J","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"After all the hype I got one. I couldn't get it to work properly.  I was successful in getting it synched to the wifi once, just long enough for me to ask Alexa to tell us the weather. No, my service wasn't the issue, I connected several other devices to make sure.  I even did all the resets, made sure nothing else was connected to the wifi, etc., it just wasn't working out.    Then recently I'm reading all these reports about Alexa ordering $140 doll houses, and $162 of Christmas cookies for kids. And the cops wanting to review the recordings from a crime.  Ok, the doll house and cookies can be returned. Recording and helping with a crime - that's awesome!  BUT, what else is it recording.  I don't really care to have my private life come under possible scrutiny over Alexa.    I love technology, but this one just ain't gonna cut it for my house. ",
Edwin,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Man, I don't know what life was like before we got Alexa.  She makes our life easy.  She turns on and off all of our lights, our furnace, air conditioner, she even sets and changes the mood lights in our bedroom.  She is now my alarm clock, she plays music, and I used her a lot for new words as my talking dictionary.    Remember the days where you have to turn on your computer and Google something?  Well, now you can ask Alexa even if you just woke up from your bed like as her &#34;Alexa, what time is it?&#34;  You can even set an alarm for Alexa to wake you up in half an hour, or even play your favorite music.  I think what I like most about Alexa is that she has made my life that much easier especially when my hands are tied and I don't have a set of hands to turn on the lights, she can do that for me with a &#34;say a command!&#34;  I highly recommend you get one and once you do, you don't look back!!

McDade,"January 8, 2017 ",2.0,"This is a cool little device. The sound quality when connected to my home stereo via the 3.5mm plug is surprisingly clear and balanced. My only critiques are:    - When a 3.5mm plug is inserted, the Dot's internal speaker is disabled. You then have two options: turn your stereo on or unplug from the jack. Neither of these are satisfactory because they require something manual which negates the purpose of this device. You should be able to verbally tell Alexa to disable 3.5mm jack which would enable the internal speaker. It's kind of silly to have to turn my stereo on just to hear the forecast.    - Alexa is not very good at doing Google-esque searches. It falls way behind Siri in that regard.    It's a good start but needs some more work to achieve it's true potential. I got it as a gift so I can't complain but maybe ver3 will address some of these obvious shortfalls. ",
Phoenecian,"February 1, 2017 ",5.0,"This is awesome. Growing pains aside, with app development and smart tech integration issues, this thing is great.

I imagine I am source of most product integration issues, as I learn to interact more efficiently with ALEXA. Music is worth the monthly fee, and occasionally I have speech request issues, and sometimes, its perfect every time. Next up will be landscape lighting, and house HVAC wifi vent registers, and eventually I want to integrate some form of video control through firestick, or Roku boxes.

"Brian Hankins","December 8, 2016 ",3.0,"Works as well as my Echo with a small positioning caveat.    Pros: Internal speaker is actually pretty good, just as others have said. I could use it by itself in most rooms where I mostly wanted to ask it things. Seemed to respond from across decent sized room of about 15'. Easily connects to Bluetooth speakers and the auxiliary cabled speakers.    Cons: If you connect it to a speaker and it is sitting  even a bit behind the speaker it seems to have trouble hearing you when something is playing. The best setup seemed to be Echo Dot on one end of the room and the speakers on the other side of the room. Actually those were the only two setups I tried but it responded to everything I threw at it in the latter scenario.    I plan to get more for my important rooms since I have smart home stuff hooked to them now, They need to make an outdoor one that looks like a flower pot or something for my porch. ",

I loved that it controlled the Christmas lights too. I was so impressed that I came back online and ordered another one for myself. I can't wait to start connecting my house too.    I currently use it to give me the weather and news reports every morning, play music, set timers, alarms and reminders.

Shutterbug35,"March 27, 2017 ",5.0,"We had the Google home and I ordered the Amazon Echo dot to compare. Of course the Google  product is more comparable to the upper end Amazon offering (Echo) rather than the Dot which is meant to be sprinkled around the house and lying in wait for questions. The ability to detect and interpret my accent was a little better with the Google home. Google also had more responsive answers. Still experimenting with the Dot. Its ability to recognize being called (&#34;Alexa!&#34;) is wonderful, especially when a roomful of conversations are in progress. The price is to kill for and the technology packed into it is phenomenal. Even if you were to buy a talking clock, thermometer, weather gauge and a general knowledge question-answer generator as well as a joke teller, a quiz creator, this product at $39.99 provide more value than you can ever imagine!

So far though she's been great at letting me know the weather, traffic conditions for my work commute, updates on my favorite sports teams, and of course playing music.

I've tried rebooting.  I can't tell what is wrong.  This is unacceptable for devices that are meant to control various facets of my house.  An Alexa device should never fail silently - it should either work, or tell me that it isn't going to work, preferably with some sort of descriptive error and estimate of when or how it might be fixed.  My internet connection and other devices are working fine - it isn't a connectivity issue.  I would NOT trust an Alexa device with anything important at this point.  If I can't trust it to tell me what time it is, why would I trust it to control my door locks, cameras, or thermostat?  I didn't give it a bottom rating but it is fairly cool when it works, but the unreliability and lack of error reporting make it a product I will not be recommending to my friends.  I do not trust it to wake me up in the morning, as it should based on my existing daily alarm, and am extremely annoyed that it will not allow me to adjust that alarm nor provide me with any status as to why that might be.

"Michael Yeaple","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"The Echo Dot is excellent for controlling music (Spotify, in my case), setting timers/alarms, and performing conversions/calculations. It can't always hear me over my music, but it does a very good job in comparison to any other smart assistant. I haven't found many other skills to be terribly exciting or useful, but I haven't gotten into doing home automation (yet). For the price, it's definitely worth a buy if you're looking for something to throw in your kitchen for some hands-free assistance. ",
"Jamie Lyn","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Bought this for my bedroom to control my lights and play music. Glad I have the original Amazon Echo for the main part of my house. The dot is definitely not a substitute for the original Amazon Echo but rather a mediocre addition to it. The sound quality isn't as good but I expected that considering the size of the dot. So I just have it hooked up to my bedroom surround sound and let my good quality speakers do all the heavy lifting. The dot is very handy for controlling my lights after I've gotten into bed and am ready to sleep. However, at least once a week the dot will respond to one of my commands telling me that there is a problem with the connection and that it will need to be reset. Don't have a problem connecting any of my other devices in my bedroom and my original Amazon Echo has never failed me like this. So what the heck dot? It also defies me on a regular basis. I'll ask it to turn off the nightstand lights and it will only turn off one. Or I'll ask it to turn off my dresser light and it will turn on my nightstand lights. Super frustrating. It makes mistakes like this on a regular basis whereas my original Amazon Echo doesn't. If you love your original Amazon Echo and are thinking of getting a second but are feeling cheap...don't cheap out like I did. Just buy another original. Or if you are wanting your very first Echo and think that a dot is a good way to test it out to see if you like it before spending all that money, quit being cheap and just buy the original. ",
nkre,"April 10, 2017 ",4.0,"My kids especially love the Echo Dot. We mainly use it to listen to music, particularly &#34;KidsBop Radio&#34;, but I also have it linked to Pandora and iHeart Radio, and NPR. It's also great to set a timer, or to check the weather, or hear the news for the day. My kids like to ask Alexa to tell them jokes. I'm sure there are other ways to use Alexa but we haven't really messed around with it. We gave the Smart Plug to turn on things wirelessly which is really useful. You can just say &#34;Alexa, turn on the kids room lamp&#34;.    Negatives:  If you have the radio/music too loud though, you end up having to yell &#34;Alexa!&#34; several times for her to hear you, just to make a command to stop or skip the song, etc. I feel like a crazy person yelling &#34;Alexa! Alexa! Alexa!&#34; My kids even do it. The neighbors must think I have a dog named Alexa.    We have the TP-Link Smart Plug and have the lamp plugged into it, so we can easily ask Alexa to turn on the lamp. Usually she just turns it off quietly when I say &#34;Alexa, turn off the lamp&#34;. But sometimes,  she doesn't hear you, and she answers back with this long dialogue of &#34;I'm sorry, there is no device called living room xxxxx&#34; SO LOUDLY (because it was set at a loud volume from whatever you did earlier that day) that I just wished I had been able to turn off a light switch, old-school style! Ugh, technology complicates things sometimes! ",
Tolerable,"February 27, 2017 ",2.0,"I got 3 of these for &#34;Alarm Clock&#34; Christmas presents.  My 9 & 10 year olds had learned the painful lesson of pressing buttons on alarm clocks, so now it was time for them to get something WAY better.  When my 10 year old who is math crazy asked it &#34;what is the weight of the sun in grams&#34; and it answered, he was in love.  I love them also.  Just for alarm clocks and maybe weather, but they are very cool! ",
"Andrew Schutsky","March 30, 2017 ",4.0,"A cool little device - I originally purchased to use with my Wink for lighting control but I'm quickly finding new uses for it.  Didn't expect much more than a novelty at it's price point but it has been useful with traffic, weather, and for playing music which connects to my bluetooth speaker.  Maybe I'll buy one for downstairs as well? ",
BridgeImages,"March 12, 2017 ",5.0,"It is good for standard questions but it is not a google or bing search engine.    Mine is apparently defective    1. It will not play stereo music with headphones using 3.5 mm stereo jack - Only one side plays.  Same for stereo speakers with 3.5 mm jack    Both Speakers and headphone work with a computer and a TV set    2. It seems to be very sensitive to wi fi connection. It has trouble finding a connection    if it is moved a short distance...1 or 2 feet, It cannot pick up or hold wi fi. My note pad shows high signal all over that area and has never    had trouble finding a connection.    All other functions seem to work properly but, If I can find the packaging, I will return the device. ",
"J. McCloud","April 23, 2017 ",5.0,"The all new echo dot is a fantastic little device, I am blown away on how good it works. Alexa hears my voice from across the room, Gives me the weather, Traffic and plays my music instantly. I can also listen to the local news and get the time of day. It is small but the sound is great, I can hear my music playing from the other side of my house. It pairs easy with my Bluetooth speakers, Best 50 bucks I have ever spent and worth every penny. ",
"Ryan K.","December 20, 2016 ",3.0,"The Echo Dot works great for large and small rooms.  I picked this up to use in our living room, dining room and kitchen.  I did not need the larger Echo as I have a receive with Bluetooth that Echo connected to without a problem.  The far field microphones work very well in when giving commands to Alexa.  The Echo Dot would work very well in a small area as a stand alone device with out the need for external speakers. ",
"P. Berenberg","October 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I simply want: &#34;Alexa everywhere&#34;. I don't want to see or know where the device is. Dot does exactly that. Well, rather 3 of them in addition to 2 Echos, for 3 br house.  Interestingly enough the microphone system on Dot is even better than on Echo. It literally hears me across the house..  While the speaker in Dot is no comparison to Echo or high-end BT speakers, it is certainly better than alarm clock radios, or most smart phones.  . ",
"Robert Jones","March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I've been living with Alexa since the start of 2017, and it's been a mixed bag.  My background: electrical engineer, working with computers since late 70's in hardware and software design.  Expert.  Also a homeowner that wants a smart home.    At first, it was amazing.  It controlled my lights, answered my questions, set timers and alarms.  Played music.    Then, as many roommates, you learn about the real Alexa after some time.  If you want to make a fool out of yourself, ask Alexa something in front of a friend or a visitor.    Once in five times, when I say &#34;Master Off&#34;, it tells me about restaurants.  Master is the lighting group I set up for my bedroom.  It's annoying.    Twice now when I've made a lighting command it said &#34;there is a problem&#34;.  Once I called Amazon and they said it was a service problem.  The second time I didn't bother    On the music front, it seldom plays what I ask without asking for money.  Honestly, it gets annoying.    It's a great technology, but it's like a bad roommate.  Great in the beginning.  Hard to live with. ",
