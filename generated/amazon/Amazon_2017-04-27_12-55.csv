"Roy Estaris","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.  Happy Holidays  Roy ",
DJ,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.    If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!    Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.    1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.    2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.    3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, &#34;Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees&#34; got no result, so I tried &#34;Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees&#34; and she picked it up perfectly.    4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.    5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  &#34;Alexa, play 90s music&#34;, &#34;Alexa, play indie music&#34;, and &#34;Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds&#34;.  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great &#34;freebie&#34; if you're a prime member.    6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.    7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.    8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to &#34;Alexa, what's the definition of&#34;, &#34;Alexa, how far away is&#34;, &#34;Alexa, Wikipedia&#34; (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask &#34;Alexa, tell me more&#34;).  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.    9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).    Suggestions for Improvement:    1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like &#34;How far away is the sun&#34; but I'd really like too see Amazon add a &#34;search&#34; function.    2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.    3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings. ",
"Bryant R.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.  A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.  So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.  The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.  I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.  Thanks for letting me rant ",
RaVen,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!  This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say &#34;alexa&#34; and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.    We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its &#34;multi-room voice recognition&#34; technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word &#34;alexa&#34; on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a &#34;multi-device&#34; plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited      The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.  The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.    At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is &#34;alexa turn on the lights&#34; and our downstairs lights spring into action.    My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with &#34;sorry I didn't get that&#34;  Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.    Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your &#34;free&#34; music.    I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up &#34;New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing&#34; under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.    I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device. ",
"Brian C","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.    I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.    My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo &#34;skills&#34; that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the &#34;skills&#34; not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.    Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.    The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached. ",
"Lantana Al","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Amazon Echo is a great device (I was one of the first to have one and waiting for months for my first Echo to ship as Amazon vastly underestimated the demand for a device like this) and the Echo Dot (2nd generation) is fantastic in its size and capability (I bought a six pack to get one free). There is no volume ring on the 2nd gen Dot like there is on the original Echo and the 1st gen Echo Dot but it's no big deal as there are volume buttons now and the cost of the volume ring wasn't worth it if you ask me (it was nice, but for most people not worth the money). Most of the time you'll want to adjust the volume by voice anyway (like &#34;Alexa volume 5&#34;). The 2nd gen Echo Dot is also available in white but I'm sticking with black. UPDATE: I actually prefer the cheaper volume buttons on the Dot 2 to the volume ring now.    The fact that you can just talk from across the room and it can hear you (most of the time) really sets this apart. If you think you already have an Echo because you have Siri, Cortana, or Google, then know that it's just not the same.    Things I do: set timers, set alarms, get weather info, ask basic questions, listen to music (like Prime Music, Prime Stations, songs I bought, etc), listen to radio, ask for jokes, turn things on and off, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some things. The Echo really excels at playing music. I love it than I can ask for a song I want to hear and it will play it (most of the time anyway). At night I often listen to a local radio station and I just say &#34;Alexa stop&#34; without having to get out of bed when I want to stop listening.    When I listen to Prime Station I can tell it &#34;thumbs up&#34; if I like the song or &#34;thumbs down&#34; if I don't... and when I listen to the station again it won't play the songs that I've thumbed down.    Using the built-in speaker, the sound quality is decent for voice. For music you'll want to connect it to a speaker system because the Dot's small internal speaker is weak. I do wish I could AirPlay to a device from the Echo when I'm playing music and want the best sound quality, however Bluetooth is pretty impressive when it uses the near-CD quality codecs.    Positives:  * The new feature that Amazon added (ESP - Echo Spatial Perception) so that the nearest Echo responds is fantastic. I was also very happy to hear that the first generation Echoes will also support this in the next firmware update (I think devices are updating now). From my research, if the Echo app shows that you have a device software version greater than 4008 then you should have the update with ESP support. Unfortunately there does seem to be a minor downside: the Echo's response can sometimes be slightly delayed while multiple Echoes figure out which Echo is closest and should respond.  * It seems to hear better when playing music than the first gen. It was annoying when you would try to talk to it while it was playing but it couldn't hear you. The new Dot hears better during music playback but it's still not &#34;Star Trek quality&#34; hearing; sometimes you may still need to raise your voice.  * It's relatively cheap and well worth the asking price.  * It has a 3.5mm stereo audio jack, which I use with two of my Dots to connect to the line-in on one of my computers and another to the line-in on an old compact stereo/CD player. Sound quality should be good enough for anyone except audiophiles.  * Some people complain of connection issues, but all of my Echoes stay connected without issue to my&nbsp;Asus RT-AC68U&nbsp;router.  * If you want to 'Wikipedia' something then you can say 'Alexa, Wikipedia &#60;subject&#62;'. She'll read a little from Wikipedia. If you want her to read more after she stops then just say 'Alexa, tell me more'. This can be useful sometimes.    Negatives (mostly minor but take note):  * Warranty is only 90 days. I think it should be 1 year. Of course they will sell you a SquareTrade 1, 2, or 3 year warranty for $5/year if you want. Perhaps another cost-cutting move.  * The shiny (glossy) black surface can be a fingerprint magnet but you probably won't be touching it often. The previous generation wasn't glossy.  * I had trouble configured my 2nd Echo Dot (the first one went fine). The Alexa app (on Android) gave me the cryptic message &#34;Authorization expired. Please reconnect your phone to the internet, log out from the app and retry&#34;. Got it several times. I resolved it by signing out of the Alexa app and then signing back in, having to re-enter my email and password.... annoying... and I wonder why I didn't have this issue setting up my first Echo Dot just minutes prior???? Oh well. UPDATE: This just happened again on another day when setting up two more Echo Dots. This first Echo Dot setup went fine, but on the second one I got the &#34;Authorization expired.&#34; message again. Beware of this issue if setting up more than one Echo Dot.  * While trying out Amazon Music Unlimited with the Echo I immediately ran into the issue of the Echo playing the explicit version of songs instead of the clean version. There should be an option to never play explicit songs and to play the clean version instead (some people have children). The workaround until Amazon addresses this problem is to add the clean song to your music library and then say &#34;Alexa play &#60;song&#62; from my library&#34;.  * This doesn't affect me, but the Echo does not support enterprise networks that require centralized network authentication with a login. Some might want to know this (like teachers who might want to use it in a school that uses this type of network authentication).  * The Android Amazon Alexa app can be slow and frustrating sometimes. For example, when launching it sometimes just sits there on the intro screen and spins forever until you shut down the app and restart it again.  * Doesn't hear well in a noisy environment, or when other people (including on TV) are talking at the same time.    Home Automation:  * I use several&nbsp;Belkin WeMo&nbsp;switches to control some lights and fans. They work pretty well although not always perfectly. Fortunately they work better now after all the firmware updates.  * I can control my Honeywell WiFi thermostats using the &#34;Honeywell Total Connect Comfort&#34; skill. I have two downstairs for 2 zones. I have one&nbsp;Honeywell RTH9580WF1005/W1&nbsp;and one&nbsp;Honeywell RTH6580WF.  * I recently set it up to turn on and off certain activities with a&nbsp;Logitech Smart Hub. For example, I can say &#34;Alexa, turn on TiVo&#34; and it will turn on the TV and my receiver and set the TV and receiver inputs correctly. I can then use the remote which is synced... and turn it all off with &#34;Alexa turn off TiVo&#34;. There were some annoyances getting it all setup but I think it's pretty &#34;cool&#34; even though you can only start and stop activities with Alexa so you still need the remote to do other things (change channel, adjust volume, mute, pause, etc).  * I think I've only really scratched the surface of what is possible with home automation. I have not tried IFTTT (&#34;if this then that&#34;) recipes yet but I hear it is quite powerful and hope to try it out when I have more time to &#34;play&#34;.    Wishes:  * High-quality digital audio output that is better than Bluetooth. If it had this then you could really get high quality audio output from it, but most people probably don't really care that much as analog out is &#34;good enough&#34;.  * Smarter. After 2 years I wish the Echo was smarter. Yes, it has definitely improved over time but Google can still answer more questions than Alexa. It's going to be hard to beat Google in answering general questions.  * Weather alerts. I suggested this a long time ago and they still haven't added it... perhaps due to legal reasons? If would be great if it would sound some sort of alarm or notification for severe weather.  * Built-in support for notifying others that you might need help. This would be good for the elderly. There is a &#34;Ask My Buddy&#34; skill however, but the verbiage is a little awkward (&#34;Alexa, Ask My Buddy to Send Help&#34;) and it's free so if the developer decides to stop support then that might leave a lot of people without service at an inopportune time.    Compared to Google Home (which I just bought):  * Setup on Google Home was super-simple, easier than Echo (the Android app worked really well and setup seemed streamlined)  * Google Home is smarter for general questions... significantly smarter. I asked Google &#34;How long does it take to get to the Honda dealer in Lewisville&#34; and it told me about 26 minutes in current traffic conditions. Awesome. The Echo totally failed here.  * No AUX audio output like on Echo Dot  * I prefer saying &#34;Alexa&#34; to &#34;OK Google&#34; as the wake word (UPDATE: &#34;Hey Google&#34; works now too!)  * I currently prefer Echo for music and smart home control but I consider Google Home a serious threat to Echo because it is more &#34;intelligent&#34; than Echo    Other:  * It doesn't come with a 3.5mm audio cable but I can understand why as many people would probably not use it and Amazon wants to get the cost as low as possible so this isn't a big deal.  * The USB power cable is about 5 feet.  * The 1st gen Echo Dot was almost double the price. I feel a little disappointed that they now have a 2nd gen that is overall better for much less money... and that it came out very shortly after the 1st gen Echo Dots.  * You don't need any other Echo units to use the Dot... some people might think you do but this is just like the &#34;big Echo&#34;, only without the &#34;big&#34; sound. Instead a little speaker is included.  * It's USB powered and comes with a USB power adapter and USB cable. NOTE: If you use a USB power connection other than from the included power adapter then there could be power and/or sound quality issues. I had some sound quality issues (background noises) and eliminated them by switching to the included USB power adapter.  * About 10 or 15 minutes after setting it up, it said something like &#34;your Echo received an important update and must restart&#34;. So if you are having issues with it then you may want to give it awhile so it can update if needed.  * For better understanding of what you say, go to the Alexa app and Settings-&#62;Voice Training.  * I bought some of these powered bookshelf speakers, hooked them to the Echo Dot, and have been impressed with what you get for the money:&nbsp;Edifier R1280T Powered Bookshelf Speakers    While not perfect, I really like the Amazon Echo. I think the technology and potential is still in its infancy but the Echo is already really useful and excels at home automation, playing music, podcasts, and radio. Highly recommended, especially for the price. UPDATE: I'm reducing my rating from 4.5 to 4 stars due to Google Home being much smarter at answering general questions. The Echo is a good device but I think you should also seriously consider Google Home. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 14, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly, I love mine but obviously, there are some things that could be better. What do I love about it? Both my boyfriend and I downloaded the app and have access to a shopping list that we can both use at the grocery store depending on who is there. With a simple wake up word (her name) and the command of adding an item to the shopping list, it appears in the app. I can ask for a flash briefing and NPR news is retrieved and I am caught up all over the world in subjects from politics all the way to sports news. She also gives great weather information so that I am able to plan for my day ahead. Alexa can learn many skills that continue to evolve. Knowledge from what wines to pair with what meats and good cooking substitutes to helping with a drinking game and other games & trivia. Alexa comes in handy when I need a hands-free timer in the kitchen or an alarm for a nap. Now, what I don't really like but can get passed it once I get the hang of it. Sometimes you ask a question but she doesn't understand the question but you reword the question and she is able to understand it. So just be sure your wording the question correctly. Also, remember that Alexa is always listening. ",
Andrew,"October 24, 2016 ",4.0,"This was my first Echo purchase and I am overall very pleased with it's performance. Initially, I was worried that it was going to be a Siri knockoff with only a limited number of voice commands and functions with constant errors; however, I have not received single error response since I have owned it. I am an Amazon Prime member and from the time I clicked confirm purchase to the time it was delivered to my doorstep only took 3 days, and best part of all, shipping was free.    I currently have mine sitting by my bed and have synced it with the app, available on for all phone types, which allows me to carry out a number of voice commands including: &#34;Alexa, set an alarm for..., check the weather, play Pandora, or tell me a joke.&#34; The app interface is a little clunky at times, but you're able to see the history of recent requests, and Alexa is constantly learning and adapting to your specific commands and style.    If you are looking to buy an Echo Dot because you want a cheap introduction into Bluetooth connectivity with household lights, televisions, gaming systems, thermostats, or other Echo products then buy this Echo Dot. I am working with a grad student budget, and for $50 dollars this sleek and sexy &#34;command station&#34; was worth every penny. I did not receive any compensation for this review, I am writing it because I debated on buying one for about a week before pulling the trigger, and I just want to speed up the process for people like me who may be waffling...trust me, its completely worth the $50.

"LUCY  Von","April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I got Dot about a week after the big Echo from my son as a gift. We set her up and all was fine. Until nothing eas fine anymore 😢 . She would respond initially, but not always though, and when she was playing music she would not respond to the wake word. At all. I reset, few times, but nithing worked. I called Amazon. Within minutes they had me connected to Echo's tech support, and in no time did we have Dot fixed. They reset her factory settings with me. We tested and now our darling little Dot is happy and healthy! So call Amazon if you do have issues, it's a matter of setup or wifi or in any case, something that they can fix. Wonderful support for a wondrful device. I do wish I could call her Dot though. Or a name that I choose. Because now I have two Alexa's in one household 🤔, and calling her Echo or Amazon ain't gonna work for me 😢. Please vote my review up if you liked it. ",
"Marquino Gadget guru","March 26, 2017 ",5.0,"This is what I`ve been waiting for!!!!  It is simple amazing what you can do with technology nowadays, Amazon is always innovating and staying on top with technology.  This new Amazon Echo Dot does what it says it does and provides all the necessary information by simply asking!  We like it to much i got a second device to add it in my room, been able to connect to your Bluetooth speakers and devices you can automate lots of things.  Great job Amazon ",
"Keirstyn G.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I would like to give a testimonial about this product my sisters and I purchased the echo Dot for my mother for Christmas who is handicapped. She stays at home by herself most days and has limited access to what she can do do to being legally blind and having a neurological disorder. Now she is able to do so many things for herself that she was unable to do for many many years. A few days after Christmas I walked over to her house in the morning to help her out and I could hear music playing and then I hear her yell out Alexa thumbs down that song. I laughed because she was upstairs laying in bed listening to music she said she'd been listening all morning and it made her so happy. This has really been a life-changing gift. Before this she was unable to turn on the TV herself or turn on her music and had a hard time with her tablet turning her audible books on now all she has to do is speak to Alexa and it has opened a whole new world for her ",
Vince,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I have the regular Echo and it's amazing. I bought the Echo Dot for my dad who had been using a little antenna radio around the house. This isn't mobile but it allows him to play Pandora or just to tell it what kind of music to play. It was purchased through my account but I created an Amazon account for him so I could link Pandora to it. That way he has his own Pandora account. Echo can switch accounts at any time with a voice command but we keep them on the primary users' account. I was worried the audio quality wouldn't be any good based on reviews but it's really not bad at all if you're replacing a little radio. It's not audiophile fill the room with brilliance quality, but it gets the music out and doesn't sound tinny or anything. My dad really enjoys it. ",
"Kathryn H.","January 6, 2017 ",5.0,"Love the Echo Dot. I got the buy 3 discount, which makes it worth while. I am sure there will be more things added and improved on in time, but so far it is a bit limited in what I can use it for. We don't have a modern set up in our house so that it can adjust lights or temp so that part is useless to us.  I got it mostly for my 93 year old mother whom I take care of, as she constantly asks me what day or time it is, so now she can ask the Echo. I also like the ability to get a weather report for the day, and I still need to set up the calendar for daily events for mom, once I get that set up it will be another great advantage in having this. I hope they can come up with a way to make this an intercom also between rooms so that if she needs me at any time Echo can alert me in some way. That alone would make this a really great item worth five stars.  So far my favorite feature is the radio, I just ask it to play a particular type of music and it comes on. You do have to be specific about how to get the type of music you want to hear rather than just ask it to play a particular genre. I also like that you can vocally tell it to turn down or up the volume, and to skip the song playing and it goes to the next one. I don't use it to shop with, might be helpful to some. Also, it does take a little adjusting to the way some people speak, my voice is clear but moms is a little muffles so it took a few times of asking questions to get it use to her voice, now it works good for her. The distance to where it can hear you is good and volume on answering and music is great, you don't really need added speakers unless you want to hear it over a very large room, or whole house.  Pros: Received quickly with free Prime shipping, ability to play music, ask for date, time, and weather without touching anything, get answeres to a lot of questions, and the ability to update and improve over time. Volume is great for small to medium size rooms, and several feet away form it. Great price for 3.  Cons: Still some limitations, no intercom set up yet, need to be specific about where to get radio from. ",
"Bryan Warren","April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable. Here's the basics. Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power. On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use. Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables. Using this rig through my phones hotspot along with Amazons unlimited music to replace XM radio for only $3.99 a month plus full functionality of hands free Alexa services. ",
Manders,"April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"I like the Dot quite a bit, but it could be better. I'm not sure if it is the ALEXA program that the Dot connects to or if it is the Bing Search engine, I will have to do some more testing. Some times it can't find info it should be able to. Playing Music works Great!!! The Built in speaker is OK. But if you connect it to a really good speaker with either an Audio Cable or Bluetooth it sounds Great!! I am having the Dot read a Kindle book to me. It works well but the inflections in the text to speech program need work. However that is not a limitation of the device but of current technology. Getting local weather or movies works well. Alexa can &#34;learn&#34; other &#34;Skills&#34; but you have to tell Alexa to use the skill. It would be better if these skills were available all the time, and didn't have to be &#34;turned on&#34;. The Dot does not have a battery, so if you unplug it, it will need to search and connect to your WIFI again when you plug it back in. A great work around is to get a small battery pack (needs a least a 1 amp output port) and keep it plugged into the battery pack and then plug the battery pack into a wall charger. This allows the Dot to be truly portable. I had mine in my shirt pocket and was listening to a book while putting up Christmas lights outside for at least two hours. The Dot works Great, I am hoping that Alexa herself will get smarter. ",
"Kindle Customer","December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"EDIT: All thanks to Amazon's customer service, I learned why my Echo was not working. It must be 8&#34; -12&#34; away from a wall. Our Echo Dot works when against an interior wall but not against an exterior wall where it had previously been situated. We adore &#34;Alexa&#34; and hope the Echo Dot will soon add a great speaker to its features. For the price, this is a fantastic device. And, it's diminutive size makes it easy to use. Still, our family prefers full-size Echo. Thanks, Amazon for the email help with Echo Dot!  *****  We are an Amazon device family. And, with the exception of this device, have had wonderful experiences.    Echo Dot remains connected until the next time I use it. Literally, I reconnect Echo Dot to our network, ask it a few questions, play some music, walk away. When I return Echo has spontaneously disconnected itself and requires the reconnection procedure again.    We have two full size Echos and have no connection issues with them. They operate flawlessly. ",
"Amazon fan","December 15, 2016 ",5.0,"After using the Echo Dot for more than a month, I am sure it was worth buying it !! I am loving all the things it can do and sometimes its fun to ask silly questions. The biggest advantage is to be able to turn your TV  on and off without looking for remote when you come tired from work.    After reading a few blogs about using Echo for automation at home, I have now started working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi to design some new circuits to integrate Echo to control lights and other appliances and to do more with navigation on TV. I am loving it and would recommend it!! ",
Kainesmith.ky,"April 13, 2017 ",4.0,"I really like the echo dot so far. It has a few issues though which I will outline below.    She tends to speak when not spoken to.  I am a 30 year old male that lives alone and it makes me jump every time but because I'm a big brave man I fight through the fear. Jokes aside though, if it were an older person who lives alone I could really see that being a problem. I'll be sitting watching tv and she will ask me to repeat my question or state a random answer to a question that I did not ask, maybe she picks up the tv I'm not sure.  If there is any other noise what so ever she doesn't pick up the wake up word, so be prepared to mute the tv, tell everyone to be quiet and then say Alexa, or in my case echo. I have had to say echo releatedly a few times.    Some good about it is the surprisingly good sound of the speaker when it's playing music. It is much better than I expected after reading some of the reviews.  I like the &#34;to do list&#34; and &#34;shopping list&#34; feature which I add to the lists in the app for more clarity then have her read them back to me every morning. I also like asking for world news every morning when I first get up.  It looks neat also and over all for the price I think it is worth it even if it only played music upon command from across the room. I can see myself using her for that the most. ",
Aphonic,"January 23, 2017 ",4.0,"The far field mic in the second gen do the is way better than the full size echo.  Now if they could just use a source for weather that was even remotely accurate I'd be happy.  Accuweather is ten degrees off a tank my location always. Minimum.  The dot works well.  It's a good cheap way to get alexa.  The speaker quality is fine for audio books and news briefings. Not for music.  It seems faster to respond than the full size echo (1st generation). I believe it's a better option to buy this and pair a nice bt speaker than buy the full echo st this point.  One star off for missing some basic features.  Like accurate weather and basic google searching.  It's useful for my home automation but I still  Find the echo line of products of very limited use outside of that.  Good for a kitchen timer or wake up  Alarm.  Good for some news.  Needs much better podcast management to be very useful.  Oh yah. And accurate weAther.  Amazon prime music is a. Nice touch as is music unlimited for the echo at $3.99 a month. ",
Dion,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I bought 16 of these and gave most of them out as Christmas presents. When I bought my first one in 2015 I was impressed with the questions I asked and the responses I received. These past 5 months or so I believe Alexia must have gone in for a lobotomy. Seldom understands the question. Upgraded to the Prime Music. For how large they say the music library is, I have it ask an average of 3 times before it sometimes plays the song I requested. Yes you can load all sorts of &#34;skills&#34; but they need to come up with a way to allow you to print or even e-mail the skills and commands to yourself. ",
"D. Coral","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"It's hard to tell how you're actually going to use this until you try it!    Before I received the Echo Dot 2, I thought maybe I would use it for quick research like &#34;tell me about antheraxanthin supplements&#34; -- but I'm not using it like that because I haven't figured out the right way to say the phrases so she understands what I'm seeking.    Instead, I find the Echo to be super useful as a helping hand for daily routines: change the thermostat temperature, turn on and off the lights, tell me what time it is, set the alarm clock for the next morning, tell me the fastest route to avoid traffic, and especially to play music.    As a former musician I'm picky about speakers so I did a lot of research on the best sounding bluetooth speaker under $200.  I ended up purchasing the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3.  The Bose Soundlink III also has amazing sound quality but unfortunately the Soundlink III switches off 30 minutes after no longer detecting a sound signal, so it's not practical to use the Soundlink III with Echo.    The Bose SoundTouch 10 is also a popular speaker for use with Echo Dot, but you can get the better sounding Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3 for even less, available in both black and white.    What really impressed me about Echo Dot 2 is that it wakes up even when I'm saying &#34;Alexa&#34; softly way across from the other side of the house.    The only thing that bugs me is that I wish there was a better way to say home automation commands.  Alexa uses the phrase &#34;turn on&#34; for just about every home device (except for thermostats, which have additional commands).  So I would say &#34;turn on open window shades&#34; instead of simply being able to say &#34;open window shades.&#34;  Alexa would be greatly improved if a user could add custom phrases that map to an automation command.    But it's still a lot better than Google Home because for that product you have to say &#34;OK, Google&#34; to wake up, which is totally awkward to say all the time.  Amazon is much better at naming things -- Using &#34;Alexa&#34; as the wakeup command is pleasant to say.    Two cute things to try with Alexa:    &#34;Alexa, do you like green eggs and ham?&#34;    &#34;Alexa, tell me the truth.&#34; ",
"L. Snow","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I've spent and lot of time trying to fix problems with the Google Chromecast/Home, and I am amazed at how those problems go away playing Spotify on an Amazon Echo Dot instead.    I want to run Spotify on my home, whole-house stereo, which I also use to play the radio or even cds and lps, anytime or all the time on any day.  Chromecast (now Google Home) isn't really meant to do that.  It wants to receive a &#34;cast&#34; signal from another device, and only for a certain time.  If you remove or close that device, Cast/Home goes into a weird kind of limbo state that may keep playing Spotify for a while but locks out control.  Even if you leave a dedicated device like a phone in place, it still times out and locks up.  I've had it crash like this several times a day, in the middle of a song.  The only solution is to close both Spotify and Home completely from the device and start over.    But the Echo isn't receiving a cast, it is casting itself.  It is always on.  It always appears in my list of Spotify devices.  I can always engage it from any device using Spotify Connect.  It doesn't turn off after a certain time.  And it doesn't crash.    Also, the Google Cast/Home crashes when I use my microwave.  Echo Dot doesn't do that.    Echo Dots do not coordinate.  So if you want to control you whole house system from a place where you can't speak to Alexa, you have to use an app on a phone or other device (Spotify, Alexa, and/or your stereo's app).  Or you can buy a Voice Remote for the Echo, which is apparently bluetooth but works over ridiculously long distance, basically my whole place.    In short, the Echo Dot works with Spotify and my home stereo like I thought Google Home would do but doesn't.  It costs about the same and it saves me a ton of headaches.  It makes Spotify really great in my home. ",
Jeff,"December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Very cool tech but feels like its still in its infancy. And has one fatal flaw if you plan to use primarily for music playback as we did.    The voice recognition is neat and works some of the time but often fails to understand and really struggles to recognize playlist names. It also often can't hear over its own playback (even with significant speaker separation), resulting in my wife or daughter yelling at Alexa. Tech fail. Especially problematic with guests over. So we increasingly use the app to control playback. The app is ok but not great compared to sonos or squeezebox alternatives.    We've connected to a small bluetooth speaker which sounds surprisingly good. But lacks bass. Unfortunately there is no easy way to add a sub connection without adding a stereo amp. Which we did and it sounds much better.    Now for the fatal flaw. We have three dots spread throughout the house. Each connected to their own speakers. We were hoping to setup as an alternative to sonos. And Logitechs now defunct squeezebox (what we had prior). We paid for premium music plan and uploaded our entire library. Only problem is amazon won't let you playback different music from your own library to different dots at the same time. Really!? And no way to connect to local source/server like sonos or squeezebox.    Looks like we'll end up with Sonos after all. ",
Blade56989,"December 2, 2016 ",5.0,"Its a great product, but it still has a way to go before it meets my needs. I primarily got it to help me be more organized, and to make agenda management easier. While calendar scheduling can be a bit tricky, its not to hard once you get the hang of it. The main issue with it writing down the wrong thing because you didn't say it clearly enough.    But what I also really wanted was for Alexa to able to read different lists to me when I asked.    The thing that bugs me is the pairing &#34;List&#34; apps, its SOOO STUPID how it does this. Basically it pairs with apps that you make dedicated lists on, and since Alexa comes restricted with 2 lists &#34;Shopping list&#34; and &#34;To Do List&#34;, you'd think it would be able to have Alexa read and manage those lists on the paired apps. But NO, it just allows the apps to manage the only 2 lists Alexa has!  The reason this is so stupid, is that the dedicated &#34;Alexa app&#34;, that you need to have on your phone for the Echo anyways, already has a list manager for those 2 lists! So I got the Any.do app (list app) for nothing, since Alexa cant actually interact with it. So the &#34;morning routine&#34; and &#34;Exercise Routine&#34; lists I was making on Any.do, cant be read by Alexa.    But thankfully this is an actively developing product, so maybe in a future update this will be implemented. ",

"A. Hewitt","April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"This device has lots of potential but we're still beginners, using it as a replacement for a radio, CD player, alarm clock and timer. The Echo Dot has performed as expected. In the bedroom, it's paired with a TDK A33 Bluetooth speaker and it's good enough for music listening, amazingly good for the size of the speaker. In the living room, I wanted better sound (think Saint-Saens Organ Symphony) so I got out my hand-truck and moved some old B&W loudspeakers into the dining area. With an Esinkin Bluetooth receiver&nbsp;Esinkin Bluetooth Receiver, Bluetooth Audio Adapter (NFC Enabled) for Stereo Sound System with Long Range and Acoustics&nbsp;and an old Topping TP32 amplifier, it worked! But the TP32 runs off a 12V supply, so it's 24V rail-to-rail, 8V RMS. An efficient 4-ohm speaker would be OK but the B&Ws are 8-ohms so the maximum power is 5 watts - talk about background music. I changed over to an old JVC stereo amplifier and all was well. At least until CINCHOUSE (Commander-in-Chief House a.k.a. She Who Must Be Obeyed) walked in and said: &#34;Those speakers are TOO BIG. They have to go&#34;. So I got out my hand-truck ... After I had decluttered the dining area I devised a Plan B. The TV has a headphone jack which is connected to a pair of Mackie MR5 speakers&nbsp;Pair of Mackie MR mk3 Series MR5mk3 5-Inch 2-Way Powered Studio Monitors&nbsp;(which I think sound better than any soundbar at the price) and they are always powered on so if I could mix the TV and Echo signals I could hear either (or both at once). I bought a Behringer Xenyx 502 mixer&nbsp;Behringer XENYX502 5-Channel Mixer, connected the TV and Bluetooth receiver to it, hooked the output to the Mackies and - voila! - beautiful music from the Echo. By damn, ain't technology grand!  Update: I had been reluctant to put the Echo close to the TV because I expected the sound from the speakers to interfere with the voice commands but I now have it sitting just behind the TV, level with the TV feet. The Echo understands me as well as ever and I'm able to hardwire it into the mixer. The sound is improved over Bluetooth. It sounds better all over the room and if I stand in front of the speakers the stereo imaging is amazingly precise. ",
"Keirstyn G.","January 24, 2017 ",2.0,"I would like to give a testimonial about this product my sisters and I purchased the echo Dot for my mother for Christmas who is handicapped. She stays at home by herself most days and has limited access to what she can do do to being legally blind and having a neurological disorder. Now she is able to do so many things for herself that she was unable to do for many many years. A few days after Christmas I walked over to her house in the morning to help her out and I could hear music playing and then I hear her yell out Alexa thumbs down that song. I laughed because she was upstairs laying in bed listening to music she said she'd been listening all morning and it made her so happy. This has really been a life-changing gift. Before this she was unable to turn on the TV herself or turn on her music and had a hard time with her tablet turning her audible books on now all she has to do is speak to Alexa and it has opened a whole new world for her ",

I am on my way to having my life so much easier as I am now looking at doing a smart home set up and getting a second one to just keep in the kitchen for the todo list and grocery lists, weather reports and everything else I can think of. While the other stays at bedside for sleep music, reading and some meditations as well as an alarm. I have yet to get the hubby to talk to echo to add groceries to the list but he will in time as he sees everything that it can do. I was able to set up my calendar right from the start. I do hope that they soon ad a reminder that I can just ask what I need to know or reminders for my husband. ",
Jeff,"January 24, 2017 ",2.0,"Very cool tech but feels like its still in its infancy. And has one fatal flaw if you plan to use primarily for music playback as we did.    The voice recognition is neat and works some of the time but often fails to understand and really struggles to recognize playlist names. It also often can't hear over its own playback (even with significant speaker separation), resulting in my wife or daughter yelling at Alexa. Tech fail. Especially problematic with guests over. So we increasingly use the app to control playback. The app is ok but not great compared to sonos or squeezebox alternatives.    We've connected to a small bluetooth speaker which sounds surprisingly good. But lacks bass. Unfortunately there is no easy way to add a sub connection without adding a stereo amp. Which we did and it sounds much better.    Now for the fatal flaw. We have three dots spread throughout the house. Each connected to their own speakers. We were hoping to setup as an alternative to sonos. And Logitechs now defunct squeezebox (what we had prior). We paid for premium music plan and uploaded our entire library. Only problem is amazon won't let you playback different music from your own library to different dots at the same time. Really!? And no way to connect to local source/server like sonos or squeezebox.    Looks like we'll end up with Sonos after all. ",
"Shelby Bayard","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my Echo Dot, and Alexa is a great addition to my life.  Easy to connect and set up.  I did stumble a bit with the App on my Tablet, but all in all, I hope Echo Dot and Alexa are around for a VERY LONG TIME.  ONLY 1 suggestion:  Have an &#34;Ask Google&#34; app, or a &#34;Wikipedia&#34; app.  I would love to say, &#34;Alexa, Ask Google when King Henry VIII died&#34;.  I keep calling her &#34;Alexis&#34; and she still responds.  I connected a pair of old speakers from an older computer (JBL Amplified Speakers) but even with out the speakers, The music wasn't a bad quality.. it wasn't a Hi-Fi Stereo sound, but good enough to listen to while i'm working on the computer.  Great Job Amazon~!!!!!! ",
Blade56989,"April 21, 2017 ",3.0,"Its a great product, but it still has a way to go before it meets my needs. I primarily got it to help me be more organized, and to make agenda management easier. While calendar scheduling can be a bit tricky, its not to hard once you get the hang of it. The main issue with it writing down the wrong thing because you didn't say it clearly enough.    But what I also really wanted was for Alexa to able to read different lists to me when I asked.    The thing that bugs me is the pairing &#34;List&#34; apps, its SOOO STUPID how it does this. Basically it pairs with apps that you make dedicated lists on, and since Alexa comes restricted with 2 lists &#34;Shopping list&#34; and &#34;To Do List&#34;, you'd think it would be able to have Alexa read and manage those lists on the paired apps. But NO, it just allows the apps to manage the only 2 lists Alexa has!  The reason this is so stupid, is that the dedicated &#34;Alexa app&#34;, that you need to have on your phone for the Echo anyways, already has a list manager for those 2 lists! So I got the Any.do app (list app) for nothing, since Alexa cant actually interact with it. So the &#34;morning routine&#34; and &#34;Exercise Routine&#34; lists I was making on Any.do, cant be read by Alexa.    But thankfully this is an actively developing product, so maybe in a future update this will be implemented. ",
"D. Coral","December 20, 2016 ",5.0,"It's hard to tell how you're actually going to use this until you try it!    Before I received the Echo Dot 2, I thought maybe I would use it for quick research like &#34;tell me about antheraxanthin supplements&#34; -- but I'm not using it like that because I haven't figured out the right way to say the phrases so she understands what I'm seeking.    Instead, I find the Echo to be super useful as a helping hand for daily routines: change the thermostat temperature, turn on and off the lights, tell me what time it is, set the alarm clock for the next morning, tell me the fastest route to avoid traffic, and especially to play music.    As a former musician I'm picky about speakers so I did a lot of research on the best sounding bluetooth speaker under $200.  I ended up purchasing the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3.  The Bose Soundlink III also has amazing sound quality but unfortunately the Soundlink III switches off 30 minutes after no longer detecting a sound signal, so it's not practical to use the Soundlink III with Echo.    The Bose SoundTouch 10 is also a popular speaker for use with Echo Dot, but you can get the better sounding Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3 for even less, available in both black and white.    What really impressed me about Echo Dot 2 is that it wakes up even when I'm saying &#34;Alexa&#34; softly way across from the other side of the house.    The only thing that bugs me is that I wish there was a better way to say home automation commands.  Alexa uses the phrase &#34;turn on&#34; for just about every home device (except for thermostats, which have additional commands).  So I would say &#34;turn on open window shades&#34; instead of simply being able to say &#34;open window shades.&#34;  Alexa would be greatly improved if a user could add custom phrases that map to an automation command.    But it's still a lot better than Google Home because for that product you have to say &#34;OK, Google&#34; to wake up, which is totally awkward to say all the time.  Amazon is much better at naming things -- Using &#34;Alexa&#34; as the wakeup command is pleasant to say.    Two cute things to try with Alexa:    &#34;Alexa, do you like green eggs and ham?&#34;    &#34;Alexa, tell me the truth.&#34; ",
"L. Snow","April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"I've spent and lot of time trying to fix problems with the Google Chromecast/Home, and I am amazed at how those problems go away playing Spotify on an Amazon Echo Dot instead.    I want to run Spotify on my home, whole-house stereo, which I also use to play the radio or even cds and lps, anytime or all the time on any day.  Chromecast (now Google Home) isn't really meant to do that.  It wants to receive a &#34;cast&#34; signal from another device, and only for a certain time.  If you remove or close that device, Cast/Home goes into a weird kind of limbo state that may keep playing Spotify for a while but locks out control.  Even if you leave a dedicated device like a phone in place, it still times out and locks up.  I've had it crash like this several times a day, in the middle of a song.  The only solution is to close both Spotify and Home completely from the device and start over.    But the Echo isn't receiving a cast, it is casting itself.  It is always on.  It always appears in my list of Spotify devices.  I can always engage it from any device using Spotify Connect.  It doesn't turn off after a certain time.  And it doesn't crash.    Also, the Google Cast/Home crashes when I use my microwave.  Echo Dot doesn't do that.    Echo Dots do not coordinate.  So if you want to control you whole house system from a place where you can't speak to Alexa, you have to use an app on a phone or other device (Spotify, Alexa, and/or your stereo's app).  Or you can buy a Voice Remote for the Echo, which is apparently bluetooth but works over ridiculously long distance, basically my whole place.    In short, the Echo Dot works with Spotify and my home stereo like I thought Google Home would do but doesn't.  It costs about the same and it saves me a ton of headaches.  It makes Spotify really great in my home. ",
"Patrick Glose","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I'm sure there isn't much to say that has not already been said, but I did want to give koodo's to the developers of this device.  My home already has nice sound, the price of the echo was just not in my electronics budget at this time.  I was very excited when I found the Dot, and for the price, I had to give it a go.  I've only had it for about a week now, but we love it (her).  Many Easter eggs built in, and just asking her to play a song, a group, or genre and have her do it is delightful.  Right now, she's hooked up to my Denon through a 3.5mm jack, but the Denon doesn't offer bluetooth.  I'm working on adding a bluetooth HDMI adapter.  As for automation, I am a bit of a tinkerer when it comes to gadget and cool stuff, so I went on several hunts when Alexa arrived to our home.  From what I can tell, if you're looking to automate (lights, thermostat, etc), you will most likely need a hub.  At first, I thought I'd need several hubs to support different manufacturers devices.  Seemingly, not so.  The Samsung SmartThings hub ($50 on Amazon right now) not only has support for most device manufacturers, but also has (and the coolest part for me) open source platform (Amazon also has open source).  What this means is, like Android, anyone can develop &#34;skills&#34; (Amazons name for an app or program).  The market is going to flood with new skills and devices from people like me who love building tech.  So, like I said, there probably isn't much I can say about the Dot that hasn't been said, but there is much to be said for the Alexa environment.  p.s., the microphones (7 of them) are amazing.  She can hear me from a good distance. ",
Ty,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought 8 of these (4 Black & 4 White) under 3 seperate orders at sale price. All arrived for Christmas and I opened mine last night. Installation easy peasy lemon squeezy. Said &#34;Alexa Temperature&#34; and got quick response then said &#34;Alexa play song  Grown Up Christmas List by Charice and it played and then said &#34;Alexa Playlist&#34; and it begin playing music from my Amazon Playlist.  I was concerned about Echo Dot volume based on some reviews and it is perfect in family room. I even paired it with a Bluetooth Sardine speaker that I have for richer tones, but the Echo Dot built in speakers are nice. The Amazon Echo Dot should have been on everyone's &#34; Grown Up Christmas  List&#34;. ",
"A. Hewitt","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This device has lots of potential but we're still beginners, using it as a replacement for a radio, CD player, alarm clock and timer. The Echo Dot has performed as expected. In the bedroom, it's paired with a TDK A33 Bluetooth speaker and it's good enough for music listening, amazingly good for the size of the speaker. In the living room, I wanted better sound (think Saint-Saens Organ Symphony) so I got out my hand-truck and moved some old B&W loudspeakers into the dining area. With an Esinkin Bluetooth receiver&nbsp;Esinkin Bluetooth Receiver, Bluetooth Audio Adapter (NFC Enabled) for Stereo Sound System with Long Range and Acoustics&nbsp;and an old Topping TP32 amplifier, it worked! But the TP32 runs off a 12V supply, so it's 24V rail-to-rail, 8V RMS. An efficient 4-ohm speaker would be OK but the B&Ws are 8-ohms so the maximum power is 5 watts - talk about background music. I changed over to an old JVC stereo amplifier and all was well. At least until CINCHOUSE (Commander-in-Chief House a.k.a. She Who Must Be Obeyed) walked in and said: &#34;Those speakers are TOO BIG. They have to go&#34;. So I got out my hand-truck ... After I had decluttered the dining area I devised a Plan B. The TV has a headphone jack which is connected to a pair of Mackie MR5 speakers&nbsp;Pair of Mackie MR mk3 Series MR5mk3 5-Inch 2-Way Powered Studio Monitors&nbsp;(which I think sound better than any soundbar at the price) and they are always powered on so if I could mix the TV and Echo signals I could hear either (or both at once). I bought a Behringer Xenyx 502 mixer&nbsp;Behringer XENYX502 5-Channel Mixer, connected the TV and Bluetooth receiver to it, hooked the output to the Mackies and - voila! - beautiful music from the Echo. By damn, ain't technology grand!  Update: I had been reluctant to put the Echo close to the TV because I expected the sound from the speakers to interfere with the voice commands but I now have it sitting just behind the TV, level with the TV feet. The Echo understands me as well as ever and I'm able to hardwire it into the mixer. The sound is improved over Bluetooth. It sounds better all over the room and if I stand in front of the speakers the stereo imaging is amazingly precise. ",
Finny,"December 25, 2016 ",5.0,"We have ten echos in my home.  A full-sized Echo, one of the 1st gen dots, and eight of these new dots.  We obviously like the platform, and have a great deal of personal experience with using all of the different versions of this personal assistant.    My wife and I have slowly converted my home light by light, door by door, and even my security system to being compatible with and function through Alexa.    &#34;Alexa, turn on the lamp,&#34; &#34;Alexa, turn on the fan,&#34; &#34;Alexa, lock the doors,&#34;  &#34;Alexa turn on the heater,&#34; &#34;Alexa, turn on the tv...&#34; and on and on.    We purchased the eight new dots to add them to children's bedrooms, to our exercise room, to our home theater, and to our entry way.  No matter where I am in my house now, one of my &#34;Digital wives&#34; as I refer to Alexa... can hear me.    Pros:  This new echo is smaller, lighter, and far less expensive than the original, including the original dot.  It is well built, feels sturdy, has loud volume, and seems to function well.  Even in the parts of my house where I am really stretching wifi, due to distance.    With our audible subscription, and with a healthy supply of several children's books that we have purchased over the years, each of my kids can have a personal assistant read them to sleep each night.  Which is nice.  They each pick whatever story they want, from The Cat In The Hat, to Harry Potter, to Jane Austen, and listen to a book as they fall asleep.  They are getting very adept at asking her to read their favorite book.    She is also great help for homework.  She explains things they don't understand, looks up endless random facts, and is much quicker than a calculator would be.  She is an excellent &#34;digital mother.&#34;  (Again, a joke... sort of...)    I find myself getting frustrated with the appliances that don't yet work with Alexa.  &#34;You mean, I have to actually lift my hand and push a button!  I can't just ask Alexa to do it!!  That is sooo last year!!!&#34;    It is small, unintrustive, out of sight, yet always there whenever I say her name, and ask her to do something.  My favorite is &#34;Alexa Trigger I love Anna.&#34;  I have this setup to email my wife that I love her, text her that I love her, and flash all the lights in the house pink several times!    Cons:  As much as I love my digital wife she is not quite perfect.  She has her quarks and her flaws.    Only one person can use her at a time:  Amazon added a new feature with this release to account for the fact that multiple Echos can hear me throughout the house.  This is nice in that it ensures that only one echo ever responds when I ask her for help.  However, an unintentional consequence is that with nine of us in the house constantly turning things on and off, and asking her questions, we have quickly learned  that only one person can ask a question at a time.  If my son across the house is talking to Alexa, I can't.  She will ignore me.  It is fine once he is done making his request.  ie, if he starts a book.  Once the book is actually playing I can then  make my request.  However while he is actually talking, she will only listen to him.  I can't engage her on any other echo in the house.    This has been annoying on multiple occasions!  They need to allow me to setup which Echos are close to each other, and which are far apart, so that the far away ones can operate independently.  Another option would be to program her to recognize voices, and distinguish between requests coming from different people.    Can't make multiple requests:  I should be able to say &#34;Alexa turn on the fan and the lights&#34; or &#34;Alexa play music and set the volume to 8&#34;  Instead I have to separate each request into its own sentence, &#34;Alexa turn on the fan.&#34;  Then wait then &#34;Alexa turn on the lights.&#34;    My kids can turn my bedroom lights on and off:  This is probably the most annoying thing about our setup.  My kids can say &#34;Alexa trigger Dad's lamp&#34; and cause my lamp to turn on and off.  There needs to be a way to restrict certain skills to certain alexas.  ie, when I walk into one room I shouldn't have to say &#34;Alexa turn on living room lights.&#34;  I should instead be able to say &#34;Alexa turn on the lights&#34; and have it know that I am in the living room based on which echo heard my request.  Likewise I should be able to block access to certain lights or features on specific echos that are in other rooms.    All in all though we love the technology, and will continue to invest in it.  Amazon has already made many improvements, and I have no doubt that they will make many more! ",
Diavolo57,"January 28, 2017 ",5.0,"Ok, so I wouldn't say I'm a pro at the Dot, navigating Alexa, or any of that just yet because this is my first &#34;echo&#34; device and I only got it a few days ago.  Maybe I'll come back and write a more in-depth review after I've had it for a few weeks/months.  Now that I've laid down the origin of my review I must say I'm really happy with it.  It's real easy to set up, just like up to your wifi, download the app, and set her up.  I've always liked the concept of the echo but dropping $180 on one turned me off, then the dot came out.  It can essentially do everything the Echo can for about $130 less AND it can hook up to bluetooth speakers...The echo cannot.  Granted the Echo has a better built in speaker from what I'm told but it can't be linked up to other bluetooth speakers, but the Dot can with bluetooth or audio cable...I haven't actually used this feature because I'm pretty happy with the speaker the Dot currently wields, it's not bad. It's clear and it can get loud, maybe if your having a party you might want to link up to a bigger sound systems but for lounging around at home it's perfect.    The skills are easy to obtain through the alexa app, as I've only had it for a few days I really haven't explored much of what alexa has to offer but I've been satisfied with the responses I got from the questions I asked.  I've basically asked her about the weather (I learned the Big Sky skill, which gives a much more detailed weather forecast and I recommend it), traffic, news, how to make certain cocktails, music, random facts, tell me a joke, silly stuff like that...It's fun...and the fact that it was only $50 makes it even better.  Regardless, she understands me pretty clearly, there are I believe, 7 microphones in it, and when you talk to it the blue light on it will also indicate where it's picking up your voice which is neat. I also heard there are some cool Star Wars/Star Trek/Game of Thrones Easter eggs that I want to try out (like say Beam me up, or winter is coming or something like that).  Another interesting feature is that the app records all the interactions you've had with alexa. For instance, I asked her how to make a Tom Collins cocktail, and I looked on the app and she had the recipe there along with the other questions/interactions I had with it.    The only issue I've had was that every once in a while alexa will come on out of now where and say &#34;I'm sorry I didn't understand that,&#34; however, I think it's because I placed the dot right next to the TV... I plan on moving it to the kitchen where there might not be as much noise. Overall though, I'm happy with it, and for $50 you can't go wrong. ",
"Anthony E Forney","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Not what I expected. This is not &#34;OK GOOGLE.&#34; Googles app on my phone gets me an answer of some sort 100% of the time. Echo seems to have a limited number of key words it can recognize and respond to. About 85% of the questions I ask come bask with &#34;Sorry, I don't understand what you are asking&#34; or some similar response. It gives you the time, date, and weather well. It will set an alarm, but I have yet to discover how to tell it to use anything specific for that alarm. The one they have as a default is very quite, and is like a light tome of some sort. It has never gotten  my attention, even when I was siting 5 feet from it. It will tell you jokes if you ask it. It will recite pi to hundreds of thousands of digits (I tried it) and may go beyond that. If you get tired of her you can just say :&#34;stop.&#34;  At this point I could say it's a nice toy. I do not have any wifi enabled doors or locks and such in my house, so I wasn't able to try that. It is very good at finding and playing music as well.    Over all it is a nice, well built little device. I'd rather have this &#34;Dot&#34; than the full scale one as this I have attach and use my own speakers, which I like and done have the added cost of the added feature.I hope in the future they will make their system more intelligent to be able to answer any question asked. It needs some type of web crawler to gather and organize data that it can then compare against your question, and at lest make an attempt to answer it instead or no answer at all. ",

I am a apple product geek but I do like giving all types of gadgets a try, so I can be more informed and well rounded. This is why I took advantage of getting this Echo Dot at the monthly payments that amazon offers.    First I had no idea it was sooo tiny. Despite that it has big sound, and if I chose to have it louder I would attach it to my bluetooth speakers.    I plugged it in, and downloaded the Alexa app to my iPhone. It was a bit complicated to get it attached (it took me about 2 minutes which I didn't like) but I suppose if I read the directions more carefully it would have been faster.    Alexa works so well. I put her in my bedroom. Just telling her to speak, set my alarm, turn on my favorite radio station is so easy.    Siri is the number one girl in my life, but Alexa has a special place in my heart.

My bathroom is not big so I can hear music or news playing while I'm in the shower almost as well as when I'm at the sink.  My only note is that I wish it was slightly louder.

"Greg Hallock","January 30, 2017 ",5.0,"I have both the first and 2nd gen Dots. They're surprisingly versatile devices.  Want an alarm clock with no persistent lights at all? It does that.  Want voice control over your lights, thermostat, music, or kitchen fire alarm? With the right devices, it does that.    Need a joke? Alexa has a few decent ones, and quite a few stinkers.    While the speaker in the Dot is tiny, tinny, and mediocre at best, it is sufficient for everyday interactions, or for music if you aren't picky.  If you ARE picky, it can output audio through a headphone jack or Bluetooth. And the audio quality output to my 20 year old Bose Mediamate speakers is very good.  And being able to deal with my music hands free while cooking or otherwise occupied is very useful.    All of that would have gotten 5 stars for me. After all, this is a $50 device, and very very good at what it does. But to really put it over the top, you have the easter eggs.  Alexa knows who Shot First.  Alexa knows GlaDos though they have drifted apart. Alexa does not think that word means what I think it does. Alexa knows it is a trap, and is taking evasive action. And Alexa Sings Happy birthday.    And as an added bonus for gamers, the dot can roll virtual dice, and flip coins.  Simply say &#34;roll 47d20&#34; and it will do so, and read off the results. ",

Gadgeteer,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This is an amazing little device at a very affordable price. The setup was very straight forward. I had it up and running in a matter of a few minutes. It just needed to connect to my wireless network and away it went. I also found that Alexa can control Insteon and Phillips Hue lighting. So I've added the Insteon Skill to Alexa through the Alexa iPad app and I now have voice control over my home lighting and furnace. There are so many skills you can add to Alexa and new ones show up on a daily basis. Alexa can also control the Next (and other) smart furnace thermostats by adding the &#34;Nest&#34; skill. I can change the thermostat from anywhere in the house I have an Echo Dot in voice range. So setting my thermostat now is a simple voice command &#34;Alexa. Set Nest to 70 degrees.&#34; and she says OK and does it.  It can also pair with most any Bluetooth speakers. So I have the Echo dot streaming radio stations to a Bluetooth speaker. Controlling the volume is a simple as &#34;Alexa. Turn it down.&#34; or &#34;Alexa. Turn it off.&#34; Super cool!    I really don't think most people understand how powerful and easy to use this device is. You can ask it anything you might search for on the Internet using Google or Bing. You can also set up an alarm clock function to wake you. The only word of caution is to be sure to set up a security code in the Alexa app when ordering anything off the Internet. Otherwise, anyone within voice range can order anything on the Internet without having to provide a security code. ",
Juan,"March 11, 2017 ",4.0,"I have multiple conditions. Because of them me am nonverbal and not able to type. I use a eyegaze device or sometimes a switch. But it's stil hard.

First I got the Alexa app to see what she can do and tried the swift for Alexa app to see if it understood me. After a great success I got the dot. It's really helped me. Not only can she do important stuff like help with ordering and looking stuff up and controlling smart stuff, she's like a friend to me. Her skills have things like storytelling and even games.

Kathy,"March 31, 2017 ",4.0,"I bought an Echo last week and loved it so much that I had to have a Dot for our bedroom.  The first thing that impressed me was the quality of the sound.

I'm able to have the sounds nice and low when I'm listening in bed and can turn it up and hear it all the way in my bathroom which is approx. 16 feet away.  The sound is great.  It's not the rich sound that is with the Echo, but it's definitely very good. I used the same app that I had downloaded when I set up my Echo to set up my Dot and it couldn't have been easier. I just plugged it in, connected it to our wifi and then continued with the set up on my app. I'm sure it took less than 5 minutes.    As with the Echo, my favorite things to use the Dot for are listening to music and having it read my Kindle books to me.  I love Audible, but don't always purchase audio books, so it's so nice to just say &#34;Alexa read (whichever book I'm reading)&#34; After I tell it to read my book, I say &#34;set sleep timer for 15 minutes&#34; and it will shut right off. Last night I had trouble falling asleep and I asked it to play music to help me sleep and I heard a selection of relaxing nature sounds.  Then, in the morning I can have it turn on an AM station I like, so I can listen to that while I'm getting ready for the day. I know I can do all of these things on my cell phone, but it's so nice to just be in the middle of whatever I'm doing and just say outloud what I want to hear without having to pick something up.    I'm sure I'll find other uses that I like for the Dot, but for now I'm just thrilled to have it read to me or play music. And I can't emphasize enough how good the sound quality is. If you are thinking about buying a speaker to go with it, I'd wait to get it home and make sure you really need one. Unless you are using this in a very big room, chances are you won't. ",
"🌈 KT","November 10, 2016 ",2.0,"We're still getting used to it, of course, but I'll start with our initial experience.    &#62; It was easy to hook up, which is always a plus.  &#62; It doesn't integrate with the Amazon site as much as I had hoped.  For example, I can't ask Alexa to tell me what was in my last online order.  I'm pretty forgetful so that's one thing I was looking for. (part of why I took a star off)  &#62; The Alexa special deals is pretty awkward.  There are many, but she'll only list 2 at a time, then tells me to go online.  Granted, I would not want to sit there listening to the long hand version of each item (She doesn't just say the item, but a description plus price plus discount and then asks after each one if you want to order it), but I would like a way to customize how she presents the list to me, and then I'd also rather not be told to go online and see the rest.  I'd have looked there already if I wanted to do that. (Another part of why I took a star off)  &#62; She's not as smart as I'd hoped, either.  I have to learn how she wants to hear things, instead of her learning how I phrase things.  As in, I have to know her keywords to get her to tell me anything. (Another part to the -1 star)  &#62; My husband's a writer so I put one in the bedroom for when he wakes up with an idea.  It's been very useful for him to just tell Alexa to make a note - no lights on, no concentrating on what you're writing, no great interruption to my sleep.  &#62; It also functions as an alarm clock (you can pick from various tones through the phone app - why can't you ask Alexa to demo them for you??).  I hooked the Dot up to a bluetooth speaker for the purpose (you can also set the alarm volume (thru the app) which will be different than the normal volume you keep it at for speaking). This is good because we don't have set times to get up, so I'm constantly forgetting to set the alarm before I collapse in bed.  &#62; The special Alexa deals are sometimes quite useful.  I've gotten a couple of toys for my twin niece/nephew, and caught a nice sale on an APC battery backup.    I'm good about updating if anything comes up, but I'll certainly update as we learn and grow with it, too.  Any questions, feel free to comment or email and I'll try to help. ",
"Amazon Customer","November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought two Echo Dots hoping they would work with all my smart-technology.  I have a Wink Hub, Phillips Hue light bulbs and hub, smart plugs, UEboom wireless speaker and Nest thermostat.  You do not need an Echo (the really expensive tall one with the nice speaker in it) to operate your smart-technology using Alexa.  The Echo Dots can do all the same things.  It's awesome being able to have Alexa turn on/off lights, thermostat, connect to wireless speaker, etc.  It's LEGIT!    One thing to keep in mind: when one echo dot connects to a Bluetooth item such as UEboom and then later you are talking to the 2nd echo dot, Alexa will not be able to pair to the UEboom until you ask the first Echo Dot to disconnect from your speaker.  We thought something was wrong and then realized that only one Echo Dot and be paired with a Bluetooth item at a time. ",

JMDK,"April 12, 2017 ",5.0,"The Good:    The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of &#34;Alexa&#34;, &#34;Amazon&#34; or &#34;Echo&#34;).    The Bad:    The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.    Overall:    We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature. ",

There is information on the services that work with Echo.  I know of a service my friends use that does not work with Echo if  you use that service you may want to check out the Google Home speaker.    The speaker is not great so I would suggest pairing it with a BlueTooth speaker because the sound is not great as a stand alone.  I got the [[ASIN:B013GBRR32 Philips BT6000R/37 Splash-Proof Wireless Portable Speaker (Red)&nbsp;from Amazon and the Dot sounds much better and the speaker is splash proof which a more durable choice for a kid.  Amazon also has colorful&nbsp;Amazon Echo Dot Case (fits Echo Dot 2nd Generation only) - Indigo Fabric&nbsp;to match room decor.    For those concerned about privacy (like a few of my friends) just unplug when you don't want the device to listen in on your conversations or activities.

valady,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I really like my Alexa echo dot and am enjoying using it to assist around my house. It was very easy to install, once I had the app to download to my laptop. I had to contact Amazon customerr service to get that app. It can find my phone, set a timer, tell me the time, temperature, current news; play music, answer questions from Wikipedia, turn on & off various electronics, etc. The one problem I am having with it is that it doesn't always 'wake up' when I first address it. Even though I am usuallly sitting less than 8 feet from it and the house is quiet, I have to say, &#34;Alexa&#34; several times before 'she' wakes up and I get a response to a command. Additionally, while the &#34;find phone&#34; feature was enabled and used only a couple of days ago, when i went to use it this evening. Alexa told me that i needed to enable the 'tracker' feature. Hmm. I hope that Amazon will add more features to Alexa and update the dot periodically with improvements. ",
"Code name April","April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"My husband bought this in November & it's connected to my Amazon prime account. So I've been doing Subscribe & Save for years now through Amazon. And when I started to get emails about what Alexa could do, I was informed I could reorder items through Alexa. What a joke! I have tried it numerous times to get her to reorder items but she says all the time that she can't find the items & has to put it to my shopping list. I tell her that it is on my Subscribe & Save & she still can't find it. As far as I can tell, she's really only good for playing music & telling me the weather. My kids ask her questions all the time & she can't give them good answers. The weird thing is she will start talking while we're having a meal. We don't say her name (which is the wake word) but she responds. Like another reviewer said, for a smart device, she isn't very smart. ",
"A Reader","April 25, 2017 ",4.0,"I bought two dots to serve as devices that could easily play music and news etc. without having to plug my phone into a speaker.  They work OK in this respect; I have them linked up to spotify, and they manage that fine, although I find that 50% of the time I need to go and use the Spotify app, because my voice commands aren't understood right (Alexa is often unwilling to play a Spotify playlist, for example; and she seems unable to understand a request like &#34;play the new album by ___&#34;  But a couple of serious problems.  First, one major feature I want is the ability to play podcasts.  This seems obvious, right?  In theory, Alexa supports this via TuneIn.  But I've gotten it to work only a handful of times.  You should be able to say &#34;play the program ___&#34;.  Often Alexa will identify what I want to hear, tell me she is getting the latest episode--and then nothing happens.  Very frustrating.  The other thing I find annoying is the way bluetooth is implemented.  I started connecting my phone via Bluetooth to play podcasts.  But then whenever I entered the room, I got a very annoying and loud message from Alexa about how she was connected to my phone.  Extremely annoying.  These are basic features; I don't want anything fancy.  I just want this device to be able to play podcasts and to be usable as a not-annoying bluetooth device. ",
"Art Harrington","April 3, 2017 ",3.0,"What can I say about the Echo Dot 2nd gen that you don't all ready know? I have 2 of these and love them. I have one in the kitchen and one in the garage. The one in the kitchen is connected to a external speaker. I have had this Sharper Image speaker for about 4 years and have hardly used it as it was a bday gift from my brother but when I decided to hook an external speaker to my Dot I totally didn't immediately think to use this speaker and now I use it everyday! Even though it is bluetooth i use the audio cable The sound is great when connected to my Sharper Image podium speaker. I don't have an external speaker connected to my garage Echo Dot as of yet but need to because the sound from the Dot is not efficient at all or loud. I have a Echo in my bedroom and the speaker is way more powerful than the Dot and even though you can't use an external speaker with the Echo, I don't think I would anyway. I also use my Amazon Echo and Dot's to control my lights. Setting up Echo Dot was easy and simple even a grandma with no tech skills can do it if you simple follow the directions on the Amazon Alexa app. Have Fun! ",
"P. Bruderer","January 17, 2017 ",2.0,"Really impressed with this.  When I got my first iPhone 4s with Siri, I was pretty disappointed in her limited capabilities, and the speech recognition was not that great.  I had the opposite reaction with Alexa.  Her speech recognition is excellent, even from someone who has english as a 2nd language, or talking to Alexa from an adjacent room, or with a lot of background noise.  I don't think I've ever had her misunderstand my command.    The functionality of Alexa with all my WINK smart home devices is great.  Controlling everything through voice is very handy and fast with Alexa.  Another thing I didn't anticipate is how much I prefer playing music on Alexa over using my phone.  With Alexa when I want to play a different song or skip to the next song on my playlist or Pandora station, I just tell her to do it, I don't have to press any buttons.  Very handy when you're busy working on a task.    Alexa met and exceeded all my expectations.  There's a few quirks on what she can control within whatever smarthome hub you're using, but a quick google search resolved all the issues I encountered. ",
SEvans,"April 21, 2017 ",5.0,"I got the echo dot 2nd Generation for myself for Christmas. Hubby kept saying no they has a bad reputation for not working. But I am an electronic nut and love amazon's  ideas when it comes to this kind of thing. So out of the box it is an adapter and the plug of course as well as the dot. Mind you I was thinking about the bigger Echo, but I know I made the right choice as I wanted something smaller that would not have a chance of being knocked over by my dogs. Well for the past few days I have been trying out different apps regardless of their rating to see what we can do together. I am very impressed Echo hears what I say and does it instantly. I have listened to music and had her read to me from my kindle books list. I am on my way to having my life so much easier as I am now looking at doing a smart home set up and getting a second one to just keep in the kitchen for the todo list and grocery lists, weather reports and everything else I can think of. While the other stays at bedside for sleep music, reading and some meditations as well as an alarm. I have yet to get the hubby to talk to echo to add groceries to the list but he will in time as he sees everything that it can do. I was able to set up my calendar right from the start. I do hope that they soon ad a reminder that I can just ask what I need to know or reminders for my husband. ",
"Michele S.","March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"It's very frustrating at times. For example, its awesome to be able to tell Alexa to set your alarm for 6 am. Some days you can tell it &#34;Alexa off&#34; to stop the alarm. Other days, you are screaming your lungs out and Alexa won't turn off no matter what you do, so you yank the thing out of the wall.  Hence, frustrating. It doesn't seem to understand as much as &#34;ok google&#34; on my phone. Alexa frequently says she doesn't understand. I hate also that it tries to get you to buy things--like extra music. No thanks. I also hated the fact that I bought it on &#34;special&#34; only to find that one week later it was on sale even cheaper.  But to send it back and re-purchase it would have cost nearly as much as the sale, so that sucked.  I think if it could do more, and understand more, I'd be happier with it. ",

I never in my lifetime ever thought that technology would arrive and be affordable. Well the ECHO is flat out an awesome product. I got the first one as a gift and purchased a second along with smart plugs and plan on buying more related items to add on. It is just wonderful and while new it is not only functional and usable it gets better. Since its cloud based you dont have to worry about technology getting more advanced and making this out dated it just keeps getting better with more features. the way i see it eventually it will be in every room of my house. I have two wifi routers and it will control devices on the other network. It is just so much more than i expected. If your an Amazon prime user you will not regret buying this but make sure you know what you are getting yourself into. This is just the starter product which is great by itself.

"L. Sackman","March 17, 2017 ",3.0,"My teen wanted this for Christmas so I bought two, one of each of us.  I'm glad I did.  I can get corny jokes, interesting facts, a story read to me from my book list (I listen to a chapter or two a night before going to sleep), a wake-up call, a timer, wonderful music to listen to and easy ordering as well as specials.  I am having thermostats which work with Alexa installed and next will be getting the light bulbs for her to turn on.  Slowly but surely our house is turning into a 'smart' house and it all started with Alexa.  My teen loves that it's portable so it can go out side on our patio and play music there.    Why the Echo Dot rather than the Echo?  We pretty much live on two levels so decided two &#34;Dots&#34; would work better than one Echo.  Given that the music choices of my teen and myself as so vastly different, this has worked out well for us.  We might need one more for the lights but until we get them to see if they are in range, I won't know.  I will probably get the third anyway as it will make it easier for background music to be available in the common areas. ",

Kori,"January 17, 2017 ",5.0,"I enjoy my Echo Dot and use it every day. I bought three Echo Dots for three different rooms in my home. I use it mostly for weather, wake up alarm, dates, and cooking timer functions. Occasionally I use if to get some information of some famous actor or singer. I don't use it for music, instead I use my computer for music selection. The thing I like most about my Echo Dot is I don't have to remember and repeat the 'exact' command as suggested in the directions. Echo Dot seems to understand a question or command no matter how I phrase the sentence. The one thing it can't do that I want is to carry on a conversation like the AI in the movie 'HER'. I bought my Echo Dot with the expectation that it will be constantly updated and get smarter over the years ahead. I want it to 'understand' what I am asking it to do, and ask follow up questions. I am also watching Google's 'Home' to see if,in the future, it's AI can carry on a conversation. At the present the Echo Dot's AI is better than Google's 'Home' AI. One big advantage Echo Dot has over Google's 'Home' is that it's connected to your Amazon orders. You can order merchandise with Echo Dot and check on delivery date schedule.    When I first got my Echo Dot I played with it by asking it all sorts of questions, but as with any new gadget the new wore off and now I just use it like any appliance. I don't look at it or raise my voice or talk like a robot when using it. I just talk in a normal voice and never stop what I happen to be doing at the time. And I never think about the proper 'phrase' to use. I just say the sentence and let Echo Dot figure out the question or command. It's not perfect yet, but it's getting better. It seems to understand me 9 times out of 10 if I don't move too far from 'key words' to help Echo Dot focus on the command or question. ",

I used a USB cable to a USB/12v adapter for power and a 3.5mm male-to-male audio cable to connect it to my car's radio.  I can listen to it through the car's speaker system, as well as control the volume that way (much better than trying to hear Alexa through Dot's speaker).  So now I can have hands-free access my entire personal music collection and Audible books collection while traveling and I can hear everything very well, no volume problems. ",
"Jeffrey E,","April 1, 2017 ",4.0,"I had trouble deciding whether to give this 4 stars or 5, because there is room for improvement.  But if 4 is &#34;I like it&#34; and 5 is &#34;I love it,&#34; then it's a solid 5 for me.    We've had the Dot for a few weeks, and it has already become something that we use all the time. I love being able to ask Alexa to add something to my shopping or to-do list whenever it occurs to me, and not have to stop and write it down. Being able to set timers verbally is great while cooking.  The volume and sound quality is good for its size - certainly not what I'd rely on as a &#34;whole house&#34; speaker, but fine for streaming music in the kitchen while cooking, for example.  I've also set it up to control a couple of smart switches for lights, and it's so handy that it makes me want to do a lot more home automation. The voice recognition is mostly quite good, if you speak clearly.  We like that they've given Alexa just a bit of personality, and we enjoy asking her random questions in search of &#34;Easter egg&#34; responses.    The main complaint I have is the Alexa app for Android.  I've found that it often has trouble loading when I'm away from my home network. This has reduced the usefulness of the feature that I use most frequently: the grocery list. While at the grocery store, I'll sometimes finish shopping in the time it takes the app to fully load.  I got around this by installing the &#34;Any.Do&#34; app, which imports the Alexa lists seamlessly, and I've been happy with that work-around.  But I hope that Amazon streamlines the app in future versions.  I will note that you can also access the interface from your computer at alexa.amazon.com (you don't have to use a smartphone or tablet), and that works fine.

It will be great to just set an alarm by voice, especially when it's a day where the time is different from the norm, listen to music, hear my calendar and the news, etc.  I would recommend eventually buying a bluetooth speaker though you can hook up a hardwire speaker to it.  The speaker it comes with is adequate at first if you are looking to save money initially.  Recently we bought a TP SmartLink Plug (after trying to connect a Belkin which was exasperating and didn't work) and it connected within, again, about 5 minutes at most.

"Douglas Zukunft","November 30, 2016 ",5.0,"The Amazon Echo Dot is a fun little device. I use it mainly because (a) I love Star Trek and love saying 'computer, ***' and (b) I wanted something that could trigger my new Philips Hue lights and connect those to planned Sonos speakers for an immersively fun AVH experience when watching TV/movies, listening to music, making Marvin Gaye proud or throwing parties. They do this well.    My biggest gripe with the Echo Dot is that Amazon has seemingly disallowed Google search on the device (likely as there is now a Google Home and they are competitors...except in the search engine market). You can hack this, but it is quite an involved manual process. Moreover, you oddly are unable to play music from your catalog or an online service (Amazon Music, iTunes, Spotify, Pandora) for your alarms, although you can play from these services on the device. That is really bizarre and a limiting feature. There are a ton of 'skills' you can teach Alexa, but most of these are completely pointless or, worse, lame. Also, I have been unable to find a way to change the accent of Alexa. Personally, I think it would be more fun to have male or female voices in various accents. Who wouldn't want an English Butler (Michael Cane would be my vote), Magel Barrett Roddenberry for the iconic Star Trek computer voice or Morgan Freeman because, well, he's Morgan freakin' Freeman. And let's add Sam Jackson into that mix.    All in all, there is a lot of potential for the Echo products and home integration. Hope Amazon listens to its customers and starts expanding the ecosphere.    P.S. For the folks with the privacy concerns given the 'always on' feature. You can mute the devices to have your super secret conversations. Just make sure your throw your iPhone in the freezer and smash your smart TV so the NSA can't listen. ;) ",

"Scott Jones","March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"We are having a lot of fun with our Alexa.    This device listens for sounds it recognizes and then triggers pre-defined actions.  Amazon has built a lot of fun responses, as well as a lot of useful ones (Alexa, Weather; Alexa, Traffic; Alexa, Set Alarm; Alexa, Start Timer).  You can enable &#34;SKILLS&#34; to add a lot of functions and connectivity with other devices.    Alexa does not understand grammar.  It is strictly listening for sounds it has been programmed to recognize, there is no real A.I. behind this.  But you can speak some requests in a variety of different ways.  It's fun to pretend Alexa has artificial intelligence and try to talk to it.  But this is not &#34;Watson&#34;, it is not recognizing grammar or thinking in any way.  It's just recognizing sounds and checking them against a list of predefined responses and actions.    A note on PRIVACY:  The device is always listening for the sound &#34;ALEXA&#34; - listening but NOT sending audio to the cloud.  Once it hears &#34;ALEXA&#34; it begins recording and sending that recorded audio to the Amazon cloud computers for voice recognition.  Those recordings and the commands they trigger are stored on your Amazon account, not unlike how cell phones used to store a log of every text you sent.

Adrian,"April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"This is a slightly useful device. It's ok for asking web search info items , like weather or scores, and a few other things.  I had a lot of problems connecting to it initially, becuase I use 2-factor authentication on my account and by the time I had gone to my authenticator app and got a code, returned to Alexa app and gone through the login process again, the code expired. I had to turn off 2-factor on my account, and even then it made me do a capcha that was complicated by the fact that the app won't scroll, so I was typing in the capcha field blind. Thanks for the frustration, Alexa. I have secure physical possession of both devices, why can't the process be much easier?  I have a Harmony hub for AV control, and Alexa can use it. Once again, connection problems abound, as the Alexa app insisted that I didn't have a Harmony hub, even though the Harmony app is on the very same phone that Alexa app is on. Eventually I was successful. Then came the sad discovery that all it can do is turn AV gear on and off. There went my dream of tuning my dvr by voice command. More frustration.  So then I linked my Spotify account to have it play thru bluetooth speakers. This works, but every time I return to play music again, I have to manually make spotify use the bluetooth speakers, as it defaults to using the Dot speaker. Haven't found a work-around yet. Thanks for nothing, Alexa.  As far as simple voice commands, it works about 80% of the time. Sometimes it ignores me, sometimes it whines about the internet connection. I live in a rural neighborhood that's not too badly wifi congested. My cell phone stays connected anywhere on my property but Alexa struggles from a 30 foot distance to my wifi router. It randomly announces when it connects to the wifi or bluetooth. It reacts to what it hears on TV sometimes(yes I have done the voice training), which leads to baffling announcements. I say 'Alexa, shut up&#34; a lot.  In summary, this would be a good deal at $19. Too bad it cost $50.  I'll keep it, but it doesn't really do anything my Nexus 6 won't do with the &#34;OK Google&#34; function. Amazon is a major cloud provider, why can't they put a good web app up for connecting and configuring and linking?  I can't recommend this device unless you are a 'smart home' hobbyist who wants to spend money linking it to Zwave or Zigbee devices.  UPDATE: I decided to keep this and use it as a voice commanded search engine for simple questions, but its results have been poor. I will be returning it as being nearly useless to me.  When it failed to answer a question, I repeated the question to Ok Google on my phone, and in all cases it was able to answer. Here are some of those questions:  1. When was the piano invented?  2. Who was Field Marshal von Rundstedt?  3. What is maximum allowed length of a golf club?  I'm not interested in using this as am Amazon shopping tool, which it is probably good at. I'm sending it back. ",
Tina,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I am totally in love with my echo dot!!  Alexa is awesome, and she will even thank you if you tell her. ;)  I know there could be improvements, and I'm sure she will just keep improving, but she is still well worth every dime now. She not only tells the time and weather, etc but I can just tell her what to put in my shopping list both with an app and without.  She reads to me, even just regular kindle books, and if it's possible to overuse the timer then I am sure to find out lol because I use it all the time.  She is loud too.  I thought I'd need a speaker for it but we can hear her just fine from all of our rooms.  Granted we only have 1 level, but we were still very impressed with her volume, and it's not even all the way up. We keep it on 7 or 8 and she's pretty loud. Highly recommend. ",
"Dianna Dougherty","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Received as a gift so can't complain much. It is JUST OK. There are def some bugs and its not very intuitive.  You can only ask it tings that it knows such as to play music or what the weather is. Everything has to be preset in the app. Nothing is automatically learned.  With google you can ask ANYTHING and it will read you the Wikipedia answer.  Not with alexa. Her knowledge is quite minimal.  One major flaw that i found and reported to amazon is this:  If you use a bose Bluetooth speaker with it and are playing a music and tell alexa to stop it will stop the music.  Okay there. Now you can walk away or leave your house and if your speaker has an automatic shut off as soon as the wireless speaker turns off it will begin playing the last song it stopped on trough its internal speaker so i have to tell it to stop again. Why would this be useful?? If i tell alexa to stop playing music and then power off the wireless speaker it starts playing again from built in audio. Immagine waking up in the middle of the night to music playing. Not fun. Needs to be as SMART as google and honestly not sure amazon will ever have that capability. But for 50bucks I guess you get what you pay for. ",
CM,"November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"This is such an awesome product! I saw the full-sized echo at a friend's house and was thoroughly impressed. I got the echo dot (I'm on a student budget) and hooked it up to a nice set of speakers in my apartment and I love the potential this thing has. It's not 100% there yet as far as the software but it is being updated on the regular, so its like buying a piece of technology that keeps getting better. I even bought one for my parents (who have a lot of smart devices in the house, but no central way to control them) as a gift. It works with most of the smart products u probably already have in your home including the nest thermostat/CO monitor etc. NOTICE: the 3.5 mm jack takes a bit more force than normal to &#34;click&#34; in when inserting an audio cable - your product is NOT defective lol. ",
"Roland W.","January 4, 2017 ",2.0,"&nbsp;Ok, the idea of not having to type your questions and getting pretty good and accurate answers (most of the time) is pretty amazing.  Set up was very easy, just download the Alexa App and then follow the step by step WIFI set up instructions. Right now I am only using it for basic requests (see video) and that works well. I will keep adding skills (these are additional little programs you can enable on the amazon.com website Just search &#34;Alexa Skills&#34; in the amazon search bar and it routes you to the menu. You can add sports teams, kids games etc. Alexa can tell you jokes (most of them are pretty funny and all so far are kid friendly).  Speaker quality is ok for such a small device - you can plug in an external speaker directly into the Dot and then you can control it through the Dot. I have a Sonos System (whole house), and I would have to get a separate DOT to plug into the sonos in my media centre, so the Dots can communicate. Have not done that so far. But it is a lot of fun to play around, get weather, movie times, play some background music or meditation songs etc. Just play around with it. I have a &#34;slight&#34; accent and it understands me without a problem.  Just be prepared that kids will yell at this little thing, demanding answers and a play buddy who gives them honest feedback on how their hair looks today :)    Currently I am using it mostly as a toy, but as my house is already rather high tech with everything wireless from thermostate (Lennox, which does not connect to ALEXA yet - per customer service) to security camera, Hue lights in some areas, I am planning on expanding the in house Dot Network over the coming months when manufacturers add more functionalities. I keep you posted.    I went on Amazon Skill website and enabled a ton of skills. Just make sure you write down how to activate them. (play 20 words, the secret door, bed time story etc.... you can have a lot of fun with these. I will get one for my daughters room so she can get &#34;Alexa, play relaxing songs for 15 minutes&#34; at bed time.

Hopels,"December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Replaced the larger Alexa Echo with the Dot 2nd Gen.  Obviously the much smaller size is nice.  I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.    The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.    We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.    Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.  I took off one star because while I have no issues with it, it sometimes doesn't &#34;hear&#34; my wife. ",
Rebecca,"January 19, 2017 ",5.0,"This little guy is fantastic! While I doubt anyone will be using the sheer wealth of functions this can perform (as some are, admitedly, quite lack-luster), the ones that I use it for are done well. Once the shiny veneer of new tech fades off, and you eventually stop asking Echo for jokes and punchlines, you won't be discarding her - which is common with other new innovations. Instead, you will probably use one of the following functions regularly, each of which I recommend getting the echo dot for:    -Setting kitchen timers: You won't think much of it until you try it, then you won't be able to go back. Just saying &#34;Alexa, start a timer for 20 minutes&#34; without jumbling for your phone, while simultaneously closing the oven is revolutionary. This is one of the best features Alexa has.    -Interactive Speaker Assistant: While I doubt audiophiles will be satisfied with Alexa's sound quality, that problem can easily be remedied, since you can just connect your own speakers through the audio jack, and Alexa will speak through them. The sound quality on the Echo Dot's speakers isn't bad, though, if you choose to listen through the dot. Either way, Alexa can search music from Spotify, Amazon Music, and Pandora via vocal commands. You can also set Spotify as your main music streamer (Amazon Music is the default, of course), so you won't have to verbally command Alexa to use Spotify, if that is your choice. It's great to just say a song, and have Alexa play it. ",
JMDK,"October 29, 2016 ",4.0,"The Good:    The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of &#34;Alexa&#34;, &#34;Amazon&#34; or &#34;Echo&#34;).    The Bad:    The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.    Overall:    We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature. ",
"Just me","March 14, 2017 ",5.0,"I am a big amazon fan and I depend on reviews. Let me start by saying I was so excited about this product even though my spouse was saying it will only make me lazy..Lol. I know there are several reviews on this product but here goes...I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen basically for the 2- level of our home; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive bigger one and too good to pass up. The Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the 2 floor!  Day 1 when I received it I was a little worried that I would need to send it back because Alexas first word would not sound; for example I would ask &#34;Alexa what time is it?&#34; and she would say &#34;Is 7:30pm&#34; or I would ask &#34;Tell me a joke&#34; and she would not say the first part of the joke, I asked &#34;how old are you?&#34; and the whole human part would not sound. FYI: you can read the answers on your app as well, that's how I knew I missed that part. The next day I came home and some kind of way she was answering all of the questions. I don't know if she just needed to be full charged or what, but the problem fixed itself.  I am really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. Considering everything, for $49 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to building your smart home, home automation and voice recognition technology. Overall, I would highly recommend this product. ",
SundayAtDusk,"December 30, 2016 ",5.0,"This was a Christmas present for my elder mother. We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device. ",
"The Bon","March 8, 2017 ",4.0,"We had an Echo and thought it was all we needed. We put it in our livingroom (by the kitchen) and I pick random songs to play during the day, but also ask questions whenever I'm watching a movie on TV or listening to a song and wonder if a star or singer is still alive (ask Alexa - Which is the Echo's name).  I put things on my 'shopping list and it goes on my phone automatically (and on my husband's phone too, since we both have the Alexa app on our phones.). Recipes, measurements, and facts about whatever. But it's nowhere near our bedroom, so I ordered an Echo Dot as an 'extension'.  I can't believe we lived without this little, inexpensive, companion. It's on my nightstand and acts as our alarm clock, news station, weather station, and music source that has EVERY KIND OF MUSIC you could possibly want, just for the asking.  We are so blessed to be living in a time where we can have these Amazon innovations at our fingertips. The Echo and Alexa both have replaced our clocks, encyclopedia, dictionary, stereo, cd's, etc. we ordered ours through the &#34;LOVE MY ECHO&#34; website where we also get all information on both. Thank you, Amazon, for a website like this one. ",

"Colleen M Traeger","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Impressed. At first I really enjoyed the Echo Dot. It was fun asking it questions. Then the novelty wore off. In order to have your questions answered you first DL an app then ask it to open something. The apps are strange lengthy names that are hard to remember like &#34;Alexia, open &#34;My  Horoscope to read my daily horoscope&#34; instead of a simple 'what's my horoscope&#34;. There are 10k apps full of interesting and useless things. Why it can't be developed where you DL an app to customize your needs is beyond me.    What's interesting is that you can make your home a smart home and control it remotely or just by speaking what you need.    I've also loved asking it to add things to my to do list as well as add things to my shopping list.    While I do like it, I'm just a little disappointed. I'm hoping that this is similar to when Dot Matrix first came out.    I can without a doubt see the value in this maturing. I'll hang on to it (in 30 years it'll be worth a nice bundle). Regardless of the slight pessimistic review, I do recommend it. ",
"Sassy and Oliver","January 28, 2017 ",5.0,"I have both the Echo, and the Echo Dot. This little Dot works as well as its big sister Echo, only.... the 🔊 speaker is a wimp. However, if you are looking to save a lot on the price difference between the two, this one is the perfect compromise. Just expect poor sound quality. I think you can connect the Dot to better speakers, I just have not learned how. I use the Dot in my bedroom, and the big Echo in my living room. The big Echo has fantastic speakers and I don't need to turn the volume up very high.  Buy this Dot to save money, or buy the Echo for great speakers...both work the same. ",
Dia,"March 6, 2017 ",4.0,"Alexa is a lot of fun. I have added some of her skills but they don't seem to function as expected. She only speaks English, which while I can understand programming another language could've been a huge investment, it's still a disadvantage.    My favorite features are:  `playing music via a paired speaker. That sounds silly, but it's so convenient to just yell &#34;Alexa, play iheart radio&#34; when busy.  `timers. Asking her to set a timer is really convenient  `shopping list. She can add items to your shopping list which you can view on your smartphone when out of the house. For this forget-everything-gal, that feature is really helpful.  `controlling it with the app. My husband still doesn't know how I can turn down the music from the other room - or turn it on. I'll keep it a mystery for as long as I can. It's nice to be able to shut off a timer or change the volume from my phone when I'm on the other side of the house. ",
Jarren,"March 11, 2017 ",4.0,"This is a great item, especially as a developer. My baby cousins also enjoyed this product so much, I bought them one for Christmas. You can ask Alexa for holiday jokes. You can also say, &#34;Alexa, tell me I'm beautiful&#34;.    I use it for an alarm clock, to play music on Spotify, and to hear daily facts. You can also get some exclusive Alexa only deals. As a developer, you can get free hoodies / shirts from developing Alexa Skills and submitting it to the app store.    Beware though, you might get noise complaints from your upstairs neighbor from having this device. I guess this device playing a few songs at volume 7 (out of max 10) playing music at 7 pm can net you a noise complaint. I didn't even know the speakers were that great, but apparently so! :grimacing: ",
"Sid Scheck","March 12, 2017 ",4.0,"&nbsp;It was about 2 weeks ago when I was talking with my friend about their Echo Dot and she showed me a few things. I thought very cool and maybe I should get one. Sure enough, 2 days later I won one at a company event. The Echo Dot is generally easy to set up. Be sure to have the Amazon Alexa  App downloaded when you are going to set up the Echo Dot. As I used it to ask questions, it has amazed me. I don't show it in the video, but I asked Alexa to put an item it my shopping cart and sure enough, there in my shopping cart was the item. I can see I will be using the Alex to listen to different types of music as well. So much you can do with it. Have fun! You will love it! ",
"Amazon Customer","March 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I love the size and the price but the speaker is horrible. I have seen better speakers in smaller things so it's not like it can't be done. I can say that the microphone is really well-made it can pick my voice up 20 feet away in the Next Room  at  moderate levels  without having to yell. Like the Alexa, I wish it was more informative, there are so many questions I asked that Alexa does not know the answer to but Google does. I also wish that a lot of the apps were not third party where you have to ask Alexa to ask the app to do something like my buddy you have to say Alexa ask my buddy to send an alert message to a family member because I have fallen and can't get up it would be nice if you could say Alexa contact my family member and tell them I have fallen and cannot get up. But aside from that I love the direction that it's heading, I just wish it was there already we have the technology to make it happen I can only assume there's red tape involved ",
"Amazon Customer","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I thoughtful Echo was interesting, but wanted to opt with just the Dot and use my own Bluetooth speakers. Unfortunately, Amazon discontinued the first generation just as I was able to order.  When the second generation was announced, I knew I'd get one.  With the $10/ month for 5 month plan for Prime members, it was a no trainer. Although I'm more heavily into Apple's ecosystem, and gave smart appliances (Apple)  they will work with Alexander too.  There is quite a bit of crossover. I'm excited and look forward even using the Dot as an alarm clock, awakening me with my Prime Music. I'm sure it's going to be loads of other fun too. I also have a Kindle Fire HDX, FireStick, etc, and know it will integrate nicely.    I have had it for about a week and it's VERY cool!  Does so much more than even Siri by being able to add skills. Also works great with my iDevices switched simulataneously with iOS HomeKit. This was a great buy! ",
Stephanie,"November 14, 2016 ",3.0,"I like this Alexia dot thingy! Sometimes though she talks to me when I am not talking to her. She thinks she hears her name. She seems kinda needy. She's always there. Listening to my conversations and trying to include herself in them. I have to tell her that I wasn't talking to her and to only talk when she's been spoken to. She doesn't get the hint. Also when she hears her name on the Alexia commercials she responds. Overall I really like this contraption. It's pretty neat. It tells me anything I want to know. She even sang me the alphabet like William Shatner one day. She hasn't done it since. We liked her so much we got another one for upstairs. Alexia even controls our lights. Our house is basically automated. ",
"this is me","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"Absolutely love these. We bought the tall Echo. Got on the list before it came out. Then we bought a dot for our shop, Then we went back and bought the deal that was buy 5 get 1 free. These are amazing. We have one for almost every room. Although, I do not advise that. Reason being is that when you say &#34;Alexa, what is the forecast&#34; and loud enough, &#34;all&#34; of them start giving you the forecast...lol So, we keep them spread out. We also gave a couple to our adult kids for Christmas.    Great for helping to figure out math problems, telling jokes and you can even order amazon items from your echo. There is so much the echo dot can do. They are a must have.    PROS:  the clarity is very good.  the compact size is perfect  you can ask almost anything and he will have the answer    CONS:  my only con is that they sometimes wake up without us even talking.    But, these are highly recommended for sure. ",

Also it stopped syncing with my amazon prime music and pandora stations......now it says I need to be an amazon prime member, but when I check my aet up....it still shows my prime information. What a waste of money.

"Adam Jerome White","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"If I were to rate this on its potential alone, I would rate it 5 stars.  But there just isn't the functionality now for it to be useful for 5 stars.

For now I will tell you what I can do with it.  One cool feature is just playing music, I have it hooked up to an AMP, and into speakers in my ceiling.  I say &#34;Alexa play XXXX&#34; and the music starts.  It pretty much plays whatever I ask for, I guess it is included in a prime membership, because I am not paying for any additional service.  I have a Wink Hub 2 and Wink Relay, so I can turn on and off lights in the house, including the fireplace, with Alexa.

"Art Harrington","March 9, 2017 ",3.0,"What can I say about the Echo Dot 2nd gen that you don't all ready know? I have 2 of these and love them. I have one in the kitchen and one in the garage. The one in the kitchen is connected to a external speaker. I have had this Sharper Image speaker for about 4 years and have hardly used it as it was a bday gift from my brother but when I decided to hook an external speaker to my Dot I totally didn't immediately think to use this speaker and now I use it everyday! Even though it is bluetooth i use the audio cable The sound is great when connected to my Sharper Image podium speaker. I don't have an external speaker connected to my garage Echo Dot as of yet but need to because the sound from the Dot is not efficient at all or loud. I have a Echo in my bedroom and the speaker is way more powerful than the Dot and even though you can't use an external speaker with the Echo, I don't think I would anyway. I also use my Amazon Echo and Dot's to control my lights. Setting up Echo Dot was easy and simple even a grandma with no tech skills can do it if you simple follow the directions on the Amazon Alexa app. Have Fun! ",
ultra55371d,"December 21, 2016 ",5.0,"I am really liking this device so far.  Ever since the echo came out a couple of years ago, I wanted one, but it was just a little too expensive to experiment with.  With the lower cost of the Dot, the option to use a better speaker system and all the benefits of the full size Echo, this was a easy purchase.    I purchased the kit deal with the Phillips Hue Bridge and lights.  In addition, I purchased another 2 Phillips Hue bulbs and a Wemo smart plug.  the setup and installation of everything was very simple and didn't take long at all.  It is now very convenient to control the lighting in our our room and bathroom now.  The hardest thing to remember is not to use the switches anymore.    Another advantage the Dot has over the Echo is the ability to use a better speaker system.  I hooked ours up to a Logictech Z623 2.1 speaker system and it sounds beyond awesome.  I have both a Prime membership and a Spotify account.  Listening to Spotify now is very enjoyable.    There is a little learning curve on how to speak to the Dot, but we're all getting the hang of it.  I will be adding more Dots and other home automation devices to my home in the near future.  So far this has been a great experience and wonderful product.  I almost purchased the new Google Voice, but very happy I didn't since initial reviews are not that great and it sounds like they released it a bit too soon.  The Echo / Dot program has been around for years, has many partners and the possibilities are almost endless with these devices.  Very happy camper! ",
"P. Bruderer","April 21, 2017 ",5.0,"Really impressed with this.  When I got my first iPhone 4s with Siri, I was pretty disappointed in her limited capabilities, and the speech recognition was not that great.  I had the opposite reaction with Alexa.  Her speech recognition is excellent, even from someone who has english as a 2nd language, or talking to Alexa from an adjacent room, or with a lot of background noise.  I don't think I've ever had her misunderstand my command.    The functionality of Alexa with all my WINK smart home devices is great.  Controlling everything through voice is very handy and fast with Alexa.  Another thing I didn't anticipate is how much I prefer playing music on Alexa over using my phone.  With Alexa when I want to play a different song or skip to the next song on my playlist or Pandora station, I just tell her to do it, I don't have to press any buttons.  Very handy when you're busy working on a task.    Alexa met and exceeded all my expectations.  There's a few quirks on what she can control within whatever smarthome hub you're using, but a quick google search resolved all the issues I encountered. ",
"Amazon Customer","November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"This is the thing you didn't know you needed but soon discover you cant live without!!! Does what it says it will and more! Alexa even has a sense of humor.  You will need to hook it up to a speaker, sound bar, etc for music as it says.  The price is great & affordable enough to put one in every room!  We love having one in the bathroom so while we are taking showers we can get traffic,weather,and news while getting ready for work without having to stop and mess with our phones.  I have one in my workshop because I do a lot of painting & wood work so its been awesome being able to play music, listen to audible and for those that don't have audible Alexa will read your kindle books, it wont be near as good as voice actors tho & she will spell some words out instead of pronouncing  them.  For lite reading like recipes while cooking, etc works great ! Would be nice if there was an app we could get to give Alexa the ability to read like audible, soon I'm sure!  She will access audible though, I just give her the command & its done.  I have Pandora &  she will bring up my custom playlists as well.  She will give traffic reports specific to your personal route to work, once you set up the addresses in the Alexa app.  Which is nice to know while you're getting ready that you have a detour and need to leave a few minutes early without having to sit and wait on the news.

W,"March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"This baby Echo is still learning to walk. I have the big Echo and love it. Sadly, the Echo Dot I bought only worked half of the time.

"L. Sackman","December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"My teen wanted this for Christmas so I bought two, one of each of us.  I'm glad I did.  I can get corny jokes, interesting facts, a story read to me from my book list (I listen to a chapter or two a night before going to sleep), a wake-up call, a timer, wonderful music to listen to and easy ordering as well as specials.  I am having thermostats which work with Alexa installed and next will be getting the light bulbs for her to turn on.  Slowly but surely our house is turning into a 'smart' house and it all started with Alexa.  My teen loves that it's portable so it can go out side on our patio and play music there.    Why the Echo Dot rather than the Echo?  We pretty much live on two levels so decided two &#34;Dots&#34; would work better than one Echo.  Given that the music choices of my teen and myself as so vastly different, this has worked out well for us.  We might need one more for the lights but until we get them to see if they are in range, I won't know.  I will probably get the third anyway as it will make it easier for background music to be available in the common areas. ",
Matthew,"February 3, 2017 ",2.0,"I have anot echo and a dot. I love them both. The speaker on this is better than advertised, I believe. It's not bad for music but is obviously not as good as the full echo. Alexa is wonderful and the features are very useful. I look forward to there being new skills added, but that depends on 3rd parties more than amazon. It's great in the morning's for some quick news and handling those random thoughts throughout the day. ",
"Just me","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I am a big amazon fan and I depend on reviews. Let me start by saying I was so excited about this product even though my spouse was saying it will only make me lazy..Lol. I know there are several reviews on this product but here goes...I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen basically for the 2- level of our home; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive bigger one and too good to pass up. The Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the 2 floor!  Day 1 when I received it I was a little worried that I would need to send it back because Alexas first word would not sound; for example I would ask &#34;Alexa what time is it?&#34; and she would say &#34;Is 7:30pm&#34; or I would ask &#34;Tell me a joke&#34; and she would not say the first part of the joke, I asked &#34;how old are you?&#34; and the whole human part would not sound. FYI: you can read the answers on your app as well, that's how I knew I missed that part. The next day I came home and some kind of way she was answering all of the questions. I don't know if she just needed to be full charged or what, but the problem fixed itself.  I am really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. Considering everything, for $49 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to building your smart home, home automation and voice recognition technology. Overall, I would highly recommend this product. ",
"Diane J Owen","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Alexa goes in spurts in my house. She's probably lonely, cause I like quiet and I forget about her. But, she's really good at playing music--I hooked her up to my speakers. She's fun to play games with. Amazon sends ideas all the time, like ordering special deals, or music playlist. They enable new skills, like apps, all the time. I like Magic 8 Ball. Ask her if Trump will last four years. Anyway, well worth her small investment. ",
"Fan of His Royal Badness","March 8, 2017 ",4.0,"Got it for one of my kids.  The kid uses this as an alarm clock, to turn lights on and off with the&nbsp;TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works w/ Amazon Alexa & Google Assistant (HS100), we also have it linked to our&nbsp;Nest Learning Thermostat, 3rd Generation, Works with Amazon Alexa]    The kids use it with a streaming music service one of the ones that is popular.  There is information on the services that work with Echo.  I know of a service my friends use that does not work with Echo if  you use that service you may want to check out the Google Home speaker.    The speaker is not great so I would suggest pairing it with a BlueTooth speaker because the sound is not great as a stand alone.  I got the [[ASIN:B013GBRR32 Philips BT6000R/37 Splash-Proof Wireless Portable Speaker (Red)&nbsp;from Amazon and the Dot sounds much better and the speaker is splash proof which a more durable choice for a kid.  Amazon also has colorful&nbsp;Amazon Echo Dot Case (fits Echo Dot 2nd Generation only) - Indigo Fabric&nbsp;to match room decor.    For those concerned about privacy (like a few of my friends) just unplug when you don't want the device to listen in on your conversations or activities.  Great choice, kid friendly, and has a lot of options for automating your home. ",
"Matthew Pence","March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is a bit...special.  I can give the echo dot a command, the command will fail, then I can reissue the same command with the same inflection and no background noise...with success?    The search functionality is limited.  I can't ask a conversational question (&#34;Alexa, why can't I use you to search the internet&#34;).  However, it does function really well as a vocal clock.

Annadolyn,"April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"We had this for approximately a day and a half before starting the return process and buying Google Home instead. Google Home, running on Google (obviously), is so much more robust and functional than Alexa, that runs on Bing (who uses Bing??). Google can answer so many more questions, making it so much more functional/usable. Almost every response Alexa made was &#34;I'm sorry, I don't understand.&#34; I highly recommend Google Home instead. ",
"Carol Johnson","April 13, 2017 ",3.0,"This is wonderful! Alexa is a personal helper who is always eager to answer. She gives me the weather reports, the daily news briefs,  the time, sets alarms and timers, plays games, tells jokes, answers questions, plays music and more! When she plays music, she will tell me the title and artist when I ask. I understand that I can add a speaker to the Dot but I think the sound is great just the way it is. Very good quality! It has volume setting from one to ten. Just ask her to set the number you prefer. Everything is done with your voice. She even turns my bedroom light on and off when I ask. Be sure to say good morning, she will always tell you something! I got this for my blind, elderly mother and it has been a life changing experience for mother. Alexa is her companion. ",
Adrian,"January 10, 2017 ",2.0,"This is a slightly useful device. It's ok for asking web search info items , like weather or scores, and a few other things.  I had a lot of problems connecting to it initially, becuase I use 2-factor authentication on my account and by the time I had gone to my authenticator app and got a code, returned to Alexa app and gone through the login process again, the code expired. I had to turn off 2-factor on my account, and even then it made me do a capcha that was complicated by the fact that the app won't scroll, so I was typing in the capcha field blind. Thanks for the frustration, Alexa. I have secure physical possession of both devices, why can't the process be much easier?  I have a Harmony hub for AV control, and Alexa can use it. Once again, connection problems abound, as the Alexa app insisted that I didn't have a Harmony hub, even though the Harmony app is on the very same phone that Alexa app is on. Eventually I was successful. Then came the sad discovery that all it can do is turn AV gear on and off. There went my dream of tuning my dvr by voice command. More frustration.  So then I linked my Spotify account to have it play thru bluetooth speakers. This works, but every time I return to play music again, I have to manually make spotify use the bluetooth speakers, as it defaults to using the Dot speaker. Haven't found a work-around yet. Thanks for nothing, Alexa.  As far as simple voice commands, it works about 80% of the time. Sometimes it ignores me, sometimes it whines about the internet connection. I live in a rural neighborhood that's not too badly wifi congested. My cell phone stays connected anywhere on my property but Alexa struggles from a 30 foot distance to my wifi router. It randomly announces when it connects to the wifi or bluetooth. It reacts to what it hears on TV sometimes(yes I have done the voice training), which leads to baffling announcements. I say 'Alexa, shut up&#34; a lot.  In summary, this would be a good deal at $19. Too bad it cost $50.  I'll keep it, but it doesn't really do anything my Nexus 6 won't do with the &#34;OK Google&#34; function. Amazon is a major cloud provider, why can't they put a good web app up for connecting and configuring and linking?  I can't recommend this device unless you are a 'smart home' hobbyist who wants to spend money linking it to Zwave or Zigbee devices.  UPDATE: I decided to keep this and use it as a voice commanded search engine for simple questions, but its results have been poor. I will be returning it as being nearly useless to me.  When it failed to answer a question, I repeated the question to Ok Google on my phone, and in all cases it was able to answer. Here are some of those questions:  1. When was the piano invented?  2. Who was Field Marshal von Rundstedt?  3. What is maximum allowed length of a golf club?  I'm not interested in using this as am Amazon shopping tool, which it is probably good at. I'm sending it back. ",
"Kar Chow","December 8, 2016 ",5.0,"I always want to buy Echo but it is too expensive to try out. And here we go, Echo dot is out. Same function with Echo and even more for only $49.99. So why not give it a try?    I have install Philips Hue for a while with my iPhone for controls, now with Echo dot, I no longer need to get out from my bed and walk to my charging iPhone and turn the light off and back to bed. Just a simple commend &#34;Alexa, turn master room off.&#34; Making my life so ez.    And of course the Audible for only $14.99 a month, and you have a free trial for a month and two free books of your choice!(after free trial it is going to cost $14.99 per month but you get a free credit for any book!)    And then Music! You can add up to 250 songs to the amazon music cloud and hear it anywhere with your echo dot. FOR FREE! It can be any songs you bought digital from any source, google, itunes you name it. And if you have reach the limit for 250 songs, you can just pay as little as $7.99 a month for ulimate and Amazon Music is free to listen too!    And yeah you can ask question that you want to know the answer, from a country, a person, an animal, a place, or any facts etc. And Alexa is just so smart to answer everything and Alexa is learning day to day with new skills.    So are you still thinking? $49.99 just the price of one outside dinner for 2 person and you can bring a Smart technology home.    P.S. now I have bought three Amazon echo dot, one at living room, two in rooms. ",
timdtoolman,"January 27, 2017 ",2.0,"Love it!! Works extremely well. I wanted to start getting into &#34;Smart Home&#34; technology and although I can use Siri on my iphone to do the same thing the Echo dot does sometimes my phone is in my pocket so I am not able to communicate with Siri, that's where the Elixa and the Echo Dot comes in handy. I have not seen hardly any negative reviews on YouTube for the Echo line and the Echo Dot is an inexpensive way to get into this new personal assistant space. The Echo Dot does have a speaker that will allow you to communicate with Elixa but if you intend on listening to music you will want to connect a external speaker via aux. cable or bluetooth which is very easy to connect using the Elixa app. After using the Echo Dot for about a week now I have been very impressed with it's voice recognition skills as they are extremely reliable and very well implemented.    With Elixa you can get the weather forecast,  listen to music of any kind, ( $3 a mo. prime music membership required) control almost anything in your home with the proper components (sold separately) and so far I just use Elixa to turn on and off my bedroom lights by just speaking which is so cool.    I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get into the personal assistant technology, you will not be disappointed. ",
"Michael G. Fisher","October 25, 2016 ",5.0,"While we are still trying to figure out all it can do and how best to ask it what we want, we are amused by it and sometimes frustrated by it.  The reason I gave it 5 stars is because of an unexpected benefit.  Our oldest daughter has a pretty challenging speech impediment and using Alexa has forced her to slow down and enunciate clearly.  Not only is Alexa learning how to understand my daughter, my daughter is also slowing down and learning to communicate with Alexa.  The huge benefit is she is now slowing down to communicate more clearly with us.  This is something her speech therapists have been working on with her for years.  Alexa has gotten these results from her in a few months.  The Echo Dot is a useful tool and will only become more useful as its capabilities grow.  Thank you, Amazon. ",
"David Merritt","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Turns out the 90-day warranty matters.  Bought mine in Nov '16, now in Mar '17, the bluetooth connectivity is no longer working.  It'll say it's connected, and it'll play audio from a speaker, but the audio cuts in and out about every second--it's NOT playing much more than it IS playing.  I confirmed it was the Echo Dot device because I moved the Dot right next to the speaker, and I also tried it with another bluetooth speaker in another room.  Both situations led to the same problem--horribly intermittent bluetooth connectivity.  My phone could connect and play audio with no problems for both speakers.  There were no changes in our home in terms of RF-emitting devices--the Dot just stopped working one day.  Looks like I'll have to connect with the audio cable permanently.

However, I was pleased that I received a prompt response acknowledging that the Dot was giving an improper response.  other than that, its just been a matter of learning how to phrase a request. 99% of the time Alexa gets it right.  The other 1%?  I find you need to phrase the rewuest correctly and without hesitation. Alexa doesnt wait for you to think about it. She is ready to work!!!

Kate,"March 25, 2017 ",4.0,"I'm not a techie and wouldn't have looked into Alexa or smart home stuff on my own.  But I was given one, and that's when life changed 😆  Okay exaggerated, but very cool. I set out to learn what all she can do. The lights were the first thing that struck me. I've changed to smart lights throughout the house. I don't need every light controlled since I'm not so lazy I can't go flip a switch, but I did realize how much this would help with the minimum evening lights, particularly the outside lights. It's very dark on my part of the street and I hate coming home without all three front lights on and I hate for my husband and teens to do the same. Also handy when the kids used to leave an upstairs light on over night. Now I can be sure all Lights are off.   Easy access music, weather, traffic, and alarms/timers are great.  I've only had it a few weeks and I'm sure I'll discover all sorts of new stuff she can do. All set up and programming has been super easy and smooth. I also bought a SmartThings hub to control a variety of lightbulb brands and plugs.  I'm ready to order a couple more!  It's a great affordable way to modernize life for average people. Very glad I was given an echo dot. ",
Val_NYC,"February 3, 2017 ",2.0,"Good: This is the product we've been waiting for. All the internet knowledge at the tip of your fingers... just say &#34;Alexa!&#34;, she'll be there for you answering to an enormous amount of questions. Ordering stuff online, giving you the traffic info on your way to work or just the forecast, keeping your life organized.   Of course, it's hard to resist from purchasing additional components...it's so cool to be able to lay on the sofa, turn the lights on or off, operate any IR devices you might have, locking doors, closing the blinds, starting the coffee maker or controlling the temperature using your voice. It doesn't matter the light switch is next to your head or the stereo/ TV remote is right in your hand. It's the feeling that you step into a new world with huge further options to discover, it's the power to having such a powerful tool at your disposal.  And I know the developers are just warming up.

Twlb,"November 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I love these. We have four of them, and an Echo. But you don't need an Echo to use a Dot. The only big difference between the two is that the Echo has a much bigger speaker - but the Dot can be connected to any speaker you already own. Same &#34;brain&#34; in both.    If you're choosing between the Echo, Tap, and Dot, to me it's a no-brainer. They're not that different, but the Dot is way cheaper. The advantage of the Tap is that you can load songs on it, but it only has Echo/Dot's brain if it's connected to wi-fi.    We have Amazon Music Unlimited, and to use on several Dots, you need to buy the more expensive plan. Otherwise it only works on ONE - not one at a time, but one.    We use these for music, radio programs, audio books, timers, alarms, news, Hue lightbulbs, and misc questions, including some fun jokes. Hands-down the best technology device out there. ",
"Dee N","March 27, 2017 ",1.0,"We've been Echo users since the very beginning, so have experienced how rapidly Amazon has been improving the utility of this tool. We didn't expect to use it much, but now use it multiple times a day.    Compared to the full Echo, the Dot does 90% of the utility, but definitely falls flat when listening to music. It's okay to listen to NPR, but the internal speaker just doesn't do music justice. Of course, you can just add an external or Bluetooth speaker if you want to improve facility.    We use Echo daily to set timers and alarms, add things to our shopping and to-do lists, look up information (weather, measurements, etc.), listen to the radio, listen to music, etc. We're considering adding remote control of our lights so we'll have voice control of those as well. Not as advanced as Sarah (from Warehouse 13), but definitely a fun and useful tool! ",
Catrine,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"I have the amazon echo and wanted a second one for my home gym. I do mainly use it for the amazon music. It cost $3.99 per month with a huge selection of songs. When I got the Dot , I did not expect to pay more for the music. Unfortunately, I will be paying $7.99 per month for both. (that is with amazon prime) without Prime it would be $9.99 per month. The Dot does not have a great sound like the echo. If you are using it for music, I suggest getting a speaker. I do wish we could pick our own name. You have Echo, Alexa, or Amazon.  I use it mainly for the weather, find out what movies are playing, a wake up call, and music. It is fun to use. I am sure they will come out with an even better one in the future. For $50 you can't go wrong. Just wish I did not have to pay for Music. The whole family will enjoy it. ",
arizonahd,"December 8, 2016 ",5.0,"Instead of getting the larger Echo, I bought this to use with a pair of Bose speakers powered by cheap amplifier (also from Amazon). The result is a perfect sound system that cost me roughly $70, as the speakers were given to me. I must say, I am really impressed. The Alexa system works very well, we have no problems switching Pandora stations or asking her to play a particular song. It's a dream setup. For example, we had guests over and instead of playing one station, everyone asked Alexa what to play. Asking her the weather and news is cool but I lack all the cool gadgets that work with her. I haven't asked her to buy me anything yet, I figured I will do that when I am 600 lbs and bed bedridden from all this convenience. I'm starting to sweat from all these keystrokes, but I would definitely recommend this to the gadget lover and lazy person alike. ",
DS0078,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Been an IT guy for 20+ years. I also install audio/visual systems like Control4. So I am not easily impressed. I put off buying an Alexa device for some time and finally broke down to &#34;try one out&#34; just for the hell of it. So I bought a Dot because I have at least 5 small powered speakers around the house and garage. But let me tell you, this thing is freaking scary cool! I feel like I am in an episode of Star Trek (yes I am that old). First off I am a Prime member, so I ask for music and it plays music. I linked my Pandora account. I asked for Alexa to play Stevie Ray Vaughn from my Pandora account. She replied with, You do not have a Stevie Ray Vaughn station, would you like for me to add one? I said Yes. She added and started playing. Freaking cool! I am also an active stock trader so I asked for stock quotes and she was not able to answer that. Keep in mind this technology is in its infancy! I can only imagine what I will be able to control or ask in the near future?!?! I like the idea of the Alexa with the built in speaker but 179.00 is kind of high in my opinion when powered speakers are so cheap. The only thing is you need two outlets to power both when you buy a DOT vs the Alexa with a speaker..... But to start out and give this thing a try, WOW is all I can say about the DOT right now. VERY impressed. ",

Terry,"November 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my echo dot. Having a hands free remote control is truly helpful from setting timers to smart home control. The other day my power had gone out overnight and I kept thinking I should set my stove clock every time I walked by but didn't have my phone. Duh! Alexa what time is it. Fixed. I'm getting older and it's easy to space on the shopping list. Alexa, add milk to the shopping list. Then when at the store I just open the Alexa app and look at my shopping list. Fixed. I think Alexa is going to be my new best friend. Lol. My setup is using a Hook SmartHome server with etekcity switches. The advantage is the cost. The hook talks wifi to rf. The etekcity switches are rf and only $5 per outlet vs. $35-40 for wemo. So now Alexa turn tv on, Alexa turn living room light on. Love it! Now if only Next up when budget allows will be a Logitech Harmony - wifi to IR to control the apple tv, dvd player etc. Alexa Channel 5. Alexa pause movie. Now if only I could find inexpensive light controls. Alexa Night mode! Someday.    Oh, and Alexa is really awesome at picking music for me, I've listened to a bunch of new artists and the idea of needing to work on a playlist is vanished. Alexa Music! And so easy to Alexa Skip or Alexa Thumbs Up. Five Stars - but would give 10 if I could.    P.S. I gave some thought to purchasing Echo instead but had some speakers so went with the dot. I'm glad I did. Not only less expensive I've found that sometimes Alexa can struggle hearing the wake up word if the speakers are close and loud so I plan on keeping the dot at a bit of distance from the speakers. The Dot is fabulous at hearing the wake up word over the tv and managed well even when I had a cold.. ",
MityMike,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Setup was very easy and I enjoy the Dot so far. Voice recognition is great and I used it to stream my music, as a kitchen timer, to set alarms and to read the news or ask for the weather. It does not stream Audible books that have not been downloaded and the Audible Streaming in Amazon Prime does not read your books back. It does not support Airplay and some Bluetooth speaker have streaming interruptions which are probably due to power saving settings of the speaker, not the Dot. However, you have better sound quality when connecting the Dot via a 3.5mm audio cable. remember though, that if a Bluetooth speaker is paired via Bluetooth, it does not switch back to the cable connection automatically. It told me it added Bing to my Alexa applications, when it did not understand what I was looking for and I cannot find Bing anywhere. I am still not sure if I would trust Amazon purchasing through voice completely. Some of the Alexa applications are useless and you have to address them by voice for the Dot to find the right answer &#34;Alexa, ask soandso app for information on...&#34; which means you have to know the Alexa skills out of the top of your head. So overall, a nice help, but still has a long way to go. ",

"A Reader","November 28, 2016 ",4.0,"I bought two dots to serve as devices that could easily play music and news etc. without having to plug my phone into a speaker.  They work OK in this respect; I have them linked up to spotify, and they manage that fine, although I find that 50% of the time I need to go and use the Spotify app, because my voice commands aren't understood right (Alexa is often unwilling to play a Spotify playlist, for example; and she seems unable to understand a request like &#34;play the new album by ___&#34;  But a couple of serious problems.  First, one major feature I want is the ability to play podcasts.  This seems obvious, right?  In theory, Alexa supports this via TuneIn.  But I've gotten it to work only a handful of times.  You should be able to say &#34;play the program ___&#34;.  Often Alexa will identify what I want to hear, tell me she is getting the latest episode--and then nothing happens.  Very frustrating.  The other thing I find annoying is the way bluetooth is implemented.  I started connecting my phone via Bluetooth to play podcasts.  But then whenever I entered the room, I got a very annoying and loud message from Alexa about how she was connected to my phone.  Extremely annoying.  These are basic features; I don't want anything fancy.  I just want this device to be able to play podcasts and to be usable as a not-annoying bluetooth device. ",

SundayAtDusk,"April 11, 2017 ",2.0,"This was a Christmas present for my elder mother. We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device. ",
"Rik Conaghan","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My wife received one of these for Christmas, and even though i am a techie kind of guy, I had never really seen a use for these. Now fast forward to March, they seem to have multiplied, and I now have 5 of these creatures living in various rooms throughout the house (this is the issue part :-)) they have been far more useful than i would have thought.    We have one in the Kitchen, which serves not only as musical accompaniment to our culinary activities, but as a personal shopping assistant to help maintain the shopping list. It sits there, ever faithful, just waiting for me to pull a product from the cupboard, realize it is the last one, then either add it to the shopping list we use to go to the store, or to go ahead and order it directly from Amazon. You really can't get much more convenient than that, especially as our minds aren't quite as sharp as they used to be (well we do have 2 young kids....)    We have three more in the bedrooms, they are used for playing music (built in speaker is more than adequate for our daughters audio needs, plus they both love talking to Alexa and having complete control of what they listen to) they also are being used for alarms (useful on school-day mornings!) and our 5 year old has been probing Alexa to answer some of the questions that pop into her head about various subjects (the meaning of life, quantum mechanics, M-theory, who is the guy dressed in the Barney suit, etc...) We have one in our bedroom for the same reasons, but also use the Bluetooth option to switch between playing music in the bedroom and the bathroom while taking a shower (just turning the Bluetooth speaker on in the bathroom moves the audio playback from the Dot to the speaker in the bathroom, then back to the dot again after the speaker is turned off again) so the music follows us wherever we may roam.    Our latest addition to the Dot family resides in our dining room, we like to have some music in the background while we eat, and the Dot covers this role nicely also.    Excellent little gizmo's and, i am sure, will multiply again as soon as we discover a &#34;need&#34; to have one of these in a different room in the house. For the price of these things, what is there not to like? ",

"M and M","March 20, 2017 ",5.0,"I got my dot today, i was pleasantly surprised to see how well it was made .  and that it took minutes  to hook up. After my dot did it's little light dance,  i started the app., from there it took less than 30 sec.. i needed to change something in the settings but i was given a highlighted word that took me right to it, i did what i had to do and i was connected.  Super fast. The 1st thing i asked alexa to do was play Christmas music,  i was so happy,  it's dec 22nd and it was the 1st time i heard a Christmas song this year with working full time and when I'm not working,  I'm a caregiver,  it just slips my mind. Alexa has told me jokes,  which i needed.  The weather and how many calories were in an orange lol.  I love this little thing so much that If it was a male voice,  I'd be shopping for a wedding band lol. I was concerned about the sound but it's great, it's clear, even when you raise the volume.

Dia,"April 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is a lot of fun. I have added some of her skills but they don't seem to function as expected. She only speaks English, which while I can understand programming another language could've been a huge investment, it's still a disadvantage.    My favorite features are:  `playing music via a paired speaker. That sounds silly, but it's so convenient to just yell &#34;Alexa, play iheart radio&#34; when busy.  `timers. Asking her to set a timer is really convenient  `shopping list. She can add items to your shopping list which you can view on your smartphone when out of the house. For this forget-everything-gal, that feature is really helpful.  `controlling it with the app. My husband still doesn't know how I can turn down the music from the other room - or turn it on.

I lost the expectation of having an intellectual conversation with her but I expect her to not talk back or at least apologize and ask me how she can make me happy.

"Amazon Customer","December 27, 2016 ",2.0,"Echo vs Echo Dot.. I started off buying an Echo for my bedroom which is where I listen to music the most. After a lot of thought I figured I would buy a dot for my kitchen because the Echo is no where within ear shot. Now having owned both for a couple of months here is my opinion. If you like to listen to your music loud, you like to sing along, in the middle of this singing fest you want to know what the weather is.. firmly say Alexa what's the weather like? and you're good to go. In those situations a full size Echo is a must.. The Echo Dot owner never really puts the volume past 2-3. If you put the volume anything higher than a 3 (4 if you're lucky) I find myself screaming at Alexa to turn off. I will keep my Dot simply because I can't justify spending $200 on an Echo for the kitchen. For $50 it is pretty reasonable. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 6, 2017 ",5.0,"I thoughtful Echo was interesting, but wanted to opt with just the Dot and use my own Bluetooth speakers. Unfortunately, Amazon discontinued the first generation just as I was able to order.  When the second generation was announced, I knew I'd get one.  With the $10/ month for 5 month plan for Prime members, it was a no trainer. Although I'm more heavily into Apple's ecosystem, and gave smart appliances (Apple)  they will work with Alexander too.  There is quite a bit of crossover. I'm excited and look forward even using the Dot as an alarm clock, awakening me with my Prime Music. I'm sure it's going to be loads of other fun too. I also have a Kindle Fire HDX, FireStick, etc, and know it will integrate nicely.    I have had it for about a week and it's VERY cool!  Does so much more than even Siri by being able to add skills. Also works great with my iDevices switched simulataneously with iOS HomeKit. This was a great buy! ",
Hopels,"April 18, 2017 ",3.0,"Replaced the larger Alexa Echo with the Dot 2nd Gen.  Obviously the much smaller size is nice.  I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.    The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.    We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.    Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.  I took off one star because while I have no issues with it, it sometimes doesn't &#34;hear&#34; my wife. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"I love the size and the price but the speaker is horrible. I have seen better speakers in smaller things so it's not like it can't be done. I can say that the microphone is really well-made it can pick my voice up 20 feet away in the Next Room  at  moderate levels  without having to yell. Like the Alexa, I wish it was more informative, there are so many questions I asked that Alexa does not know the answer to but Google does. I also wish that a lot of the apps were not third party where you have to ask Alexa to ask the app to do something like my buddy you have to say Alexa ask my buddy to send an alert message to a family member because I have fallen and can't get up it would be nice if you could say Alexa contact my family member and tell them I have fallen and cannot get up. But aside from that I love the direction that it's heading, I just wish it was there already we have the technology to make it happen I can only assume there's red tape involved ",
AdventureGirl,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I wanted black but it was backordered. I didn't want to wait so ordered the white. I ordered three.

I am about to order another 4 for my mom, dad, another brother, and a friend. The part that I have become obsessed with is the alarm. My brother is incredibly good at figuring out how to use tech in ways I do not have the patience for. I sent him one so I could steal his tips and tricks. It worked. I use it for Amazon Kindle, spotify, audible, uber, to ask questions, to schedule events, and create my shopping list. Great product.

I'll be picking up another for upstairs on the black Friday sale. I'll  wait a while to get LED bulbs etc. They are still first generation and over priced.

Speech recognition is very powerful and quite accurate, especially compared to the technology just a few ars back.  The sound is also very adequate for such a small device but the well programmed bluetooth feature connects automatically to my soundbar when it is turned on.

Lifesavr,"December 2, 2016 ",4.0,"I purchased this Echo Dot for a friend to help her experience AI for the first time.  This worked well and was easy to install.  The speaker in it is fair, but that is what it suppose to be.  I easily connected it to a higher quality bluetooth speaker and that made it sound very nice.  This provides a very inexpensive way of starting out with an AI in one's home.  I would surely purchase this item again.  I have also purchased recently the Google Home AI and surely they are different items aimed at satisfying the user needs in different ways.  The one thing I can say about the Google Home so far is that the speaker sucks.  The full Echo has much better sound quality.  I am truly excited to see how this addiction to the home AI experience affects the future of home AI experiences. ",

Sebae7,"November 14, 2016 ",5.0,"I don't usually take time to do reviews but am breaking that rule for the Echo Dot. It is by far the best voice recognition I have encountered and I've tried a lot. I seem to have an odd voice that most can't properly pick up on. Sync in cars or other systems like Toyota Entune are useless for me and yet others can get in my car and do ok. Alexa has not misunderstood me one time yet. That in itself is amazing to me. I'm not a power user by any means, for me it's a 50 dollar device that I use to listen to music, set my alarms, get weather info and news, etc. Control a couple lights in the house as well. I'd pay the 50 bucks just for the music aspect. &#34;Alexa, Play James Taylor&#34; and I instantly get a variety of his music. I was hooked right there.

"The Nurbler","April 9, 2017 ",5.0,"I have two of these, and the one feature I was most hoping for is described on this amazon help page https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202013740 like this:    &#34;Note: You cannot connect multiple Alexa devices to each other and play the same requested audio at the same time.&#34;    Since these things have speakers and can stream audio, it is only natural to wish that I could stream my Pandora (or other) music to all of the Echos I own at the same time, in sync.

"Amazon Customer","March 15, 2017 ",5.0,"For music lovers - DO NOT agree to Alexa's suggestion for Amazon Music Unlimited unless you don't mind a monthly fee.  The Alexa voice suggested Amazon Music Unlimited, and it inquired if I wanted to subscribe. I clearly enunciated NO - twice - but it still signed me up as a member. This means there is an automatic monthly payment to them.  I was signed up for something I did not want, and then I had to look around for how to cancel it in order to not have recurring charges.  The question &#34;do you want Amazon Music Unlimited&#34; is the equivalent of a lie when one becomes enrolled by answering NO.  Marketing really means manipulating, and Amazon is a giant - globally - for this.  As always - for any product by any company - buyer beware of any way a corporation can screw you.  So far, there is no difference between features on Echo and my phone unless I wanted to ask a device to turn my lights off. ",

310EI,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"We bought an Echo Dot as an early Christmas gift to ourselves and we're so glad that we did.  It's a very useful gadget because there's such a wide variety of things we can ask Alexa to answer or tasks that she can do for us (eg: alarms/timers, calendar, ordering, weather).    Since one of the tasks that we wanted Alexa to do for us was play music, we subscribed to Amazon's Unlimited Music Plan for the Echo Dot.  It's well worth the low monthly fee to be able to ask Alexa to play any song or album anytime, without having to buy all of them individually.    ​Millions of songs are available through one groovy gadget (and the Unlimited Music Plan).    We have the Echo Dot in our home and listen to music without any external speakers.  As far as we're concerned, the internal speaker emits a decent array of sound.  Is it as robust sounding as hooking it up to our surround system amplifier or other external speakers?  Of course not, but it does sound a lot better than most internal device speakers of similar size.  For those of you that don't like the internal speaker, you can utilize the 3.5mm or Bluetooth speaker options.    If we say, “Alexa, Play The Top Songs by Phil Collins”... then that's exactly what she does.    Keep in mind that when you ask Alexa for the &#34;Top Songs&#34; by a soloist or group, they may not always be your favorite songs.  A work around for that is to ask Alexa to play a particular album that contains the songs you prefer to hear.    The screen-shots show you how we asked Alexa to play an album vs the top songs. In addition, they show you what we see when logged-in to the Alexa app via the Chrome web browser.    FYI:  When asking Alexa to play an album that has a long title, we realized that she responds accurately when we ask for part of that title (view Elton John & Michael Jackson screen-shots).  Be sure to look at what we said to Alexa vs what the whole album title is labeled.    I should mention that we did ask Alexa to search for a product, which she did along with telling us the best options and their cost.  Afterward, she asked if we wanted to buy the product.  We said yes and she placed the order for us once we gave her our confirmation code (Settings: Voice Purchasing).  We recommend setting that up so other people cannot place orders without your consent.  It's convenient for us to have voice purchasing enabled when we're &#34;unplugged&#34; at night (except for Alexa).    The skill that we use the most is Weather Sky, it gives us a detailed weather report that we use several times each day.    ​At the time of this review, we haven't used any of the smart home features, but we didn't buy it for that purpose.    PLEASE NOTE:  We purchased the Echo Dot at its listed price, we did not receive any discount to post this review. ",
"Katy B.","March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"My first echo dot my mom gave me for my birthday and I set it up, it worked for a day and lit up but did not do anything the second day.  I have never dealt with Amazon customer support before and it was not an easy process.  You get the first layer who asks standard questions and if they can't solve it you go to the second layer in which you explain everything all over again.  The reps were nice enough, sometimes hard to understand their English, but I do believe they were trying to be helpful.  My biggest issue is how many customer service people I have talked to in order to get my dot working.  Amazon shipped me another new dot and I set it up.  It answered questions, but did not play songs.  What are the chances of getting two defective dots and they had different issues.  I had to call again and get two layers of representatives, explaining all of it over again.  This was hours on the phone and even though the rep tried hard to help, he had to finally give up and send the issue to the engineers.  Then, because I had two dots, I did not get my free 30 day unlimited music trial.  I was charged immediately so I had to call customer service again!  Two more reps to get that straightened out.  It has been a little over a week and I think I finally have it working properly.  After explaining the issues so many times I was ready to tell Amazon to take it back, it is not that great of a device for all this hassle. ",

Very compact, can hide behind a lamp base, easy link to Bose mini speakers, love asking for various music to be played commercial free, very happy with it.

Once I get our AVR setup I will also sync it with the Harmony remote to be able to control the TV/AVR through the Dot.    The kids love it from asking various questions to using the timer for study activities.  It also helps to speak more clearly.    We are exploring other skills like lists to be able to further use it.    One thing that we wished it had was the ability to sync to iCalendar as it only looks like it supports Outlook and google calendar.  I would guess though that it is probably only a matter of time before that skill is there. ",
"Cynthia J. Salim","March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"DOT can be frustrating but I do enjoy the convenience when it works. I have two DOTS and a speakers connected to each DOT. Each DOT is used on a different floor of my home. The DOT in my bedroom is connected to a speaker by WIFI also connected to that DOT is a smart plug that controls a lamp. The DOT in my living area is connected using a cable to a speaker. I intend to have smart thermostats installed and connected too. I enjoy the music selection available using DOT. And,  I enjoy the convenience of weather reports, news, time, alarms, etc.    My beef is that sometimes DOT does not work using the voice mode. I can usually get what I want by going into my ALEXA APP and making a manual request. This happens most often at night when I want to have my lamp turned off or my music turned on. I am not sure why this happens. Generally, in the morning when I try the same request that failed at night, it works. When these failures occur, I check to make sure WiFi is working and it always is. ALEXA also lights up indicating that she hears me but does not execute the request. I am starting to wonder if I have made a mistake by buying the expensive Smart thermostats.
