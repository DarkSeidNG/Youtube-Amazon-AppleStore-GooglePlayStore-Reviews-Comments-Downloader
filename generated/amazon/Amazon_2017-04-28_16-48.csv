nycebo,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I've been wanting an Eero for a long time, ever since it was first announced. The idea of having a mesh network just sounded so appealing. By the time that I finally got around to buying one, a couple of competitors had popped up. The most promising of them is the Luma. So, I actually bought both mesh routers and will proceed to review and compare them here (a copy of this review will be posted on both the Luma and the EERO product pages).    DESIGN  The Eero hardware is really awesome. As others have mentioned, it looks like something that Apple would design. Very glossy white and sleek looking. The routers are small squares that lie flat and have power and network cables coming out the back. There's also a USB, presumably for NSCs or printers. Eero also gave extra thought to maximizing radio antenna efficiency: the tops of the routers are modestly rounded to prevent users from putting glasses or other items on top of them (and thus obstructing strong signal).    The Luma hardware is pretty nice also. Actually, the honeycomb is pretty handsome on a bookshelf and I like that it comes in different colors. BUT, and this is a big bug, the Luma is meant to stand on edge. And, when the power and network cables are plugged in, it's unsteady. This doesn't matter too much if your first router is in the fiber closet, but it'll fall over somewhat often out in the open and look the eyesore.    Edge to Eero.    SETUP  I have Verizon FIOS fiber running at my home. Setup was pretty easy as I just plugged one end of a network RJ-45 cable into the ONT and then the other end directly into the &#34;first&#34; router. Luma apparently also allows for ethernet backhaul, but Eero doesn't at present. Regardlees, I don't use that feature so it's not relevent to me. Moreover, I doubt most buyers of this product will use it either. Anyway...    The Luma was set up first. Things went pretty smoothly. I downloaded the app from Android Play store and created an account with username and password. Remember to log into your old router and release the IP address for your ISP. Then I just followed the instructions on the app: powered down the old router, powered down the ONT (aka modem), plugged the network cable into the ONT and the Luma hub, and then plugged them both in. The Luma app on my Google Nexus 6P found the hub immediately, named it and asked me to sit patiently while it registered on the network. Sadly, that never happened. I tried one more time...no go. A quick search online revealed that some Android devices have difficulty. So, I tried setup with my Google Nexus 9 tablet and voila! It registered and I had wireless network. For the next two hubs, I used an old iPhone and things worked very smoothly also. So, perhaps it just didn't like my Nexus 6P. Small bug but no harm done.    The Eero set up was also smooth....after I figured out how to release my IP address on the Luma (see below). Basically, I had to power down the ONT and wait a couple hours. Once I did, setup with my Nexus 6P was quick this time round. Again, I downloaded the Eero app and created an account by entering my telephone number and then entering a 6 digit SMS code. The Eero hub was named, registered and had live internet. Good to go.    I'll call this a tie despite the Nexus 6P hiccup with Luma. But if you have a Nexus 6P and want to use a Luma, be prepared to need to try a different device for setup. If you're a stickler, edge to Eero.    THE APP INTERFACE  Right off the bat, both Eero and Luma apps are sparse. If you're used to configuring a wireless router in the past,  you will be unpleasantly surprised by the absence of desired features, including dynamic DNS, QoS, IP release, etc. However, I recognize that these devices are supposed to be family friendly and that they are. Following the instructions in both apps is super easy and very efficiently and quickly gets the first wifi puck up and running. NOTE: I must emphasize that the Verizon FIOS ONT needs to release the IP address in order to switch routers. If you don't release it, then you need to sit around for 2 hours with it powered down until does so automatically. This shouldn't affect most users who just buy either the Luma or the Eero. But, if you are planning on testing a couple devices, it's wise to remember.    Anyway, at this point, both apps look very similar and clean with their router status view, upload and download speeds and devices attached tab. Furthermore, they let you add new routers to the mesh network easily, name them (although Eero allows for custom names), reserve IP addresses (in advanced settings menus), enable port forwarding, assign wireless devices to a user profile, UPnP, etc. Here's where they differ:    The Eero app allows devices to be nicknamed (a super nice feature), allows for a custom DHCP, and allows DNS config if you want to use Google or OpenDNS or whomever.    The Luma can't do any of those at present. However, it does allow for IGMP Snooping to be enabled or disabled. Luma also offers a rating filter for all or specified users. I don't know what the movie-like ratings mean but it would seem handy if I had young kids to whom I wanted to restrict content.    In the end, they are both pretty similar. If I had to give one an edge, it would be the Eero simply because it allows nicknames for device connections. I dig that.    Minor edge to Eero.    SIGNAL  Okay, a lot of words to get to the part that matters most. How is the signal? Alas, this is really hard to quantify. Basically, I walked around all of the rooms in my home with the Wifi Analyzer app and took readings. On average, the Eero was about 2-5 db better than the Luma in each room. Having read some reviews online, perhaps it has to do with the extra 5Ghz antenna. Who knows? But, it was a pretty minor discrepancy and may have had more to do with how the hubs hand off the connection to one another (or don't) than actually signal strength. I will say this, BOTH Eero and Luma very capably covered all corners and rooms of my home. That alone is a tremendous victory compared to my sad history with range extenders that just never satisfied us at all.    So, minor edge to Eero but very satisfactory marks to both.    THROUGHPUT  After writing the above, a big surprise here. No bones about it but the Luma just clobbered the Eero. I have no explanation for this, especially after Eero's signal advantage. Basically, my devices would connect to the Eero hubs admirably and all looked well, achieving 120% of my Verizon FIOS bandwidth. But, after an hour or so, throughput would just plummet to about 10-30%. Badly. It made me crazy. Browsing was bad. Streaming was very difficult. My wife (who doesn't care about these tests at all) would complain and ask what I was doing to the network. I ensured that I was running the latest version but it didn't seem to resolve anything. I power-cycled everything. No success.    The Luma, on the other hand, functioned well. It would test at 100-120% of my FIOS bandwidth and almost always stay there, even if I ventured to far corners of the apartment. It made streaming on multiple devices, browsing, downloading, and music MUCH nicer than I have ever had in the past. And, the wife didn't complain. All is not rosy though. With some music sources, Luma needs a little attention. Sonos (Pandora and TuneIn Radio) ran into buffering pauses every so often. I'm hopeful that they can resolve this soon.    So, I don't have a good answer for why this was the case...especially since a lot of other users have raved about Eero. Perhaps the signal just doesn't steer my devices to the faster frequency connection. Candidly, even the 2.4GHz shouldn't have an issue. It was just curious.    Edge to Luma. But remember that you might not have this experience and I wasnâ€™t going to waste more than a weekend trying to nail down the issue.    PRICE  Because of the intro pricing for pre-ordering the Luma, it was $250 cheaper for me than the Eero. These devices are already pricey compared to traditional routers so it matters.    Edge to Luma.    FINAL RESULTS  Here's the rub, since Luma cost much less and functioned better, I just ended up keeping it. Yes, the little hexagons aren't as aesthetically pleasing but I can't have complaints about video quality on Netflix and Amazon Prime. Since we don't have cable, HD streaming is very important. So, while others have had good success with Eero, I just can't affirm their experiences. Unless you have extensive streaming requirements or network throughput needs, I think that Luma should suffice nicely. And for the price, it's a no brainer...even if it is only $100 less than the Eero now.    But, and it's a big but: both manufacturers really need to keep stepping it up in development. The apps and features are way too vanilla at present. Good signal and performance will only get you so far with more advanced users.    EERO (3 stars)  LUMA (4 stars) ",
"eero Support","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Fantastic and game changing.  I have a large old brick home that requires internet on three floors.  Here is a list of the wireless routers that I purchased in the last three years and that did not work to provide reliable wireless in our home: (1) Airport Extreme (2) Netgear N900 Wireless Router, (3) Linksys EA9200.  In a failed attempt to make these three different wireless routers work I also added a Netgear range extender and used an Securfi Almond as a wireless range extender.  None of these combinations provided reliable wireless internet throughout our home.  Sometimes everything would work and sometimes some devices would get kicked off the network and could not login without rebooting everything.  The range extenders often did nothing.  Before I purchased eero, I was unplugging and restarting my modem and router at least once a day. Even at its best, I could never reliable get devices to work that required a reliable and strong wireless connection. In particular,  I have 5 Nestcams that would rarely stay connected for a full day. They require a very strong and reliable wireless connection to work.  Also, WiFi calling on my AT&T iPhone does not work unless it has a strong 5ghz wifi connection which I never was able to achieve consistently in my home.  I have approximately 30 different devices connected to our network at any time (5 iPhones, 2 iPads, 2 apples TVs, 1 Roku, 1 iMac, 2 MacBook Air's, 8 Sonos speakers, 5 Nestcams, 1 Peleton bike, 2 printers, 2 backup hard disks etc.) and in order to get all this stuff, I had to hard wire as many of them as possible directly to ethernet because wifi was never reliable enough.    eero has changed everything.  It took less than an hour to set up 3 eero units.  Everything worked on it immediately (Note: you have to restart your modem as instructed and unplug an restart any ethernet switches).  We have wifi in every corner of every floor of our house.  Every Nestcam has worked continuously without fail and I have full wifi calling on my iPhone.  The eero app (which is fantastic) lets me check the status of my network from anywhere and has shown 60mbps of download speed, 5mbps of upload speed and all three eero units online since the moment I plugged them in. My family has never been happier.    ps If anyone wants any of the routers or extenders the eero system replaced, let me know and I will send them to you for free (picture attached).    Update as of June 26, 2016: since the day I set eero up in April, I have never touched it. I have never had to reboot it or restart it. I have never lost internet connectivity for a minute. No other router I have had has worked like this. ",
"Mr. Truth","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Feb 8, 2017 update:  They just released the 2.2.0 firmware update yesterday.  It is supposed to have fixed delays in switching access points when roaming, down to something like 50ms, among other things.  This problem affected people using WiFi calling on Apple devices, where the call might drop if moving about.  Also, I did notice streaming apps would lose connection when the connection dropped.  It does appear to be better, but have yet to extensively test, but support page feedback looks very positive.  They do update firmware every month or two, and actively post on their community and reddit pages.  One positive I want to mention is that streaming performance outside, where I used to have serious issues by the pool, appears to be much better now than with my old (but recent) Apple router, even though the main node is placed in the same room as before (and is closest to the pool).  Looking forward to seeing how well this works this summer.  So while there are cheaper options out there, this does have very good customer support and a much more mature product than something like the Google WiFi.  Also noticed that Wifi signal is unaffected while a microwave oven is on--I was able to stream on my phone while sitting right next to it, which is a pleasant surprise.  One more thing.  Be wary of critical reviews containing outdated info, especially the featured ones here.  Firmware updates move quickly (for the networking space), so you should really go to the Eero community support or reddit pages to get the most current feedback so you don't pass over the product due to negative reviewers who won't update/remove their reviews because they'll lose their up votes.    Original:    This replaced an Airport Extreme and 2 Airport Express extenders. One issue with the old setup is that when moving around the house, devices would stay locked with degraded unusable connections for too long and not switch. Another is that I needed to get streaming to work flawlessly because I am planning to add multiple Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera 2 pack. Once I added a Skybell HD I could see issues because that device gets bogged down an unreliable without a very robust WiFi signal. While moving the Express around helped, I could still see the signal strength fluctuate even when connected to it, just located on the other side of the wall. Also, with one Nest cam streaming continuously, there would be hiccups with that stream when the Skybell was also recording. All these issues seem to have disappeared since installing the Eeros, and now I've ordered another two Nest cams and upgraded the Skybell to use full 1080 video instead of degraded 480 or 720 options.    Installation was very very easy. I mean not a single issue with the Eeros themselves, but I did disable/enable Wifi on two Macs and reboot of a Slingbox 500. I appreciated that they allow you to do configure some advanced networking features, and while there does not appear to be user configurable QoS yet, their web page says there is a basic implementation in place, and that they may offer more capabilities.    Even if you don't buy this mesh networking product, most people would be better off with one over a traditional router because these vendors are actively competing on features and performance with aggressive firmware updates, and the only thing a tradition router will get is a once in a blue moon security update. On that note, I would discourage people from an Orbi, since that appears to be a gussied up Netgear with the latest specs. Once you take a look at the browser configuration interface, it will be very familiar to anyone who has had a Netgear router, devoid of any imagination or cutting edge features or modern interface. No useful info about clients offered. At least for the Eero, I could not find a single review claiming the routers needed periodic rebooting, as we are all accustomed to, even with the Apple products (though better than Dlink or Netgear routers).    Eero is the one recommended by Leo Laporte, as I saw on his feed, though since Eero is a sponsor, objectivity could be compromised. I was seriously thinking about the Amplifi since the router itself is uber cool, but I had issues with the very large satellites and their orientation, as well as a number of reviews suggesting things like poor performance or quality control issues. One thing that sold me about the Eero is their claim that their implementation performs active routing, as you will see on the blog post explaining the TrueMesh technology. So if one node is busy, it can reroute traffic to another, which makes these satellites behave more like routers actually employing an active routing protocol. From speaking with Amplifi tech support, I was not convinced that the roaming functionality would work seamlessly, but I can't speak from first hand experience. While I might buy and try still, so far I'm content with the Eeros.    Let me say that some of the earlier reviews, say pre-Nov 17 2016, do not have the benefit of using the 2.x firmware. I fully expect many reviews addressing performance as a concern are out of date since they don't reflect current reality. My unit shipped with 1.2 firmware, and once I updated to 2.1, the WAN throughput doubled from 55Mbps to 110Mbps, my ISP limit. I may pay another $10 per month to upgrade my ISP speed once I get enough Nest cams to tax my upper limit (11Mbps) on the upload. From the Nest webpage, each cam at 1080p uses 450 Kbps (0.45 Mbps) upload on average, and 1.2Mbps max, so really I should be well under the ISP max with a number of camera streaming. The 802.11ac protocol, used by the Eeros, supports 1.3 Gbps, or 1331 Mbps, so for anyone curious, the protocol between the Eeros should have more than ample room to support numerous 1080 streams, plus a 4K stream with ease.    Upgrading firmware was easy--I just pushed the option in the IOS app to upgrade, and it proceeded to upgrade all three devices. Even those with recent purchases may not have taken the initiative to update the firmware, so that is something to consider when reading reviews since most people don't report what they are using.    I did seriously consider the Google Wifi, but was concerned about the immaturity and lack of any advanced features. It might work for average users, but for instance, from what I read you cannot even specify a preferred subnet. While perhaps that might change with future updates, with the Eero you get a maturing product, versus a very new Google product. The one concern I have with Eero is the high price.  I guess you would want to buy this if you want superior customer support with a lot of attention placed on advancing the product's capabilities.  And probably because it is, at this point, more mature than a number of recent offerings.    One thing that bothered me before purchasing was the lack of line of sight that they recommend. My primary router is in a corner room, and not central in the house, and invariably goes through drywall covered walls. I was researching Power over Ethernet to use a a backhaul to the Eero satellites, but decided to setup and test without POE. So far, I can say I don't see a reason I will ever need to use POE with these existing two satellites. One issue with what I found on POE products offered on amazon is that I would be worried about periodic rebooting and troubleshooting of those devices. So my advice for anyone similarly concerned about line of sight is to try it naked first and figure out a way to place within rooms that minimizes obstructions. Obviously, anyone with Cat 6 interior cabling already installed would want to use that.    Apr 2017 update:    Every few weeks my 2009 iMac goes off Wifi with these eeros and will not reconnect and requires a reboot.  The other Apple products seem OK, so I don't know what is going on, and I haven't had a chance to get support to intervene on this yet.  At this point, that is my only gripe about these. ",
Entrope,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"We have a fairly large home and property where we need wifi in almost every section of the property for everything from Apple TV's to security cameras.  We have literally spent thousands of dollars attempting to make the wifi signal be reliable within our home, on the grounds of the property, and within other structures on the property. Some of the solutions worked (albeit usually temporarily), but the solutions that did work required the services of our computer technician to install and/or fix. That being said, that has grown increasingly expensive as a simple reboot of the system if anything did go hay wire generated a bill from the IT company. In a last ditch effort before hard wiring the entire property, we tried eero.  In less than 30 minutes, we had the entire property up and running on eero WITHOUT THE NEED FOR THE IT COMPANY!!!  We hardly ever write a review, but I felt compelled to do so for this product.  I can't say enough about the quality and SIMPLICITY of the product!!!  Buy it.  You won't regret the decision!!!!! ",
"Andy B.","February 8, 2017 ",5.0,"This system has worked incredibly well.  It is certainly not cheap, but it seems to be a case of getting what you pay for: excellent performance and fast set up.  Setup relies on a simple iPhone app and was super simple.  The network performance has been flawless and fast.  However, two important notes: (1) it takes a couple days for the network to optimize itself, so be patient - mine was pretty fast out of the box, but a friend's eero network (in a taller house) improved by nearly 3X over the course of about 48 hours (2) you have to do the latest software updates for the best performance. Below are the performance numbers for my old Airport Extreme, followed by the eero without a patch and then the eero with the patch. ",
"Occasional Reviewer","August 21, 2016 ",5.0,"I'm am geek without all the knowledge so keep that in mind when you read this review.  I have tried everything to get wifi to reach all part of my house.  My office is in the back so the router would not put off enough signal at 50 feet away to work my iPhone.. randomly came across this product thanks to the geek squad installing my new microwave.. free advice I'll take it.    Do not let the price scare you! The upstairs portion of my house is almost 2000sq feet with a fireplace and wall in the middle. I have 4 eero's set up in 4 part of the house and I absolutely love it    Set up is a breeze with the app and it even tells you if the location you picked will not work. Just to give you an idea on my wifi speed, I was getting 49mb in my car. About 50 feet from the box in the kitchen.  79mbs in certain parts of the house and 30 mb in the basement.    I run kodi on hd, Apple TV, the wife finally loves me again now that she can use her laptop in the living room.    There are cheaper options but I've learned my lesson. Definitely worth the buy ",
"carlton marshall","December 26, 2016 ",5.0,"review 12/17/16    Eero with three access points function at least as well as three separate access points (any brand) on the same SSID.  I wired all three of my eero units to wifi in order to handle the &#34;backhaul&#34;.    The fundamental problem with this setup:  Apple devices such as iphone 6s and the late 2016 macbook pro with touch bar (absolute latest devices available from Apple) do not handoff from one eero to another without dropping connection.  The handoff from access point to access point varies from 1 to 10 seconds depending who knows what.  You WILL DROP VOIP CALLS or IPHONE/IMUSIC/AIRPLAY streams during handoff.  It is NOT ANY different in performance compared to having multiple airport express access points.    If all you want is more broad coverage of wifi, any number of solutions will be feasible. If you want SEAMLESS transition, I would say NOTHING exists that is perfect at this time.    Apple has no way of knowing how many access points you have and it clearly does not scan or actively trade access points until your bandwidth drops into oblivion and you lose connection first.  Even then, the handoff is way too slow to reconnect.    It is possible in addition that the foam insulation in my house is causing more radio reflections and slowing things down even further.  But that makes my point even more important:  the challenging house is where you would want an eero to work... and that's exactly where it won't.    People seem to have reported poor results in other wifi discussions with apple products in terms of handoff between access points.  Unless devices are actively scanning with a second wifi antenna and pre-connecting, you won't get the desired results.  Another option might be if a device was connected to two signals at once.    I am going back to me centrally placed asus router so that I can do Iphone over wifi with AT&T since my cell reception sucks in my house.  I lose some phone coverage at certain corners of my house, but this is something I am going to have to live with.  I suspect nothing important will change in my house until wifi technology moves towards a true mesh network at some point.    SEAMLESS HANDOFF is what we are looking for Eero and Apple.  Eero is falsely advertising until this can be done.  Eero bears responsibility for not warning the average user that their product won't work with all clients.  I am clearly not the average user and so I was able to figure out that this is not going to work no matter how much I screw around with it.    I gave this 3 stars but I should have been much more harsh for wasting half my day on this nonsense.  I am curious how many people who installed an Eero are predominantly just on one AP and therefore are reporting good results.  If someone has any further theories, I am willing to hear them... ",
Kishore,"November 4, 2016 ",5.0,"We tired many different routers, including adding access points or signal boosters and nothing worked. The router is on the 3rd floor of our home. The wi-fi was okay up there but on the second floor where the Xbox and iPads are, it was terrible.    It took 10 minutes to install three eero units, and we were getting 150mbps almost immediately. Throughout the entire house.    The reason I give this review only 4 stars instead of 5, is that it took about 48 hours for the speeds to remain constantly high. We'd go from 150mbps to &#60; 5.  Support suggest constantly power cycling the eero units and my modem, which does help, but I shouldn't have to power cycle so often.    It's been a week and speeds are consistently high. The eero units upgrade their firmware in about 24 hours. Most of the issues you will read on here and other forums are related to the very early release before they updated the firmware.    It's expensive, but it was worth every penny.  Could we have probably found a cheaper and simpler solution, possibly but these are good looking and elegant and just work.  Reminds me of Apple in a way.    I've attached an image from fast.com of our wireless speeds. We pay for 150mbps from Xfinity and as you can see our wireless is faster than what we're even paying for. ",
"Jack Marchetti","December 17, 2016 ",3.0,"Let me start by saying that I normally don't write many reviews on products, nor do I put my name on them.  However, this is one that I will make an exception for.  I absolutely love the eero systems that I have bought.  And just so you know, I went with the 2 pack to get started.    You really can't ask for a more simple setup process.  Simply plug your first eero device into your modem/router and then follow the steps on your mobile app.  Adding a second eero was even easier.    In case this helps you with your decision to by, the current house these 2 devices are covering is around 2500 sq. ft and 2 story.  I have one eero upstairs in the media room and one downstairs in the living room.  These 2 cover the entire house with no issue and I can even get coverage out into the front and back yards.    I've been in IT for many years and appreciate being able to just set eero up and then forget about it.  Occasionally I'll receive an email saying my devices have been updated to improve security and performance.  Thank you for that!  Last thing I want after working a full day is to come home and have to worry about updating firmware on my wireless devices.    If you are a huge techie and want every single wireless or network option/feature to play around with then this may not be the device you are looking for.  But if you are looking for a stable, quality product that does everything it needs and then some, this is a great purchase!  A bit pricey yes, but well worth it in the long run! ",
"Shawn H.","June 15, 2016 ",4.0,"I purchased the 3 pack in July 2016 and I've had absolutely no issues with them whatsoever. I cannot say the same for the&nbsp;NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Dual Band Wi-Fi Gigabit Router (R7000) with Open Source Support. Compatible with Amazon Echo/Alexa&nbsp;that I purchased in January 2015 and its companion, the&nbsp;NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Desktop WiFi Range Extender (EX7000-100NAS)&nbsp;purchased in June 2015. At the time, I thought I was out of my mind spending $400 on the eero Home WiFi System (it would've been $500 at the time, but Amazon offered a promo of $100 off), especially considering the amount of money I had already spent on the Netgear Nighthawk equipment. While the Netgear equipment provided fast throughput, I clearly decided 6 mos after purchasing the router that I needed an extender. Also, by 2016 I was experiencing dropouts all the time to the point that I routinely had to cycle the router nearly every day. I could not for the life of me figure out what was going on w/the Netgear router. I was so frustrated that I simply had to try the eero Home WiFi System. To date, I've had no dropouts; no need to cycle power - the eero simply works and is frustration free. I have one in second floor my home office, one in my upstairs bedroom, and the third in a cabinet (supposedly a no-no re: reception) that house my gaming systems, DVR, etc. There are currently 23 connected devices including 2 desktops, 3 laptops, 2 tablets, 3 cell phones, 4 Sonos speakers, 3 streaming devices, 3 Arlo cameras, 1 Ring doorbell camera (which prompted the purchase of the Netgear Extender), multiple Hue lightbulbs, etc. etc. When needed and in use, everything that is on my network works and works well. I never experience buffering issues when streaming music or TV. Web pages load quickly and multiplayer gaming is lag free. I also have a strong signal in my front and back yard! (I'm using this with Comcast Blast Plus!I also like that they are low profile and simply elegant compared to the beastly size and unattractive look of my old Netgear equipment (currently housed in a drawer until I figure out what to do with them). The only draw back I can think of is that there is only one ethernet port. However, that problem is easily solved through the purchase of an ethernet switching device such as the one I purchased for roughly $10:&nbsp;NETGEAR 5-Port Fast Ethernet 10/100Mbps Switch (FS205).  Oh - and I initially had an issue in which I had a problem getting eero to work with my employer's VPN and customer support was quick, friendly and solved the problem. That was the one and only problem I've had with these. All in all, If you're looking for a hassle free solution to router/WiFi issues and you don't mind that you're not going to be able to tweak various settings like QOS, then the eero system is the way to go. Frankly, I don't miss looking at or tweaking the various settings on Netgear's software - I really don't have a need to with the eero since it works as expected. Which is to say that the eero Home Wifi System exceeded my expectations and was definitely worth the expense in order to achieve hassle free WiFi throughout my home (including the yard, attic and basement). Highly, highly recommended. ",

"J. Mangan","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"My long time network configuration - an Apple Time Capsule with Apple Airport Expresses as network extenders finally had to be &#34;retired&#34; because network performance was becoming inconsistent. It served me well for years; however, I could never get a solid wifi signal throughout my home, nor the performance throughput I was paying for with Comcast.    Got tired of my wife complaining about as the signal degradation the past year. Watch the Eero video on their web site.....it is spot on. I was doing everything the guy in the video was doing. I purchased Eero's products, because I didn't want to deal with a non-consumer friendly, poorly designed, and less than stellar performance networking solution. I did look at competing mesh networking products, but chose Eero for the favorable customer experience.    Set-up was as easy as everyone has written about. Just plug the devices in as instructed, and everything was recognized by their iOS app. Took a few minutes on my devices were all online. I kept my same network name as my old one and the same network password, so all my devices were recognized.    Only task I had to do was update the firmware. The firmware update done via their iOS app and the network worked perfectly after upgrade. The only extra thing I did was assign a unique name to every device on my network. I did not care if I didn't have all the configuration parameters like I did with my Apple set-up, because I never used the overly technical settings to begin with.    I now have 17 unique devices on the network with no reported problems. This includes one Nest thermostat, three Nest smoke alarms, one Apple time machine network drive, two iPads, two iPhones, one Apple TV, one Amazon Fire stick, one Apple iMac, one Apple MacBook Pro, and a five others for good measure. No lags, no offline conditions, etc. It appears to just work.    Observations:    - Easy to install and set-up.  - Eero constantly improving their software and features. Very easy to see how committed they are to making this a best in class product.  - iOS app is straight forward. No bloated app design. They keep it simple and clean. No way to get lost in it.  - App allows you to turn off the device indicator light.  - Covers my two-story home with consistent high throughput wifi coverage.  - Responsive customer service. When one of my devices failed after 48 hrs. I called Eero and got a live person who spoke English...they shipped a replacement device immediately. All I had to do was return the defective device in the package with pre-paid shipping label. Easy.  - Easy online Help information. Again, information is easy to find/search for, well composed, and offers easy to follow instructions.  - Delivers a consistent and available connection across my 2200 foot two story home. Check out the awesome performance I am getting in the picture I posted.    Misc.    - One satellite device failed after 48 hrs, but Eero replaced it immediately (thank you Eero).  - When checking the wifi performance via the iOS app, it is not clear how the network speed results are determined. It would be nice know which device it is testing the network throughput from. When I test with Speedtest.net, I get a totally different network performance number. I don't know why. Maybe another user can enlighten me. I did notice when I check the network speed on multiple devices with the Eero app....they all activate. Interesting, no issue on that, just my curiosity why?  - I wish the devices were smaller in footprint like the Apple Airport Express.    No showstoppers, a positive customer experience, and my wife is happy with her husband again.    Thank you Eero, keep up the good work! ",
"K. Kwan","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I have purchased the 2 units packaging but since most reviews are posted here so I am posting mine here as well. I got this two days ago and it worked great right off the bat, I got pretty good signal in one area my old router was given me problem.  Anyway that did not last, end of day one my wireless printer was not working and somehow I could not even join the network.  I tried restarting the printer several times but the printer just could not find the network at all.  So i tried rebooting my eeros and at the end deleted my entire network and started over over again.  The printer was working but my second eero just refused to be connected to the main one even it was sitting next to each other.  It kept telling me my second eero was out of range in bad placement while they were next to each other.  I tried to restart, and also completely reset the eero by using the reset button at the back, still not working.  At the end i had to switch the main and the slave units and it finally worked again.  Good thing just don't last, the next day i saw my network just disappeared for like a minute and kicked all items off.  At the end I just returned them as I don't think this product is ready for prime time.  Also if you notice there are a lot of positive 5 starts reviews by &#34;NON verified&#34; buyers so you know they are trying to bump up the ratings.  Just my opinion. ",
"eero Support","March 27, 2017 ",5.0,"This new technology is as good an improvement as I could have hoped for.  I have Comcast high speed internet, very fast and I use the latest Apple Airport Extreme for my router.  We have a large house (3700 square feet) and we have many bad spots with poor speed.  For example my Apple Macbook Air in our kitchen sometimes is as slow as 2-5 mbps, while if I put the laptop next to the router (which is upstairs) I can get 100-175 mbps.  I also noticed that Apple has announced they are getting out of the router business--that suggested to me they realize their technology isn't keeping up and perhaps they don't want to invest in this area.  So I bought the 3-pack Eero and set it up, total time probably 20-25 minutes.  I chose to sort of triangulate my house, two units upstairs at each end of the house and one in the kitchen.  Despite the fact that Eero says it may take 24 hours to get up to full speed I am getting 125-175 mbps everywhere---yeehaa!  My Facetime to London was better and my Ring doorbell videos are much better.  One tip for setting it up:  Eero said to plug in the first unit and the modem simultaneously,  but the Comcast modem takes about a minute to connect so the Eero unit seemed to be struggling to connect.  I would suggest plugging in the modem first, let it show all the lights up and running, then plug in the Eero.  One other thought; some online reviews complain about the somewhat higher price of the Eero vs. Google wifi versus Orbi for example.  I think this is a mistake.  Having the best and fastest wifi in one's home is about as important as anything you have running in your house.  I am willing to pay extra for the best solution which this clearly is. ",
"David S.","April 22, 2016 ",3.0,"My family's home is an older home, with thick interior walls made of brick (not just brick faÃ§ade). What's more, it's two stories and it's long. Ever since Wi-Fi came into popular use, we had a single router in a closet at one end of the house â€”Â an old Linksys. Of course, that meant that barely one half of the house had Wi-Fi, but this was still in the days of Wi-Fi extension cards. About five years ago, I scrapped that router and put an Apple Airport Extreme in its place, with an Airport Express in the opposite corner of the house. This worked a lot better, but there was a dreaded dead zone in the middle, which became apparent as we walked through it with our smartphones and our current task slowed to a halt. As soon as I found out about this system, which claims to handle good signal propagation for you (provided you place them at a certain interval with line-of-sight), I was very excited. I bought five for the house, and dotted them throughout, favoring the rooms of family members who had chronically complained about terrible signals and speeds for years. After giving the system a few days to &#34;self-configure,&#34; (eero's secret sauce), everyone had consistently good speeds and reliable signal in every corner of the house, on every device. What's more, we get the speed we're actually paying for with our ISP. Suffice to say I love this product. I don't think the price is that bad when I compare a single unit to an Airport Express, similar in price and size â€” the eero does more than the Express anyways. One caveat to anyone looking at these is the speed drop that you may experience when your device is connected to an eero node that is several hops away from a wired connection. eero has reduced this problem compared to standard repeaters, but the fact is that you lose speed with each hop â€”Â my solution was to hardwire a few eero nodes using Power over Ethernet devices to get ethernet in the middle of the house.

"Paul Herz","February 19, 2017 ",5.0,"THIS. IS. THE. VERY. BEST. period.    I could just stop there. We've had trouble with internet FOREVER. I can't remember a time when we didn't have to literally restart our modem multiple times a day. (Old house - plaster walls, multiple levels etc.)  I had tried everything.  Multiple power lines.  Multiple routers and wifi and extenders, etc.  Then I read about mesh networks.  And did my research.  Wow.  My life has changed !! Eero is amazing.  Easy to set up.  Easy to use.  Easy to monitor when set up.  AND THE BEST PART ... I HAVE NOT RESTARTED MY MODEM SINCE WE GOT IT OVER A MONTH AGO.  And the signal strength is POWERFUL...and reaches all of our trouble spots without any trouble.  LOVE IT. THANK YOU EERO. THANK YOU THANK YOU !!! ",
sp,"September 30, 2016 ",5.0,"OK, check my past reviews and see no raving about anything. This was phenomenal!  Best product ever!  No instructions, uses a IOS app (I'm sure there is an android equivalent).  If I had a normal situation, I would have been up and running in 5 minutes. My situation was challenging, because I get a very bad/no service signal on my cell phone without my ATT microcell which comes over the wifi network. So when I tried to do the install which begins with the router off, I would constantly loses cell service which halted the install. I was halted hundreds of times but eero kept remembering where I was and eventually completed the install. Now I have faster wifi then ever before and the same throughout my 2200 sq ft house. I have 3 eeros and I might have been OK with just 2 units. Love this thing!  I have watched this product for a year wondering if it was worth the price, and it is- and more so with the $100 price reduction. I am a FAN! ",
"Stuart Siegel","January 3, 2017 ",5.0,"My house is 2400 sqft. rambler that is &#34;L&#34; shaped. The Internet connection enters the house all the way at one end.    I have tried powerline adapters, wifi extenders and high end wifi routers. Short of paying $750.00 - $1000.00 to wire the house with Cat6 this is the easiest solution.    I started with the 3pack. They were very easy to setup. The first week I had some connectivity issues so I purchased a 4th. I'm guessing the issues had to do more with the fact of where I wanted to place the units. I probably could have had put them in other less than desirable locations and I would have been fine.    I noticed that over time signal got more reliable perhaps the MIMO antenna learns where to concentrate its power in each unit.    The eero creates a &#34;mesh&#34; network so your devices will seemlessly switch between units.    Another excellent feature is that each eero has two radios inside one for sending and one for receiving data. This means unlike traditional extenders your data speed aren't cut in half with each additional unit.    I would recommend them for anyone who wants a reliable wifi network in their house. ",
Longliner,"November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I struggle w/ 4 or 5 stars. I am a engineer and my network maybe was a bit different then the intended audience and I want to be fair if this is at all the cause for my challenges. That being said, if you are looking for a simple to use wifi mesh that will cover a large square footage home, this is a great product and dead simple to install. My only complaint is after initial install the app stated that &#34;Everything Looks Good&#34; although I was unable to pass traffic from any wireless connected device. It was not until I went into &#34;Help--&#62;My Internet is slow--&#62;Run Health Check&#34; that there was a sign of an issue. I just found this very misleading and as a technical person I did know howto logically troubleshoot but would my friend or family member or would this be a call to the guy who recommends it, me ? The other issue was an undocumented feature that suddenly appeared after a software update that now my wireless devices can not converse with my wired devices, this presents an issue because my wired device is my desktop/media server and now none of my devices can do app hand off in spotify to my desktop.  Another EXCELLENT win for this solution is support, I spoke with a girl who was extremely knowledgeable and courteous and would say this is the best consumer network device support in the industry right now.  Please keep in mind, if you have a very simple cable modem and wireless setup, you may have no issues but I have a cable modem, router, switch, wired VoIP, wired desktops, and now Eero for wifi and there are some challenges.

RoadRage,"April 21, 2016 ",5.0,"Setting this up was really easy and is providing great coverage.  At first I was put back a bit because I was used to having a 2.4g and 5g network using my old system where zeros just creates one and doesn't really specify what its doing.  After using it for a couple of weeks, I couldn't care less as I have the bandwidth I need in the spot I needed it in.  I also set up the guest network which works perfectly.  This is not cheap, but so far, I feel like it was money well spent.  No more networking concerns.    Because I bought a 110 year old house, there is no cabling option so everything has to work on wifi.  But because of the walls being plaster and brick, my old system with extenders just wasn't working.  Now I have almost 20 devices connected (from the video doorbell, to all the computers, TV, sound system, lights, etc) without any issue.  I have an internet service that provides 50Mbps download speed.  Next to the connected router i am getting consistent speed of 57Mbps using netflix's speed test.  At the other end of the house where I have a TV connected with an Apple TV, the test is producing 27-29Mbps which is plenty for streaming.  There are areas that drop below that speed, but so far nothing that is terrible.  I may end up buying additional routers to help in some of the weaker areas, but for now, I cannot be happier with the system. ",
"Jose Porro","April 14, 2017 ",4.0,"Before eero, one of our computers would disconnect from WiFi frequently and we had occasional buffering issues with Netflix and Amazon Video on our smart televisions. I should also mention that In the last couple of years we've added two tablets, an Amazon Echo, an Echo Dot, a device that monitors our rooftop solar panels, a Joule sous vide, a Hue bridge and several WiFi-enabled LED light bulbs. Projecting that there will be more smart devices to come in the near future, we needed to act. After researching routers and router extenders, it was decided that the eero system would be our best option. A hefty price break sealed the deal and we purchased a three pack. Since the eero system was put into service to blanket the house, we've had no further connectivity issues. Installation was incredibly simple--all devices connected easily and they work as they are supposed to. As non-techies, automatic updates are a big plus; there is no wondering if our router is up-to-date (if it wasn't, we wouldn't have known how to update it anyway). Unlike our previous routers, eero's appearance is sleek and unobtrusive. We like our eero system so much that we will be ordering another one or two for our vacation home shortly. ",

"Peter Jensen","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I loved the small footprint of the devices, and the simplicity of the management. However I ended up returning them after a prolonged troubleshooting with the otherwise excellent customer service. I had multiple periodic but recurring issues with the eero. First and foremost my Sonos systems really did not like the eero system - my players would drop off the network randomly and there would be much skipping and stopping of music play. Occasionally my streaming devices would lose connectivity too, but the frequency was much less so than with Sonos. The eero troubleshooting seemed fixated on my netgear gigabit switch which they thought eero did work well with. Since I couldn't detach my wired network for extended periods the troubleshooting stalled and I decided to return the eero. As contrast - I replaced it with the Orbi mesh network router. All of my Sonos devices have worked perfectly since, I have had no issues with my streaming devices. Connectivity and speed seem really good and my wired switch is operating as expected so my recommendation would be to go with Orbi (which is also the mesh &#34;pick&#34; by the Wirecutter blog). ",
SuperJon,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I installed this system in my small office approximately three weeks ago.  We have 15 devices connecting to them wirelessly.  So far, they have worked flawlessly.  They are incredibly easy to setup using the free mobile app.  They offer superb bandwidth via WiFi and seem to really do well at not dropping connections.  I have absolutely zero complaints so far.  As well, the range for each module is very impressive.  We can easily go 100 ft in any direction and have excellent signal.    My one favorite feature about the EERO system compared to several other similar systems I was looking at, is that each module has two ethernet ports on that back that allow two things to be available: 1) I can hardwire devices at my office(that do not have wifi option) to these via ethernet cable, and 2) I can hardwire the modules via ethernet back to the main unit serving as the router which provides a more robust setup with a much less chance of dropouts.    I will definitely recommend these to other for their small offices and homes. These are fantastic! ",
wsconn1,"April 19, 2017 ",2.0,"These appear to have resolved a problem of spotty wifi around my house.  Set up was very easy.  The only problem I had was that after getting these set up, they auto-updated the software and the app got frozen -- although the eeros themselves were working.  I finally deleted the app and reinstalled it and everything has been good since then.  I am surprised that I do get an occasional message when trying to use my iPad and my Apple TV, both in the same room as an eero, telling me that the signal is too weak.  There is a clear line of sight between all three devices and the Apple TV is close to the eero but a bit lower.  I'll experiment a bit with placement and assume this will be resolved.  Regardless, I would recommend these because of the design, ease of set up and blanket coverage elsewhere in my house. ",
"Troy W.","January 18, 2017 ",5.0,"Beautifully simple and effective. I'll admit the price tag gave me pause initially, but I was desperate for a solution to inconsistent WiFi throughout my home and constantly buffering Netflix and Hulu. We don't have cable, so streaming quality is important to us. The system came highly recommended by a friend who had similar issues, so I gave it a try. I had tried various routers and range extenders (wired and wireless) in the past, none of which seemed to work as advertised.    First, and most importantly, the system works. It created a single, continuous network throughout my home. I don't have to switch networks when I'm on the patio or upstairs and my online and streaming experience is now what I expect it to be. We have phones, tablets, computers, printers, Sonos, Roku, etc. all connected to a single network and it works awesome.    The packaging was clean and elegant. The setup could not have been more simple. The iPhone app is incredible. It allows me to monitor the network, see which devices are connected, test download and upload speeds, turn on/off guest access, and more.    After several weeks, one of the units wasn't connecting to the network, so I called their support number. It was late on a Sunday evening and I was connected with a polite, English-speaking representative. He tried a few things and in a matter of minutes decided to express ship a new replacement unit instead of keeping me on the line. It was easily one of the best call center experiences I've had.    Absolutely no buyer's remorse here. I'm a fan! ",
Michael,"April 9, 2017 ",4.0,"Fantastic.  I live in a 4 story house and was using a patchwork quilt of wireless routers, but still had dead zones everywhere, dropped signals and all sorts of problems.  I set up the eero system using 1 eero for each floor and it works perfectly.  The eeros are each plugged in to an ethernet jack.  However, I had to configure the system in a specific way that may be of interest to some of you.  The house is wired with ethernet jacks on each floor; they all emanate from the basement where the signal comes in from Time Warner Cable.  I had to get 4 eeros, and put one of them upstream of the switch that channels the signals to the different rooms.  Furthermore, I had to get a new switch since the very old linksys device I used to be using as a switch would not stop handing out its own IP addresses no matter how many times I changed its parameters telling it not to!  The eeros did not like that and got confused.  Once I bought a simple new 16-port switch, everything worked perfectly.    There's another product out there called Ubiquiti Unifi wireless access points, but apparently you have to be a tech genius to set it up and the tech support is non-existent.  Avoid at all costs. ",
"Gilbert L. Standen","January 26, 2017 ",5.0,"I was 100% totally satisfied with the 2-pack eero.  First of all I use a Blackberry OS 10 device (Blackberry Passport) and the first step is to download their eero app which as a Blackberry OS10 user you can download the android app from Google Play Store on Blackberry OS10 (see Cobalt guide at crackberry.com on how to install Google Play Store on Blackberry OS10 devices) or you can download it from 1MobileMarket but oddly even though I bought this product from Amazon, the eero app was not available in the Amazon App Store.  Anyway, the eero app RUNS PEFECTCLY on Blackberry OS10 so I'm sure it will run perfectly on true Android phones as well, and they also have eero for Apple iPhone.  As far as installation and setup it was the easiest sweetest wifi setup ever.  You first install the eero app and then the app takes you through the install and setup of the equipment.  My existing setup was a Cisco DPC3208 Cable Modem on the Charter Cable network and a Netgear WNDR3400v3 for providing wired connections plugged into the ethernet port of the Cisco Modem.  The eero devices have two ports.  You can use one port for the connection to the modem and the other port (they are equivalent ports btw) you can use to plug in a switch for wired connections.  I added the switch last after everything was completely setup by plugging it into the extra port on the gateway eero attached to the modem.  So the setup is done from the eero app. All the steps went totally smoothly with no problems - sweet.  There was one page though after the initial connection and plug-in of everything where it said something like &#34;network not detected plug in your router&#34; but I just pressed next to the next step and it detected the network immediately so not sure what was up with that page.  All the rest of the steps were totally smooth.  You take the next eero and position it somewhere in the house where you need wifi and then once all the eero have been added to the network (which is ALL done by the eero APP - it tells you what is happening and what if anything you need to do next).  Then the app prompts if you want to download updates to the eero software and I tapped yes and that took about 10 minutes or so and went through with no problems at all.  Now one cool thing is that this eero network was TOTALLY ADDITIVE.  The existing Cisco Modem has a wireless network built-in too, and that is still working and available, but now the eero network is added too so there are two networks to choose from, with the eero being the extendable network (I could buy another eero unit and add it to the network if necessary).  I give this product 5 stars and would give it 6 stars if I could!  It's a really easy to deploy great product that works and just adds on to your existing network at least for my network. ",
"Mary Ventura","May 12, 2016 ",5.0,"5 years ago I moved from a 1300 sqft home to a 3300 sqft home. And for 5 years I have struggled to get consistent, high quality coverage throughout our space.  I have spent at least $300 in modems, wifi routers and extenders, not to mention hours...sometimes the better part of an entire day setting a network up, only to find equipment isn't compatible and I need to start over.    We had made due with one extender that needed to be reset about 3x week.    When I heard about Eero I was excited, maybe my evenings of crawling out of bed in the middle of a show to reset the signal were over.    They ARE!!! Eero is as amazing as I heard it was!!!  I set the whole system (I bought the 3 pack) up in about 30 minutes- that includes time spent reading the instructions.  We have a network, a personalized password that makes sense...not the weird random series of characters everyone hates but beginners don't know how to change...    (For reference, I don't consider myself a beginner in this work, I am tech savvy and able to work my way through networks and systems, however setting up multiple different extenders on one network proved difficult for me. We had personalized network password before eero).    I can control everything from my phone...not much to control but I can see how many devices are on the signal, turn the device lights off/on, and see the speeds I'm uploading/downloading at.    Also, the diagram says to centralize all the hubs, but due to the odd layout of our house it just wasn't possible. Even without the centralizing we have full signal in every room, including our garages and backyard. We basically cover 1/2 an acre!!! It's not full strength all over, but it's covers the space!    We have been up and running solidly for a month now...no issues!    The CONS-  *I know I should list $$$, however I think the quality of the devices compared to the cost I've spent trying to get what this delivers is fairly comparable...I'd much rather spend the money once on one functional product than little bits at a time trying to make something work that just doesn't ever get there.  *Ethernet outlets are limited. This isn't a huge deal, but our printer is outdated and we needed a way to connect it. Updating printer now. ",
Doug,"April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"I installed this eero (pack of 3 unit) combo mesh system as soon as I received them via Amazon Prime. Because I was also installing Comcast 150mbps Internet service the next day and until installed , I continued to use the slower att DSL solution that day with these new units with a WiFi ssid already configured to my own desired WiFi IDs/passwords. Then using these eero units, I just power cycled then reconnected to the nice/simple Netgear cable modem(CM600-100NAS) I ordered at the same time as I ordered these eero units, just changing a the 10BaseT cable from the att gateway to new Comcast modem when Comcast lit up the service the following day at my house.    With the Comcast service, I wanted better WiFi coverage than supplied by any Comcast gateway integrated router. Plus I did-not want to lease any cablemodem/routher wifi equipment from Comcast (ROI of providing myself less than a year).  It seemed like the eero was a possible clean solution, providing better wifi coverage than available using the gateways provided under lease from my ISP (Comcast).    The eero packaging was very clean and well marked for &#34;how to install&#34; and the iPhone application to do the actual set-up was surprisingly very simple to use. After installing the initial set of eero's with full success, I decided to get fancy as I wanted to get &#34;5 bars of coverage&#34; everywhere in a rather large home footprint along with a separate detached storage area/building, so I ordered a 2nd set of eeros to expand my newly installed wifi mesh network.    After expanding my eero mesh network, all went well again except some results with speedtest.net were more inconsistant than before my eero added expansion. To understand what was going on I rang a call into the eero support line (link to call right on the Iphone eero application(and iphone application easy to use, configure ssids/passwords, adding a guest network, etc). This support call I made is where eero really shined because:  A gentleman named Dave answered the phone at the eeros support number. Dave was not just a phone agent answering and reading from a script. Rather, he was obviously a well educated/experienced IT networking professional with good customer support skills. After reviewing my home network configuration and my concerns, Dave ran a performance test between my eeros and while doing so answered my many rather detailed questions (I'm &#34;retired from IT&#34;) with accuracy which I really appreciated. The quality of Dave's efforts working with me by phone was superb. It turns out I had two erros closer than need be, and in the end Dave's time with me over the phone assisted me in tuning this new eeros mesh network perfectly.  It's been flawless since.    In addition, as a side benefit of the eero design: each remote eero in the mesh network provides a spare 10BaseT port that can be used to connect a hardwired device (TV, PC, switch, etc) if desired, or be used, if a hardwired network is available, as a &#34;backhaul&#34; to the erro that is plugged into the cable modem.    So bottom line, eero provided me a perfect homerun solution.    Doug ",
"Peter J. Riley","January 13, 2017 ",5.0,"Have had these now for about 6 months, they work very well.  Have never had to reboot or fuss with them at all.

I have 4 in my house and the speed does vary from room to room, the fastest being the box closest to the Comcast modem source, but every room has sufficient speeds to power anything you want to do.  Finally, I am not sure if I have EVER encountered any technology as easy to set up as eero, completely amazing, real idiots deluxe, it was up and running in minutes and has never stopped.

"F. Huang","May 24, 2016 ",5.0,"I was extremely skeptical of this solution as I consider myself (and take pride in) as being someone who is sophisticated in the ways of home networking. My wife and I moved to a new home and for the past 2 years have been struggling with trying to find a way to get predictable and reliable WiFi around the house.    Our home has two levels and most of the time we saw extreme degradation in bandwidth once we were about 25-30 feet away from the router (Netgear AC1750). There must be some kind of building material that hampers the signal and I was hopeful that the AC1750, with it's 3 large antennas, would help solve this, but it was no good.  We resorted to using the AC1750, two Airport Extremes (Gen 2) using powerline ethernet to get full coverage of the house.  However, I consistently noted that my devices had a hard time switching to the strongest access point.    Enter the Eero. A friend swore by it and reluctantly I plunked down $500 and thought that this solution would be going back to the manufacturer as yet another wifi solution that would fail to deliver. I was totally wrong. Installation was a breeze with the iPhone app and within 10 min, the system was up and running. I ran a few speed tests in the dead spots of the home and my wife was asking me why I was screaming. Performance at the edges of the house was the same as it was with direct line of sight to the primary router.  I also tested watching video as I passed from one end of the house to the other and you can see the Eero system intelligently and seamlessly switching access points once WiFi signal degrades.    My only regret here is that I had waited so long to buy the product. Websites all have a faster load time and I was able to downgrade our service plan from Comcast from 100Mbps to 25Mbps since we primarily surf the web and watch Netflix. In an unexpected way, the Eero will actually pay for itself over time as we don't have to pay for higher bandwidth coming into our pipe.

"Troy W.","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Beautifully simple and effective. I'll admit the price tag gave me pause initially, but I was desperate for a solution to inconsistent WiFi throughout my home and constantly buffering Netflix and Hulu. We don't have cable, so streaming quality is important to us. The system came highly recommended by a friend who had similar issues, so I gave it a try. I had tried various routers and range extenders (wired and wireless) in the past, none of which seemed to work as advertised.    First, and most importantly, the system works. It created a single, continuous network throughout my home. I don't have to switch networks when I'm on the patio or upstairs and my online and streaming experience is now what I expect it to be. We have phones, tablets, computers, printers, Sonos, Roku, etc. all connected to a single network and it works awesome.    The packaging was clean and elegant. The setup could not have been more simple. The iPhone app is incredible. It allows me to monitor the network, see which devices are connected, test download and upload speeds, turn on/off guest access, and more.    After several weeks, one of the units wasn't connecting to the network, so I called their support number. It was late on a Sunday evening and I was connected with a polite, English-speaking representative. He tried a few things and in a matter of minutes decided to express ship a new replacement unit instead of keeping me on the line. It was easily one of the best call center experiences I've had.    Absolutely no buyer's remorse here. I'm a fan! ",
"Melissa B","November 29, 2016 ",5.0,"We got this a few months ago and have had no issues with it.  And now that they have added Family Profiles, it's even better.  After years of incomplete Wi-Fi coverage of our 2 story home (2600 sqft), we finally have coverage everywhere - including the back yard.  It was very easy to set up, and all our devices work with it (laptops, Apple TV, Roku, iTouch, iphone, Nintendo DS, Wii U, etc).  The new family profiles let me manage our kids' devices individually, automatically cutting them off an hour before bedtime and letting me pause their access at any time.  I can also see all devices on the network and manage them individually.  The app is easy to use and I can use it anywhere.  I use the guest network for babysitters and other guests and can turn if off and/or change the password easily thru the app.  Note - Only issue we did have was the Apple TV dropping access, but we used a network cable to connect it directly into one of the Eero units and have had no more dropping.

"david renton","January 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Having spent money over and over on various wifi extenders, it was a joy to be able to install this product quite easily and for it to work really well, just about instantaneously.  The concept is elegant, you add more if you need to, and I believe they all take care of the housekeeping between them, handing you from one to the other as you move around your house.  No more waiting while my device hunts for a different supplier of the same wifi signal while it switches from the main wifi to the range extender.  No more 'the server timed out because your device appears to be offline' messages. I would always think &#34;I didn't stop paying for that internet - it's still there, and I shouldn't have to coax a device into communicating with my router&#34;.  Also the design is pleasing, the squared-off white hockey puck doesn't look like much wherever it's placed, and the cord from the bit that plugs into the wall outlet is long enough that you have placement options.  It's also cool that you can programmatically turn off the little white 'on' light ",
"Gilbert L. Standen","June 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I was 100% totally satisfied with the 2-pack eero.  First of all I use a Blackberry OS 10 device (Blackberry Passport) and the first step is to download their eero app which as a Blackberry OS10 user you can download the android app from Google Play Store on Blackberry OS10 (see Cobalt guide at crackberry.com on how to install Google Play Store on Blackberry OS10 devices) or you can download it from 1MobileMarket but oddly even though I bought this product from Amazon, the eero app was not available in the Amazon App Store.  Anyway, the eero app RUNS PEFECTCLY on Blackberry OS10 so I'm sure it will run perfectly on true Android phones as well, and they also have eero for Apple iPhone.  As far as installation and setup it was the easiest sweetest wifi setup ever.  You first install the eero app and then the app takes you through the install and setup of the equipment.  My existing setup was a Cisco DPC3208 Cable Modem on the Charter Cable network and a Netgear WNDR3400v3 for providing wired connections plugged into the ethernet port of the Cisco Modem.  The eero devices have two ports.  You can use one port for the connection to the modem and the other port (they are equivalent ports btw) you can use to plug in a switch for wired connections.  I added the switch last after everything was completely setup by plugging it into the extra port on the gateway eero attached to the modem.  So the setup is done from the eero app. All the steps went totally smoothly with no problems - sweet.  There was one page though after the initial connection and plug-in of everything where it said something like &#34;network not detected plug in your router&#34; but I just pressed next to the next step and it detected the network immediately so not sure what was up with that page.  All the rest of the steps were totally smooth.  You take the next eero and position it somewhere in the house where you need wifi and then once all the eero have been added to the network (which is ALL done by the eero APP - it tells you what is happening and what if anything you need to do next).  Then the app prompts if you want to download updates to the eero software and I tapped yes and that took about 10 minutes or so and went through with no problems at all.  Now one cool thing is that this eero network was TOTALLY ADDITIVE.  The existing Cisco Modem has a wireless network built-in too, and that is still working and available, but now the eero network is added too so there are two networks to choose from, with the eero being the extendable network (I could buy another eero unit and add it to the network if necessary).  I give this product 5 stars and would give it 6 stars if I could!  It's a really easy to deploy great product that works and just adds on to your existing network at least for my network. ",
thepollara,"February 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I have many years of experience with frustrating routers, devices and service providers. Over the years I've encountered nearly every problem known to man around residential internet and wireless networks. If you value having reliable connectivity and have at least six wireless devices then you should totally make the investment in the Eero device.    I also really like having admin control over my devices via the mobile app. The app allows you to boot any device and group them so you know exactly which device is connected and how they contribute to the bandwidth load on your network. Also some really clean features for managing temporary guest networks. I have a vertical layout townhouse, 2,000 sq ft with four floors between the basement and roof terrace. I installed my Eero 3 pack wired via ethernet but I found that even the two pack was very effective. I have 100mbps service with 14 connected devices (5 of which are wired using a gigabit switch). ",
"Paco M. Aubrejuan","April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"I've struggled with wifi coverage in my house for a long time.  My router is at one end of the house, and my television on the other end.  I purchased three different high end routers over the past couple of years, and each of them worked intermittently.  I would have to reboot my router every couple days as my bandwidth at the far end of my house lagged.    I read the review for Eero and saw that it received high scores in two key areas for me:  First, I wanted something that was super simple to install and maintain.  I only need one feature- for the router to work.  Second, I wanted it to be super stable and not cycle between working well and not working well.  I can say now that the Eero is a perfect 10/10 on both of these requirements.  I haven't had to reboot a single time in the last month, and my family has finally stopped complaining about the bad wifi signal.  It is well worth the extra money to finally have a router system that works and continues to work. ",
"Mary Ventura","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"5 years ago I moved from a 1300 sqft home to a 3300 sqft home. And for 5 years I have struggled to get consistent, high quality coverage throughout our space.  I have spent at least $300 in modems, wifi routers and extenders, not to mention hours...sometimes the better part of an entire day setting a network up, only to find equipment isn't compatible and I need to start over.    We had made due with one extender that needed to be reset about 3x week.    When I heard about Eero I was excited, maybe my evenings of crawling out of bed in the middle of a show to reset the signal were over.    They ARE!!! Eero is as amazing as I heard it was!!!  I set the whole system (I bought the 3 pack) up in about 30 minutes- that includes time spent reading the instructions.  We have a network, a personalized password that makes sense...not the weird random series of characters everyone hates but beginners don't know how to change...    (For reference, I don't consider myself a beginner in this work, I am tech savvy and able to work my way through networks and systems, however setting up multiple different extenders on one network proved difficult for me. We had personalized network password before eero).    I can control everything from my phone...not much to control but I can see how many devices are on the signal, turn the device lights off/on, and see the speeds I'm uploading/downloading at.    Also, the diagram says to centralize all the hubs, but due to the odd layout of our house it just wasn't possible. Even without the centralizing we have full signal in every room, including our garages and backyard. We basically cover 1/2 an acre!!! It's not full strength all over, but it's covers the space!    We have been up and running solidly for a month now...no issues!    The CONS-  *I know I should list $$$, however I think the quality of the devices compared to the cost I've spent trying to get what this delivers is fairly comparable...I'd much rather spend the money once on one functional product than little bits at a time trying to make something work that just doesn't ever get there.  *Ethernet outlets are limited. This isn't a huge deal, but our printer is outdated and we needed a way to connect it. Updating printer now. ",
Doug,"June 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I installed this eero (pack of 3 unit) combo mesh system as soon as I received them via Amazon Prime. Because I was also installing Comcast 150mbps Internet service the next day and until installed , I continued to use the slower att DSL solution that day with these new units with a WiFi ssid already configured to my own desired WiFi IDs/passwords. Then using these eero units, I just power cycled then reconnected to the nice/simple Netgear cable modem(CM600-100NAS) I ordered at the same time as I ordered these eero units, just changing a the 10BaseT cable from the att gateway to new Comcast modem when Comcast lit up the service the following day at my house.    With the Comcast service, I wanted better WiFi coverage than supplied by any Comcast gateway integrated router. Plus I did-not want to lease any cablemodem/routher wifi equipment from Comcast (ROI of providing myself less than a year).  It seemed like the eero was a possible clean solution, providing better wifi coverage than available using the gateways provided under lease from my ISP (Comcast).    The eero packaging was very clean and well marked for &#34;how to install&#34; and the iPhone application to do the actual set-up was surprisingly very simple to use. After installing the initial set of eero's with full success, I decided to get fancy as I wanted to get &#34;5 bars of coverage&#34; everywhere in a rather large home footprint along with a separate detached storage area/building, so I ordered a 2nd set of eeros to expand my newly installed wifi mesh network.    After expanding my eero mesh network, all went well again except some results with speedtest.net were more inconsistant than before my eero added expansion. To understand what was going on I rang a call into the eero support line (link to call right on the Iphone eero application(and iphone application easy to use, configure ssids/passwords, adding a guest network, etc). This support call I made is where eero really shined because:  A gentleman named Dave answered the phone at the eeros support number. Dave was not just a phone agent answering and reading from a script. Rather, he was obviously a well educated/experienced IT networking professional with good customer support skills. After reviewing my home network configuration and my concerns, Dave ran a performance test between my eeros and while doing so answered my many rather detailed questions (I'm &#34;retired from IT&#34;) with accuracy which I really appreciated. The quality of Dave's efforts working with me by phone was superb. It turns out I had two erros closer than need be, and in the end Dave's time with me over the phone assisted me in tuning this new eeros mesh network perfectly.  It's been flawless since.    In addition, as a side benefit of the eero design: each remote eero in the mesh network provides a spare 10BaseT port that can be used to connect a hardwired device (TV, PC, switch, etc) if desired, or be used, if a hardwired network is available, as a &#34;backhaul&#34; to the erro that is plugged into the cable modem.    So bottom line, eero provided me a perfect homerun solution.    Doug ",

Now with eero I have 9 devices on wifi with no lags, no buffering, and no slowness at all. I am truely amazed. I would curse my modem, router, and ISP everday because I was constantly power cycling my modem and router multiple times a day.  NOT ANY MORE since I have eero!

"gustav zantanon","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I love old sturdy houses. They don't build 'em like they used to. Unfortunately, in 1873 WIFI was in it's infancy. Check that. It might have only been a glimmer in Jules Verne's or H.G.Wells' eyes. Anyway, these days thick plaster and lath walls soak up a WIFI signal like Bounty Towels on a TV ad. Plus the floor plan of my house puts the Entertainment room on the far end of the house. To explain my inability to connect or the eternal spinning vortex of the buffering icon I have always found lotsa blame with 1-My Internet Service Providers (even switching companies in my frustration) 2-The content providers server farms 3-Poltergeists (I am waiting for the day customer service for the above will invoke this as the best explanation). I tried two different WIFI extenders. There was only a teenie bit of improvement. The second extender claimed to be using both frequencies, but no improvements.    Then I saw a sidebar ad on Amazon (thank you for not using pop-ups) for a new concept in WIFI delivery for the home. Eero uses multiple devices strategically placed through the building to boost the signal. This time I read the directions before I started installing. But hey, I got excited, and soon realized I had plugged all three devices into power and totally out of order. While I was scolding my impetuosity, my Android (smartphone not the little electronic french maid* I also found on Amazon) told me that setup was complete and successful. My immediate skepticism is understandable (see above) so I do what I always do when my mother tells me juicy gossip from her neighborhood--trust but verify. I turned TV on, went to Internet content and clicked on Amazon Prime (seemed to be previously most finicky). To my delight, I watched an entire hour of the excellent series &#34;The Man in the High Castle&#34; without a single buffering pause. Yea. I am going to quit writing so I can get back to binge watching. Hope this helps    *Disclaimer: To the best of my knowledge, Amazon has no current or future plans to offer Android Maids to the general public.

I had a problem before and tried to contact the customer support, their response was super, I got personal help one on one who patiently helped me find the problem.

I'm excited to see some more features for QoS and other aspects like manual ability to restart the routers , mac addressing filtering or IP filtering .

Stark,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have never done an Amazon review before, but I wanted to share the fantastic experience I have had with eeroâ€”both the product and the company.    First, the product: Not much needs to be said except that I now have blazingly fast wifi throughout my house. It could not be easier to set up. The hardware is elegant and unobtrusive, unlike the alien spacecraft that other wifi companies seem to be producing these days. Also, the eero model of constant updates and improvements is far superior to what you will get from other companies. My eeros have already updated themselves several times, with improvements in performance and new features added.    As for the company, I cannot say enough about how great they are to work with. I did have some problems initially with streaming music services not working properly. I contacted eero, and they worked tirelessly to figure out what the problem was. The problem turned out to be related to another component in my network (not the eeros themselves) but they saw it through until the problem was solved. I now have no problems whatsoever with my network and in fact everything works much better than before. Also, unlike with other companies, I did not receive generic emails with general suggestions and links to online help documents. Instead, I exchanged emails with a single customer service representative who actually took the time to respond to my specific questions and worked with me until my problem was solved. For me, this kind of service and attention to detail makes the eero system worth every penny. This is a company that truly cares about its customers and about getting it right.    Conclusion: Buy it, you wonâ€™t be disappointed! ",

That helped... but it was inconsistent - would sometimes provide a great signal on our second floor and in the garage, but often not - which might have been more frustrating than not having it at all. I was always rebooting it to try to get it to work.    I bought the Eero system out of desperation. Didn't want to have to go to a wired system, but didn't have much hope that it would actually do the job. I figured with my Prime membership and Amazon's return policy, I didn't have much to lose. I ordered 4 just to make sure I'd have adequate coverage in our home.    From the moment I plugged them in, things just worked. It was like magic. I didn't want to believe it at first - I kept our other router pumping out it's signal thinking that the Eero network would fail at any moment. It didn't. Ever.

"James Nguyen","February 18, 2017 ",5.0,"Three pack eero replacing a home network with a Netgear R7000 router plugged directly into our FIOS modem, from there were 3 ethernet over power line connections (mixture of Netgear and D-Link) to reach problematic spots for wi-fi reception and in one case, a device that required an ethernet connection, and finally, one Netgear AC750 wireless repeater.  All in all, the stuff all worked, my devices were online, and on the whole, happy.  It wast just simply a lot of stuff to maintain, especially with the odd event like a power outage causing me to have to at times connect/re-connect things, reboot, diagnose, etc.    Save for one  powerline adapter for the one device that requires a hardwire, everything above is replaced with the three eeros and I couldn't be happier......so far.  I feel I need to keep that caveat in place for the time being.  The system has been in place for several days and has worked w/o a hitch (more on that below) whereas the system it replaced has been cobbled together over years and again, mostly did the job well.    Setup was super easy and guided by the app.  I did encounter a slight hiccup on the installation of the first eero as it seemingly required my phone to have an internet connection to be able to proceed w/ the installation wizard.  Problem is that I live in a remote hilltop setting and reliable 3G/4G isn't a given and as such, the wizard crapped out a couple times.  Some awkward positioning of my body with my phone near a window got the phone online and a 3rd run of the wizard breezed through in seconds.  From there, the first eero was pumping out an internet connection that made the addition of the next two devices super quick.    Network speed tests bear out very noticeable improvements, both upstream and downstream for my Southern CA based FIOS service (formerly Verizon, now Frontier).    Prior to this, using my Macbook Pro and Speedtest.Net, downstream speeds averaged around 85 Mb/s give or take 5 Mb/s.  With the eeros, I've been getting very consistent 100-103 Mb/s.  Upstream has been eye opening.  Previous to this, with my Netgear R7000, upstream averaged 30 Mb/s, give or take 5 Mb/s.  With the eeros in place, I have seen ranging from 107 to 118 (!!!) Mb/s.  This has been consistently tested w/ the same laptop and the same speed test from various parts of the home with no noticeable differences from tests run from any part of the home from another.    Perhaps there were configuration errors on my Netgear, but other than the DNS provider and admin password, everything on the machine was left stock.  I'm a fairly technical guy and the Netgear UI (scarily amongst the better ones out there) was so crappy and daunting that I dared not mess with anything.  The eero seemingly has a ton less capability in the app, but if I were being honest with myself, I wasn't using those features on the Netgear either-- e.g. DMZs, QoS, etc.  It would be nice to see more and more advanced features rolled out in the future, but I really don't feel like I'm giving up much.  ESPECIALLY when taking into consideration the reduced footprint of networking gear I have deployed, the fact that the units themselves are far less bulky and eye catching (in a bad way).  And factoring in the improved networking speeds I'm seeing on my actual devices themselves (and not just speedtests run at the router level itself), it makes my decision to swap over a total no brainer and absolutely worth every penny.  Many are balking at the cost, but factoring the cost of all the pieces I previously deployed, I'm fairly sure they surpass the cost of this 3 pack. ",
"Mark Danckert","February 11, 2017 ",5.0,"Purchased two 3-packs October 2016 and installed throughout my house and detached garage - I was up and running in about 20 minutes.  Easiest wifi install ever and blazingly fast speeds with no dead spots - 100% works as advertised.  I use Sonos for music and was having trouble with them - I thought it was the Eero so on Sunday morning I emailed Eero, expecting a reply in a few days - got a reply right away and was on the phone with support within an hour.  They walked me through everything that was going on and it turns out the Eero units were not at fault - they even had tips for how to make the Sonos system perform better.  Best support experience I've ever had - these Eero guys know what they are doing and are crazy responsive - at least Dallas and Jared are. ",
ddlj81,"May 15, 2016 ",5.0,"Extremely easy to setup via the app. Ensures the same wi-fi name can be extended through out the home (unlike some other products).  The app can test download speeds and upload speeds at various points in home. My download speed of iPhone increased 4 times from 24 bps to close to 100 bps consistently (after 24 hrs, the effect is even more prominent). My corner bedroom which used a slow PC got a 3 times boost in download speed. I have tried two other systems before (Azeus and extenders), but this system is the only one you will ever need. My house about 4000 sq feet and since I installed this, there is a huge difference.

DALJONES,"November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I rarely write reviews, but this has proven worthy of my efforts.  On many occasions over the past 10 years, my wifi network has caused me to seriously contemplate liquidating all of my assets and spending my remaining years tracking down the evil geniuses who created them.  I'm not particularly computer savvy, but I've always been able to follow online instructions to do port forwarding or create static ip's and the like.  This however has always been a trap, one that leads me to believe I can manage my wifi network and make it......actually work (imagine that).  After several different routers, a couple of range extenders and countless hours I would have rather been doing anything else, I finally gave up!  Following much research, I took the plunge and paid full price (gulp) for a 3 pack of the Eero's.  This has all been done with Time Warner Cable (if that matters).    The Pros:  1. It took me about 20 minutes to setup the network w/3 Eero's....easily the simplest setup I've ever done!  2. My 2,000 sq. ft. 2 story house and my attached 1,000 sq. ft garage all have very strong wifi.  3. I can nickname my devices so it's easy for me to see what's on the network.  4. I easily grouped devices together that my kids use and set times they can't access wifi.  5. I can access my network to pause/un-pause wifi for specific devices or for everything, even when I'm not home (using the iphone app).  6. I've had it setup for about a week and it's been flawless!  All my speed tests in every area of the house are at my providers max capacity!  7. I had a question about setting up the app for me and my wife.  I called in and was told they were experiencing high call volumes, but someone answered about 10 seconds later and quickly helped me get things done.  8. The iPhone app interface is very easy to use....and it all makes sense.  They've simplified it to be used by actual human beings....ones that don't work on computers for a living.  An example:  I wanted to do some port forwarding....all I had to do was forward the port AND the app actually suggested that I make a static IP so I don't lose the port forwarding if the device doesn't connect to that ip in the future!  I always had to learn that the hard way.  Eero's then took me right to the screen to set the static ip!  9. It actually works...everywhere...all the time...imagine that!    Cons:  1. Somewhat spendy.  However, it's much cheaper than a kidney, or my firstborn....which is what I was contemplating trading to anyone who could solve my wifi dilemmas.    I'll update this review in the future if my Eero's turns on me, betrays my trust, or does anything else you should be warned about. ",

"gustav zantanon","January 3, 2017 ",5.0,"I love old sturdy houses. They don't build 'em like they used to. Unfortunately, in 1873 WIFI was in it's infancy. Check that. It might have only been a glimmer in Jules Verne's or H.G.Wells' eyes. Anyway, these days thick plaster and lath walls soak up a WIFI signal like Bounty Towels on a TV ad. Plus the floor plan of my house puts the Entertainment room on the far end of the house. To explain my inability to connect or the eternal spinning vortex of the buffering icon I have always found lotsa blame with 1-My Internet Service Providers (even switching companies in my frustration) 2-The content providers server farms 3-Poltergeists (I am waiting for the day customer service for the above will invoke this as the best explanation). I tried two different WIFI extenders. There was only a teenie bit of improvement. The second extender claimed to be using both frequencies, but no improvements.    Then I saw a sidebar ad on Amazon (thank you for not using pop-ups) for a new concept in WIFI delivery for the home. Eero uses multiple devices strategically placed through the building to boost the signal. This time I read the directions before I started installing. But hey, I got excited, and soon realized I had plugged all three devices into power and totally out of order. While I was scolding my impetuosity, my Android (smartphone not the little electronic french maid* I also found on Amazon) told me that setup was complete and successful. My immediate skepticism is understandable (see above) so I do what I always do when my mother tells me juicy gossip from her neighborhood--trust but verify. I turned TV on, went to Internet content and clicked on Amazon Prime (seemed to be previously most finicky). To my delight, I watched an entire hour of the excellent series &#34;The Man in the High Castle&#34; without a single buffering pause. Yea. I am going to quit writing so I can get back to binge watching. Hope this helps    *Disclaimer: To the best of my knowledge, Amazon has no current or future plans to offer Android Maids to the general public. I believe you need to sign up for Amazon Prime** to make such a purchase.  **No, that's not true either. Good bye. ",

buzzaxe,"July 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I Comcast as internet provider. I have a 3-level house and modem is in basement.The struggle has been to get WiFi to the rest of the house. The modem by itself was not effective at all. Like many, I tried to extend to the rest of the house using WiFi extenders (plug in to wall type). These worked ok but I still could only get between 18 and 46 Mbps. I was thinking this was as good as it was going to get until I saw the eero product.  I purchased the 3-pack and was impressed with how easy it was to setup (via iPhone app). Connected the first to the basement modem which created a new WiFi network and then connected the others throughout the house. I placed one on the first floor and one on the second floor. The eero app you download helps to get everything setup and could not believe how easy it was. I am now consistently running between 112-125 Mbps regardless of where I am at in the house. I also run multiple Xbox one consoles and Netflix, YouTube, etc. are no longer dropping connections.  I was able to get the $100 discount so my price for the 3 pack was $399. For me it was well worth because frustration with dropped or slow connections has stopped.    One quirk is that after setting up one of the eero, I had to move it but could not get it to reconnect. My solution was to remove it from the network with the iPhone app, reset the device (on the back of the eero using a needle/safety pin), and then adding back to the network using the app. Worked great after that.    Would definitely recommend this although the price is a little steep. ",

My eero system was easy to set up and get working, but took some tweaking (with the placement of the devices - working with eero tech support) to REALLY dial up the performance.    Initial setup was simple once I turned my phone's bluetooth on...the first time I tried (with bluetooth off) it failed (obvious, in hindsight).  After my setup was complete, my wifi performance was as-good (and sometimes better) than my existing wifi network, which consisted of three (3) Apple Airport Extreme base stations, which mostly adequately covered most/all of my house but which did experience the occasional (always frustrating) dropouts.

"Amazon Customer","November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"This is the wifi I have been waiting for! I am absolutely amazed at how well this works. I will admit, I was skeptical especially after trying everything else. I have tried moving my wireless router out in the open, trying multiple extenders in multiple locations, changing ISP companies, and nothing has helped. The eero system simply works and works very well. I never write reviews, but I feel like this product warranted one. The price is right at the amount where you can't just impulse buy something like this. It took me several weeks to pull the trigger, but knowing what I know now, I would have bought eero a long time ago. My internet speeds in areas that were previous dead zones are faster now than what I was getting standing right next to my previous router. If it keeps working this well, I will be a customer for life. ",
K.F.,"July 6, 2016 ",5.0,"Despite a few hiccups, the system has been great.    My setup: I have a ~1400 sq ft, 2 story home. I bought 2 eeros so that I could place one downstairs (with my modem) and one upstairs where I used to have issues with connectivity. Prior to purchasing the eero system I had a tplink router and a tplink wifi extender plugged in upstairs. This worked in some cases but I had issues with devices dropping the network and even one device that would/could not connect to the wifi at all. My home has a second floor hallway which is open to the first floor.    Pros: I am getting faster internet. Devices are no longer dropping off the network. All my devices can now connect. The eero looks sleek and the app is pretty easy to use.    Cons: The system seems to be a bit finicky when it comes to placement of the eeros. It said to have the eero at person level but the only way I could get the upstairs eero to connect was to move the downstairs eero up onto a ~8 ft high shelf. Now, the two eeros have line of sight without any walls but it was still a little bit of a dance to get them to &#34;see&#34; each other. Maybe once you have them connected you can move them more easily. I don't have a need to since it works as is, but it wasn't as straight forward a process as I had hoped. Enough to make it not worth it? No. Enough to mention? I think so. Also I messed up connecting an ethernet switch, but once I explained my problem, it was updated on the help site. All in all, I think highly of the company and the product. ",
CSherr,"July 17, 2016 ",5.0,"Man, I really, really wanted these to work. The setup on them was *way* faster than the Linksys Velops. Their range is lower than the Velops, but I was okay with that because all I wanted was consistent, reliable wifi. While they started out slower than the linksys, they were still fast enough for everything we needed. The problem comes that within a week or two the speed drops off to almost nothing. I had my macbook pro literally 2 feet from one of the hardwired base stations. I was getting 2mbps. I restarted the base station (which requires you to unplug/plug it back in). After it came back up, I was getting 180mbps again. Not having to restart the eeros was the only reason I bought them (i.e. rock solid wifi). Their support was fairly good, but we never could get them to work 100%. So, I returned them. At this point, I'm back to using 4 airport extremes (all hardwired) around my house. I haven't had any issues since. ",
"eero support","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"We had an older WiFi with an extender that gave us constant headaches -- we often had to unplug the units several times a day and signal strength was uneven throughout our large house. After doing research on the eero vs. Google's unit, we decided on the eero not only because of the good reviews (in Amazon and in the technical press) but also because Google requires you to make the unit part of the ever-creeping Google ecosystem that watches everything you do in searches, emails, and the like, and adds it to the profile it keeps for you in order to sell ads more targeted to how they have you categorized. I would rather have my WiFi system just do its work without whispering about me to Google in the background!    The system is dead easy to set up -- literally, we just plugged and played, following the directions in the app. It worked right out of the box. Since installing eero, we have had flawless service - no interruptions and signal strength throughout the house is high.    The design of the units is sleek and unobtrusive. Although we didn't need to ask for help, apparently the support offered is excellent.    This works as well as any modern internet product we have put into service in recent years.

I would curse my modem, router, and ISP everday because I was constantly power cycling my modem and router multiple times a day.  NOT ANY MORE since I have eero!

Shopgirl17,"March 12, 2017 ",5.0,"Just go buy this thing if you want flawless wifi all over your house and yard.  I bought this product with the hopes of having good wifi around my pool and that I could put Sonos speakers (that run on wifi) in my gazebo by my pool.  It works better than I could've ever imagined.  My previous setup had spotty reception at the back door.  Now I have full bars consistently on the other side of my pool (probably 50 ft from the back door). I was able to setup Sonos speakers out there and it works like a charm.    The setup for this is about as easy as it gets. You might have to play with it a little bit once you get it setup with the placement of each Eero for maximum performance, but you could probably put them anywhere and it would work great. I tried them in a couple of different rooms, they worked great everywhere, but some configuration seemed to work a little better than others.    Yes, it's expensive.  Like some reviews will tell you, if your a smart guy, you could probably rig up your own custom open mesh network that would the same for a fraction of the cost.  But I don't know how to do that, nor do I want to learn...I just want my wifi to work.  I recently cut the cable cord and we watch everything over streaming internet now, so I was able to justify this to my self.  This cost is just a few months of savings from not having a cable bill.    There's a lot of cool little features the app has too.  I probably don't know them all, but it has a built in way to run a speed test.  It somehow makes my wifi faster.  My plan is &#34;up to 25mbps&#34; and before, I would get a wide range of results from 2-18mbps.  Rarely ever 20+.  Now with Eero, 28mbps is the norm.  It has an option where you can just text your network name and password to others you want to allow on your network.  There's also a way to create a guest network, which i haven't done yet, but seems like it would be ideal for maybe a Fantasy Football draft where you could grant a bunch of people temporary access to your network and then remove it afterwards.

The best part for me has been &#34;administering&#34; the network remotely through the iOS app. I have some guests staying at my place, and I didn't have to run over there to set up a guest network for them and change the password. You can also keep tabs on how many devices are on the network at any time.    In my case, the wireless router (TP-Link) that I replaced was acceptable. The eeros just penetrate more of the house. I plan to experiment more with placement, as I plan to add at least one wifi security camera to the network. It would be a good feature if the eero smartphone app guided you on placement or told you if, for example, moving one of the devices to a new location helped or hurt.

After trying multiple types of wifi routers, including twice getting the latest generation AirPort Extreme router, I was frustrated with dropouts, start stops, timeouts, and interrupted streaming.    I'm not entirely sure, but I do think there were issues with the AirPort and my ISP around DNS, where some of the stuttering was due to IP address resolution potentially due to the IPv6 neighbor discovery protocol.  Or, perhaps it was crowding on the frequency due to 15 in range networks.    Regardless, by plugging in two Eeros (in 5 minutes), all those problems VANISHED and my internet speeds from my wifi devices increased by an order of magnitude.  I now have a third Eero for redundancy. They work like a charm.    Simple, fast, perhaps not inexpensive - nonetheless I recommend without reservation. ",

It takes a little time for devices to switch over, so I sometimes have to turn airplane mode off/on quickly to get the strongest signal. If you wait a few minutes, it does it usually automatically.  Important &#62; if you want to direct wire them, then you CANNOT just connect them all to a switch (unless I got that info wrong). After some research, I found that you have to connect the primary directly to your router with the one Ethernet port and then connect the 2nd Ethernet port to your switch. There should be a bit more documentation on that. ",
"Michael Green","April 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I installed two of these in a small house and the coverage is outstanding. That's not surprising given the size of the house, but the more interesting thing is how well the devices work. With multiple access points, I used to have to occasionally mess with WiFi on my phone to get it to associate with  the device with the strongest signal. At other times, I would have to take extra steps to get things to connect with WiFi at all. After installing the eero access points, I don't even have to think about WiFi. Another feature that is a positive is how the system updates. It just happens and you get notified. No downloading firmware and rebooting. It's not that hard to update firmware on an access point, but it's much nicer to know that the system is just taking care of that and then letting you know. It really is the case that these are very easily installed and then just work. That says lots about the care and thought that went into the engineering and user experience design. ",
