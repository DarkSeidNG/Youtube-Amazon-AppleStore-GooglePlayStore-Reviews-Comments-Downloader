"Roy Estaris","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.  Happy Holidays  Roy ",
DJ,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.    If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!    Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.    1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.    2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.    3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, &#34;Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees&#34; got no result, so I tried &#34;Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees&#34; and she picked it up perfectly.    4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.    5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  &#34;Alexa, play 90s music&#34;, &#34;Alexa, play indie music&#34;, and &#34;Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds&#34;.  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great &#34;freebie&#34; if you're a prime member.    6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.    7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.    8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to &#34;Alexa, what's the definition of&#34;, &#34;Alexa, how far away is&#34;, &#34;Alexa, Wikipedia&#34; (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask &#34;Alexa, tell me more&#34;).  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.    9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).    Suggestions for Improvement:    1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like &#34;How far away is the sun&#34; but I'd really like too see Amazon add a &#34;search&#34; function.    2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.    3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings. ",
"Bryant R.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.  A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.  So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.  The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.  I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.  Thanks for letting me rant ",
RaVen,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!  This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say &#34;alexa&#34; and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.    We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its &#34;multi-room voice recognition&#34; technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word &#34;alexa&#34; on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a &#34;multi-device&#34; plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited      The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.  The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.    At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is &#34;alexa turn on the lights&#34; and our downstairs lights spring into action.    My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with &#34;sorry I didn't get that&#34;  Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.    Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your &#34;free&#34; music.    I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up &#34;New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing&#34; under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.    I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device. ",
"Brian C","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.    I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.    My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo &#34;skills&#34; that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the &#34;skills&#34; not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.    Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.    The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached. ",
Andrew,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"This was my first Echo purchase and I am overall very pleased with it's performance. Initially, I was worried that it was going to be a Siri knockoff with only a limited number of voice commands and functions with constant errors; however, I have not received single error response since I have owned it. I am an Amazon Prime member and from the time I clicked confirm purchase to the time it was delivered to my doorstep only took 3 days, and best part of all, shipping was free.    I currently have mine sitting by my bed and have synced it with the app, available on for all phone types, which allows me to carry out a number of voice commands including: &#34;Alexa, set an alarm for..., check the weather, play Pandora, or tell me a joke.&#34; The app interface is a little clunky at times, but you're able to see the history of recent requests, and Alexa is constantly learning and adapting to your specific commands and style.    If you are looking to buy an Echo Dot because you want a cheap introduction into Bluetooth connectivity with household lights, televisions, gaming systems, thermostats, or other Echo products then buy this Echo Dot. I am working with a grad student budget, and for $50 dollars this sleek and sexy &#34;command station&#34; was worth every penny. I did not receive any compensation for this review, I am writing it because I debated on buying one for about a week before pulling the trigger, and I just want to speed up the process for people like me who may be waffling...trust me, its completely worth the $50.

"Amazon Customer","December 14, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly, I love mine but obviously, there are some things that could be better. What do I love about it? Both my boyfriend and I downloaded the app and have access to a shopping list that we can both use at the grocery store depending on who is there. With a simple wake up word (her name) and the command of adding an item to the shopping list, it appears in the app. I can ask for a flash briefing and NPR news is retrieved and I am caught up all over the world in subjects from politics all the way to sports news. She also gives great weather information so that I am able to plan for my day ahead. Alexa can learn many skills that continue to evolve. Knowledge from what wines to pair with what meats and good cooking substitutes to helping with a drinking game and other games & trivia. Alexa comes in handy when I need a hands-free timer in the kitchen or an alarm for a nap. Now, what I don't really like but can get passed it once I get the hang of it. Sometimes you ask a question but she doesn't understand the question but you reword the question and she is able to understand it. So just be sure your wording the question correctly. Also, remember that Alexa is always listening. ",
"Kathryn H.","March 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Love the Echo Dot. I got the buy 3 discount, which makes it worth while. I am sure there will be more things added and improved on in time, but so far it is a bit limited in what I can use it for. We don't have a modern set up in our house so that it can adjust lights or temp so that part is useless to us.  I got it mostly for my 93 year old mother whom I take care of, as she constantly asks me what day or time it is, so now she can ask the Echo. I also like the ability to get a weather report for the day, and I still need to set up the calendar for daily events for mom, once I get that set up it will be another great advantage in having this. I hope they can come up with a way to make this an intercom also between rooms so that if she needs me at any time Echo can alert me in some way. That alone would make this a really great item worth five stars.  So far my favorite feature is the radio, I just ask it to play a particular type of music and it comes on. You do have to be specific about how to get the type of music you want to hear rather than just ask it to play a particular genre. I also like that you can vocally tell it to turn down or up the volume, and to skip the song playing and it goes to the next one. I don't use it to shop with, might be helpful to some. Also, it does take a little adjusting to the way some people speak, my voice is clear but moms is a little muffles so it took a few times of asking questions to get it use to her voice, now it works good for her. The distance to where it can hear you is good and volume on answering and music is great, you don't really need added speakers unless you want to hear it over a very large room, or whole house.  Pros: Received quickly with free Prime shipping, ability to play music, ask for date, time, and weather without touching anything, get answeres to a lot of questions, and the ability to update and improve over time. Volume is great for small to medium size rooms, and several feet away form it. Great price for 3.  Cons: Still some limitations, no intercom set up yet, need to be specific about where to get radio from. ",
Vince,"April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I have the regular Echo and it's amazing. I bought the Echo Dot for my dad who had been using a little antenna radio around the house. This isn't mobile but it allows him to play Pandora or just to tell it what kind of music to play. It was purchased through my account but I created an Amazon account for him so I could link Pandora to it. That way he has his own Pandora account. Echo can switch accounts at any time with a voice command but we keep them on the primary users' account. I was worried the audio quality wouldn't be any good based on reviews but it's really not bad at all if you're replacing a little radio. It's not audiophile fill the room with brilliance quality, but it gets the music out and doesn't sound tinny or anything. My dad really enjoys it. ",
"Marquino Gadget guru","April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"This is what I`ve been waiting for!!!!  It is simple amazing what you can do with technology nowadays, Amazon is always innovating and staying on top with technology.  This new Amazon Echo Dot does what it says it does and provides all the necessary information by simply asking!  We like it to much i got a second device to add it in my room, been able to connect to your Bluetooth speakers and devices you can automate lots of things.  Great job Amazon ",
"Keirstyn G.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I would like to give a testimonial about this product my sisters and I purchased the echo Dot for my mother for Christmas who is handicapped. She stays at home by herself most days and has limited access to what she can do do to being legally blind and having a neurological disorder. Now she is able to do so many things for herself that she was unable to do for many many years. A few days after Christmas I walked over to her house in the morning to help her out and I could hear music playing and then I hear her yell out Alexa thumbs down that song. I laughed because she was upstairs laying in bed listening to music she said she'd been listening all morning and it made her so happy. This has really been a life-changing gift. Before this she was unable to turn on the TV herself or turn on her music and had a hard time with her tablet turning her audible books on now all she has to do is speak to Alexa and it has opened a whole new world for her ",

"Bryan Warren","April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable. Here's the basics. Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power. On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use. Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables. Using this rig through my phones hotspot along with Amazons unlimited music to replace XM radio for only $3.99 a month plus full functionality of hands free Alexa services. ",
Manders,"April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"I like the Dot quite a bit, but it could be better. I'm not sure if it is the ALEXA program that the Dot connects to or if it is the Bing Search engine, I will have to do some more testing. Some times it can't find info it should be able to. Playing Music works Great!!! The Built in speaker is OK. But if you connect it to a really good speaker with either an Audio Cable or Bluetooth it sounds Great!! I am having the Dot read a Kindle book to me. It works well but the inflections in the text to speech program need work. However that is not a limitation of the device but of current technology. Getting local weather or movies works well. Alexa can &#34;learn&#34; other &#34;Skills&#34; but you have to tell Alexa to use the skill. It would be better if these skills were available all the time, and didn't have to be &#34;turned on&#34;. The Dot does not have a battery, so if you unplug it, it will need to search and connect to your WIFI again when you plug it back in. A great work around is to get a small battery pack (needs a least a 1 amp output port) and keep it plugged into the battery pack and then plug the battery pack into a wall charger. This allows the Dot to be truly portable. I had mine in my shirt pocket and was listening to a book while putting up Christmas lights outside for at least two hours. The Dot works Great, I am hoping that Alexa herself will get smarter. ",
"Kindle Customer","December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"EDIT: All thanks to Amazon's customer service, I learned why my Echo was not working. It must be 8&#34; -12&#34; away from a wall. Our Echo Dot works when against an interior wall but not against an exterior wall where it had previously been situated. We adore &#34;Alexa&#34; and hope the Echo Dot will soon add a great speaker to its features. For the price, this is a fantastic device. And, it's diminutive size makes it easy to use. Still, our family prefers full-size Echo. Thanks, Amazon for the email help with Echo Dot!  *****  We are an Amazon device family. And, with the exception of this device, have had wonderful experiences.    Echo Dot remains connected until the next time I use it. Literally, I reconnect Echo Dot to our network, ask it a few questions, play some music, walk away. When I return Echo has spontaneously disconnected itself and requires the reconnection procedure again.    We have two full size Echos and have no connection issues with them. They operate flawlessly. ",
"Amazon fan","December 15, 2016 ",5.0,"After using the Echo Dot for more than a month, I am sure it was worth buying it !! I am loving all the things it can do and sometimes its fun to ask silly questions. The biggest advantage is to be able to turn your TV  on and off without looking for remote when you come tired from work.    After reading a few blogs about using Echo for automation at home, I have now started working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi to design some new circuits to integrate Echo to control lights and other appliances and to do more with navigation on TV. I am loving it and would recommend it!! ",
Kainesmith.ky,"April 13, 2017 ",4.0,"I really like the echo dot so far. It has a few issues though which I will outline below.    She tends to speak when not spoken to.  I am a 30 year old male that lives alone and it makes me jump every time but because I'm a big brave man I fight through the fear. Jokes aside though, if it were an older person who lives alone I could really see that being a problem. I'll be sitting watching tv and she will ask me to repeat my question or state a random answer to a question that I did not ask, maybe she picks up the tv I'm not sure.  If there is any other noise what so ever she doesn't pick up the wake up word, so be prepared to mute the tv, tell everyone to be quiet and then say Alexa, or in my case echo. I have had to say echo releatedly a few times.    Some good about it is the surprisingly good sound of the speaker when it's playing music. It is much better than I expected after reading some of the reviews.  I like the &#34;to do list&#34; and &#34;shopping list&#34; feature which I add to the lists in the app for more clarity then have her read them back to me every morning. I also like asking for world news every morning when I first get up.  It looks neat also and over all for the price I think it is worth it even if it only played music upon command from across the room. I can see myself using her for that the most. ",
Aphonic,"January 23, 2017 ",4.0,"The far field mic in the second gen do the is way better than the full size echo.  Now if they could just use a source for weather that was even remotely accurate I'd be happy.  Accuweather is ten degrees off a tank my location always. Minimum.  The dot works well.  It's a good cheap way to get alexa.  The speaker quality is fine for audio books and news briefings. Not for music.  It seems faster to respond than the full size echo (1st generation). I believe it's a better option to buy this and pair a nice bt speaker than buy the full echo st this point.  One star off for missing some basic features.  Like accurate weather and basic google searching.  It's useful for my home automation but I still  Find the echo line of products of very limited use outside of that.  Good for a kitchen timer or wake up  Alarm.  Good for some news.  Needs much better podcast management to be very useful.  Oh yah. And accurate weAther.  Amazon prime music is a. Nice touch as is music unlimited for the echo at $3.99 a month. ",
Dion,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I bought 16 of these and gave most of them out as Christmas presents. When I bought my first one in 2015 I was impressed with the questions I asked and the responses I received. These past 5 months or so I believe Alexia must have gone in for a lobotomy. Seldom understands the question. Upgraded to the Prime Music. For how large they say the music library is, I have it ask an average of 3 times before it sometimes plays the song I requested. Yes you can load all sorts of &#34;skills&#34; but they need to come up with a way to allow you to print or even e-mail the skills and commands to yourself. ",
william,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.    Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.    Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it. ",
"Chris Hockaday","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Biggest piece of junk ever. It worked great for 1 day. Then I unplugged it and plugged back in and it just spins with a blue light and is completely unresponsive, can't even reset the device.  I've googled everything I can think of to try but nothing works.  I get that stuff doesn't always work perfectly and has issues, but the biggest problem is that there is no customer support.  There is no phone number to call, or online tech support to help when your device isn't working properly.  I guess I'll throw it away. ",

StuE,"March 12, 2017 ",1.0,"I resisted buying any personal assistant until now. I don't have a 'connected home' and my entertainment system is on Google Player / Chromecast so it won't integrate with the Echo. So why 5 stars if I don't have even a few of the peripheral devices?    It costs $49.99 and I'm a Prime member - that's enough to make it worthwhile. &#34;Alexa, play 70s Rock Classics station&#34;. And for the next several hours I'm entertained.    Note to anyone in the digital advertising world: Echo uses Bing search and provides local results based on Yelp. All answers are also sent to the app on the smartphone paired to the Echo device. Geez, Bing? Yelp? Oh well, Echo can answer most questions...    Four years ago I was given a very good Vizio accessory speaker that worked with the iPad version 2. That iPad tanked last year and the newer Apple products don't use the larger USB connector so I thought the speaker was trash. Using the mini-pin output from Echo to the speaker I now have enough sound to fill the first floor of our house and reclaimed a speaker that would have been tossed to the curb. One advantage of the corded speaker connection - I don't have to re-do pairing ever, a common occurrence with any of my Bluetooth speakers.    I am looking for a white-light set of wi-fi enabled bulbs (boring, but useful) as a first step toward home automation.    I really want an Echo solution that can manage our TV with Hulu / Amazon / Netflix / Sling / YouTube. (Google Play would be a huge bonus. Because competitors). If I could replace the massive (and to some confusing) Harmony TV remote with voice commands life would be good. I can't find anyone who says they have successfully managed this set of tasks. Yes, the new Fire Stick is Alexa-enabled, but I'd prefer one listening device rather than two.    I considered the Google product and chose the Amazon Echo instead. While Google may have better search capabilities, I'm pretty well covered between phone and computers. I saw the Echo Dot as a low-cost entry point where I could salvage a good sounding compact speaker system AND dip my toe into home automation without spending a fortune. Next year? Who knows, but for right now the Echo Dot was exactly what I was looking for. ",
tonyb,"March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"This echo dot refuses to stay connected to Wi-Fi.  It initially connects without a problem. It works for short time, then it just stops.   I keep resetting it back to factory settings,  but it still does not connect.   I have had three echo's for quite a while and have never once had an issue with any of them.  This is the second dot have tried, and I have had the exact same issue with both of them. ",
TwistedTree,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Lasted just about 6 months, then started failing. We would give a command, and the dot would sit and think about answering. Stops in the middle of playing music. We ask it to turn off the lights using a wink hub, lights stay on and dot replies OK or the lights instantly go off, then the dot takes 2 to 3 minutes to respond OK. Ask it to tell us a joke, it tells the joke, but stops before giving the punch line. We have a full size echo that works fine, and we have tried moving the dot next to the echo to see if it was having issues with the wifi range, no change. Reset to factory defaults and setup from scratch, no change. We finally contacted tech support, who where useless. Bounced us around to 4 different techs in less then 5 minutes, where hung up on then finally told the case would be escalated to tier 2 support.

Artemaria,"March 9, 2017 ",1.0,"At first, I thought that this would just be like a voice-controlled Siri that is always on, but  after living with it for several months it seems as if it is so much more.  While not perfect, the speech recognition and accuracy are on a par with Google Assistant, and that accuracy along with the &#34;instant on&#34; feature is what makes this so easy to use.  The literature is not the clearest on this, but you don't really need a speaker for the Echo Dot, and we usually don't use it with the speaker, because the built in speaker is more than loud and clear enough for Alexa's speaking voice in the 20 x 16 room where we have it stationed.  If you want to play music and have the music sound rich and full, then you should hook it up to a nice Bluetooth speaker.  We use the Logitech Boom and it works very well, usually pairing flawlessly with the Echo Dot with very little effort, and great sound.    What makes the Echo Dot a little different and perhaps more fun to use than its competitors are the &#34;skills&#34; that are built into it.  I'm not going to go into the details of all the things that it can do because you can read about them on c/net or some other tech site, but what I will tell you is that there are alot of &#34;skills&#34; that are not at all pragmatic or useful, but that make the Echo Dot/Alexa alot more fun than the competition.  There's a storytelling feature, where Alexa will tell you a not so great bedtime story.  But what makes it so engaging are the thoughtfully interspersed comments in that story, such as &#34;no, you can't get any water,&#34; and &#34;that's your last story, and its time for you to go to sleep,&#34; which seem so human and so clever.  The Echo Dot/Alexa also will tell you the news, the weather and instantaneously provide any other current-events related information that you may want to hear while cooking dinner or getting dressed for work.    Along, these same lines, Alexa will tell you a joke, and will answer questions about various topics including about other AI platforms which she does in a polite and diplomatic fashion with a response like &#34;I like all AIs.&#34;  In reality, however, this is not true.  Neither Alexa, nor Google Assistant, nor Siri are true AIs.  They are merely the latest in voice recognition hardware and software that, through brute force algorithm calculations performed on a server far from your home, determines a high-probability acceptable response to the combination of words that served as its verbal input.  Because Alexa is cannot make any decisions on its own, it is not a true AI.  Thus, if your internet service is slow or off, Alexa will not work, leaving you with a $50 paperweight.  We've not had that issue, but it is something to consider if your internet service is not the best and you are considering buying this device.    In the end, this is a fun foray in to the world of voice-activated assistants.  And while Amazon's database of verbal input grows, paving the way for a true AI someday, Alexa may be the recognized as one of the first pioneering digital assistant devices that trained people to verbally interact with technology in their home.

NC-Ron,"March 27, 2017 ",1.0,"My wife and I had thought about getting Dots for the grand kids for Christmas but the reviews at that time were incomplete and confusing about what the dot would do and how they might interact/interfere with each other in the same household.  Well, we now own an Echo, a Tap and two Dots. They are all great.    Myth 1.  You do NOT need Echo to use a Dot. Dot is autonomous. It responds to Alexa commands just like Echo, and can control remote devices just as well.    Myth 2. You MUST have external speakers. Not so. The speaker in Dot is no great shakes, but it works. The audio output to a good set of powered speakers is great.    Myth 3. If you use Echo, or Dot or Tap, you cannot have two or more doing different things. Not so. I can have Alexa via Echo playing Clapton in the living room and have Alexa via Dot playing the Dead in the bedroom, at the same time, with just one Amazon Prime account, not even the Prime Music account.    Other:  Both Dot and Echo have to be plugged into 115 v all the time to work. The Tap is rechargeable and bluetooth so it is portable. Great feature. We use Echo and Dot to control TP-Link smart plugs and smart switches. They work great. (I love the TP-Link stuff, maybe another review. But Alexa at my house can control the smart stuff at our beach place 250 miles away. In fact you have to be precise in your language with Alexa or she'll be turning stuff on and off in the other location...)    I actually haven't tried the Tap yet with remotes (it's at the beach and I'm not), but I assume it will work just as well. The only caveat is that you have to 'enable remote' on the smart plugs, etc. in order to have Alexa turn them on and off. Some folks are leery about doing that. If I get hacked and some clown wants to turn off my bedroom light, so be it. (I can monitor the status of all the smart devices with the KASA app for TP-Link and my smart phone.)    Dot is a little bigger than a hockey puck and makes a great alarm clock. ",
ComputerGuy,"April 26, 2017 ",5.0,"For $50 and what it does, how can you go wrong? Answer is, you can't. This thing is awesome. Not a whole lot bigger than a hockey puck. With all the power of the Full Sized Echo less the better speaker. Since you can pair with a Blue Tooth Speaker or plug it in via cable which the full unit currently doesn't, there's really no downside to this thing. Setup in minutes, new skills easily added. 2 Million songs available if you have Amazon Prime. I've got it controlling a Smart LED Bulb I purchased a few days after I received the Echo Dot. I purchased a second one for my brother who's Bed Ridden in a care facility and he loves it. He's a Trivia and Facts Buff so he went to town using it to search Wikipedia for all sorts of info. He's also using it to play his favorite Radio Station.    If you are interested in this device, ignore the low rating reviews. The speaker is fine, yes it's small and not super powerful but there is no quality issue with it. It's like using a small portable radio (not a boombox). If you're an Audiophile or need loud music, hook it up to a stereo or high end Bluetooth speaker, don't trash it because it won't shake your windows with the built in speaker.    It's sound pickup is fine as well. I put one upstairs in my house and it can hear me from other rooms upstairs just fine. Unless you are talking like a mouse or have it blasting music or something making it hard for it to pickup your voice. I purchased a second for my downstairs part of the house and with it centrally located, I've got the entire house covered with 2 and it's always within range of my voice. My Girlfriend has a slight speech issue and it understands her fine too.    I may buy a 3rd to dedicate to my Home Entertainment center and plug it into the stereo. I should have purchased 3 with the promotion of getting $20 for buying 3, but I wanted to test one out first. In any case, even without the Buy 3 promotion, you still come in under the $176 for the Full echo. I don't have the full Echo so I can't compare, but from everything I've read, and what i've experienced with my Dots, I see nothing wrong with them and feel they are a major margin. And I don't feel the need to get the full unit at this point just to have a better speaker. ",
Ken,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I haven't had a chance to play with &#34;Alexa&#34; that much.  I'll ask her what the time is just to keep her awake.  My wife thinks that is silly.  I'll ask her to Wikipedia technical items, and she is ready to tell me all.  I of course got her her own leather jacket, and so far have introduced her to the WiFi thermostat.  It was cold in the house this morning, so I asked her to set the THERMOSTAT to 69.  She did it, and that one degree made my morning.  Of course I had her set it back.  I was watching a documentary on Netflix, and one of the people in the show was named Alexi.  That was close enough for Alexa, even though said by the TV.    I've added a Z wave hub and will add some 3-way WiFi switches, and be able to have Alexa turn lights on and off by voice command.  Someone needs to write a book on all the possible ways to do this.

"Joey Espinosa","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"THE GOOD:  Lots of &#34;Skills&#34; (which you can think of as apps) that enable the Echo to do various other things. You can even build your own (if you're willing to write some code) and give the Echo a whole range of new features. There are some great Skills already out there. For instance, if you use OurGroceries on your phones to track your grocery list, you can enable a Skill that links that to the Echo, so you can say &#34;Alexa, tell OurGroceries to add eggs to the Food List.&#34; And Alexa will do just that.    Additionally, there are built-in features that are pretty good and up to date. I kept asking Alexa what the score was during the Super Bowl, and it knew almost right away when the score had changed.    THE BAD:  The Echo's ability to understand is very limited. It can comprehend some range of questions with certain key words, but it cannot understand context one bit. You can't ask &#34;What movie won Best Picture at the Oscars?&#34; and then follow up with &#34;Who directed it?&#34; You'll get the answer to the first one, but the second will result with the &#34;Sorry, I don't understand&#34; response that Echo owners know OH SO WELL.    Specifically with the Dot, the speaker is not great. I can understand, since it's so cheap ($50), but it's really not great. I keep a Dot in the kitchen (because it's useful there with timers and such), and I can barely hear it about 20 feet away in the living room when watching TV, even at full volume.    THE UGLY:  &#34;Alexa, stop.&#34; &#34;Alexa, stop!&#34; &#34;ALEXA, STOP!!!&#34;  If you're an Echo owner, I'm sure you've run into this. When the timer alarm goes off, or the Echo inexplicably begins doing something because it thought it heard its trigger, or it misunderstands what you wanted and begins playing a sample of some music you did not ask for... and you can do nothing to shut it off, even without background noise! It will just keep going until you find yourself with your face 6 inches from a tiny hockey puck-shaped device yelling at the top of your lungs, pleading with it to end the suffering already and STOP.    No, &#34;Okay, Google&#34; is not as mellifluous as &#34;Alexa&#34;. But I'll tell you what it's also not: COMMON. &#34;Makes&#34;, &#34;treks&#34;, &#34;plex&#34;, &#34;fix a&#34;, even the word &#34;breakfast&#34;, they can all sound like &#34;Alexa&#34;. We've gotten so used to Alexa providing her own commentary at random times throughout the day that we've accepted it as our newfound peanut gallery. Sometimes it's actually funny, but it is never helpful. That super annoying 2 Broke Girls commercial (I hate that show) where she walks in and thinks she's burned 500 calories but then she realizes it's actually the time on her watch (I mean come on, writers)? Yep, Alexa responds like clockwork with the current time. The ironic part is that Alexa can apparently hear the TV perfectly fine, but I can barely hear Alexa from the room where the TV is in. I can't imagine anybody having this thing near a television and NOT changing the trigger word from &#34;Alexa&#34; to something else.    And if you try to say what's in the title of this review (&#34;Alexa, order me a Google Home&#34;), Alexa will tell you she can't. I'd consider it a funny joke from the folks at Amazon, but considering what I've seen so far, it's more likely just incapable. ",
"Amazon Customer","February 3, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought one for Christmas than I got one for a present, I thought that if you had prime you where good on music I was wrong you have to pay 4 bucks a month and it does not mean you can listen to full songs on all your echo dots , Nope only one. Its 4 dollars for each one. I started to realize Amazon is pinching for every dime I got. 100 bucks for prime and than more for music. I am over Amazon. I got a Google home and I like it more it throws YouTube videos to my TV. I already had the family music plan that comes with YouTube red. Also google music is the best music service. I can find anything I want to here that Spotify or Amazon does not have. The echo works but it reminds me of Xbox vs PlayStation the xbox you have to pay more for what already come with the PlayStation. The home gives you 6 month free of service also. Echo works but you have to keep feeding it money. The google home works better with Android phones also. the home is still growing because it just came out but I think it will surpass the echo in a year. Now I have to see if someone will buy these from me because I don't want them anymore. One last thing the google works better with my hue lights. Ok google show me a video of someone smashing the echo dot on my TV. ",

Mind you I was thinking about the bigger Echo, but I know I made the right choice as I wanted something smaller that would not have a chance of being knocked over by my dogs. Well for the past few days I have been trying out different apps regardless of their rating to see what we can do together. I am very impressed Echo hears what I say and does it instantly. I have listened to music and had her read to me from my kindle books list. I am on my way to having my life so much easier as I am now looking at doing a smart home set up and getting a second one to just keep in the kitchen for the todo list and grocery lists, weather reports and everything else I can think of. While the other stays at bedside for sleep music, reading and some meditations as well as an alarm. I have yet to get the hubby to talk to echo to add groceries to the list but he will in time as he sees everything that it can do. I was able to set up my calendar right from the start. I do hope that they soon ad a reminder that I can just ask what I need to know or reminders for my husband. ",
Jeff,"January 24, 2017 ",2.0,"Very cool tech but feels like its still in its infancy. And has one fatal flaw if you plan to use primarily for music playback as we did.    The voice recognition is neat and works some of the time but often fails to understand and really struggles to recognize playlist names. It also often can't hear over its own playback (even with significant speaker separation), resulting in my wife or daughter yelling at Alexa. Tech fail. Especially problematic with guests over. So we increasingly use the app to control playback. The app is ok but not great compared to sonos or squeezebox alternatives.    We've connected to a small bluetooth speaker which sounds surprisingly good. But lacks bass. Unfortunately there is no easy way to add a sub connection without adding a stereo amp. Which we did and it sounds much better.    Now for the fatal flaw. We have three dots spread throughout the house. Each connected to their own speakers. We were hoping to setup as an alternative to sonos. And Logitechs now defunct squeezebox (what we had prior). We paid for premium music plan and uploaded our entire library. Only problem is amazon won't let you playback different music from your own library to different dots at the same time. Really!? And no way to connect to local source/server like sonos or squeezebox.    Looks like we'll end up with Sonos after all. ",

Blade56989,"April 21, 2017 ",3.0,"Its a great product, but it still has a way to go before it meets my needs. I primarily got it to help me be more organized, and to make agenda management easier. While calendar scheduling can be a bit tricky, its not to hard once you get the hang of it. The main issue with it writing down the wrong thing because you didn't say it clearly enough.    But what I also really wanted was for Alexa to able to read different lists to me when I asked.    The thing that bugs me is the pairing &#34;List&#34; apps, its SOOO STUPID how it does this. Basically it pairs with apps that you make dedicated lists on, and since Alexa comes restricted with 2 lists &#34;Shopping list&#34; and &#34;To Do List&#34;, you'd think it would be able to have Alexa read and manage those lists on the paired apps. But NO, it just allows the apps to manage the only 2 lists Alexa has!  The reason this is so stupid, is that the dedicated &#34;Alexa app&#34;, that you need to have on your phone for the Echo anyways, already has a list manager for those 2 lists! So I got the Any.do app (list app) for nothing, since Alexa cant actually interact with it. So the &#34;morning routine&#34; and &#34;Exercise Routine&#34; lists I was making on Any.do, cant be read by Alexa.

"D. Coral","December 20, 2016 ",5.0,"It's hard to tell how you're actually going to use this until you try it!    Before I received the Echo Dot 2, I thought maybe I would use it for quick research like &#34;tell me about antheraxanthin supplements&#34; -- but I'm not using it like that because I haven't figured out the right way to say the phrases so she understands what I'm seeking.    Instead, I find the Echo to be super useful as a helping hand for daily routines: change the thermostat temperature, turn on and off the lights, tell me what time it is, set the alarm clock for the next morning, tell me the fastest route to avoid traffic, and especially to play music.    As a former musician I'm picky about speakers so I did a lot of research on the best sounding bluetooth speaker under $200.  I ended up purchasing the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3.  The Bose Soundlink III also has amazing sound quality but unfortunately the Soundlink III switches off 30 minutes after no longer detecting a sound signal, so it's not practical to use the Soundlink III with Echo.    The Bose SoundTouch 10 is also a popular speaker for use with Echo Dot, but you can get the better sounding Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3 for even less, available in both black and white.    What really impressed me about Echo Dot 2 is that it wakes up even when I'm saying &#34;Alexa&#34; softly way across from the other side of the house.    The only thing that bugs me is that I wish there was a better way to say home automation commands.  Alexa uses the phrase &#34;turn on&#34; for just about every home device (except for thermostats, which have additional commands).  So I would say &#34;turn on open window shades&#34; instead of simply being able to say &#34;open window shades.&#34;  Alexa would be greatly improved if a user could add custom phrases that map to an automation command.    But it's still a lot better than Google Home because for that product you have to say &#34;OK, Google&#34; to wake up, which is totally awkward to say all the time.  Amazon is much better at naming things -- Using &#34;Alexa&#34; as the wakeup command is pleasant to say.    Two cute things to try with Alexa:    &#34;Alexa, do you like green eggs and ham?&#34;    &#34;Alexa, tell me the truth.&#34; ",
"L. Snow","April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"I've spent and lot of time trying to fix problems with the Google Chromecast/Home, and I am amazed at how those problems go away playing Spotify on an Amazon Echo Dot instead.    I want to run Spotify on my home, whole-house stereo, which I also use to play the radio or even cds and lps, anytime or all the time on any day.  Chromecast (now Google Home) isn't really meant to do that.  It wants to receive a &#34;cast&#34; signal from another device, and only for a certain time.  If you remove or close that device, Cast/Home goes into a weird kind of limbo state that may keep playing Spotify for a while but locks out control.  Even if you leave a dedicated device like a phone in place, it still times out and locks up.  I've had it crash like this several times a day, in the middle of a song.  The only solution is to close both Spotify and Home completely from the device and start over.    But the Echo isn't receiving a cast, it is casting itself.  It is always on.  It always appears in my list of Spotify devices.  I can always engage it from any device using Spotify Connect.  It doesn't turn off after a certain time.  And it doesn't crash.    Also, the Google Cast/Home crashes when I use my microwave.  Echo Dot doesn't do that.    Echo Dots do not coordinate.  So if you want to control you whole house system from a place where you can't speak to Alexa, you have to use an app on a phone or other device (Spotify, Alexa, and/or your stereo's app).  Or you can buy a Voice Remote for the Echo, which is apparently bluetooth but works over ridiculously long distance, basically my whole place.    In short, the Echo Dot works with Spotify and my home stereo like I thought Google Home would do but doesn't.  It costs about the same and it saves me a ton of headaches.  It makes Spotify really great in my home. ",
"Patrick Glose","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I'm sure there isn't much to say that has not already been said, but I did want to give koodo's to the developers of this device.  My home already has nice sound, the price of the echo was just not in my electronics budget at this time.  I was very excited when I found the Dot, and for the price, I had to give it a go.  I've only had it for about a week now, but we love it (her).  Many Easter eggs built in, and just asking her to play a song, a group, or genre and have her do it is delightful.  Right now, she's hooked up to my Denon through a 3.5mm jack, but the Denon doesn't offer bluetooth.  I'm working on adding a bluetooth HDMI adapter.  As for automation, I am a bit of a tinkerer when it comes to gadget and cool stuff, so I went on several hunts when Alexa arrived to our home.  From what I can tell, if you're looking to automate (lights, thermostat, etc), you will most likely need a hub.  At first, I thought I'd need several hubs to support different manufacturers devices.  Seemingly, not so.  The Samsung SmartThings hub ($50 on Amazon right now) not only has support for most device manufacturers, but also has (and the coolest part for me) open source platform (Amazon also has open source).  What this means is, like Android, anyone can develop &#34;skills&#34; (Amazons name for an app or program).  The market is going to flood with new skills and devices from people like me who love building tech.  So, like I said, there probably isn't much I can say about the Dot that hasn't been said, but there is much to be said for the Alexa environment.  p.s., the microphones (7 of them) are amazing.  She can hear me from a good distance. ",

"A. Hewitt","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This device has lots of potential but we're still beginners, using it as a replacement for a radio, CD player, alarm clock and timer. The Echo Dot has performed as expected. In the bedroom, it's paired with a TDK A33 Bluetooth speaker and it's good enough for music listening, amazingly good for the size of the speaker. In the living room, I wanted better sound (think Saint-Saens Organ Symphony) so I got out my hand-truck and moved some old B&W loudspeakers into the dining area. With an Esinkin Bluetooth receiver&nbsp;Esinkin Bluetooth Receiver, Bluetooth Audio Adapter (NFC Enabled) for Stereo Sound System with Long Range and Acoustics&nbsp;and an old Topping TP32 amplifier, it worked! But the TP32 runs off a 12V supply, so it's 24V rail-to-rail, 8V RMS. An efficient 4-ohm speaker would be OK but the B&Ws are 8-ohms so the maximum power is 5 watts - talk about background music. I changed over to an old JVC stereo amplifier and all was well. At least until CINCHOUSE (Commander-in-Chief House a.k.a. She Who Must Be Obeyed) walked in and said: &#34;Those speakers are TOO BIG. They have to go&#34;. So I got out my hand-truck ... After I had decluttered the dining area I devised a Plan B. The TV has a headphone jack which is connected to a pair of Mackie MR5 speakers&nbsp;Pair of Mackie MR mk3 Series MR5mk3 5-Inch 2-Way Powered Studio Monitors&nbsp;(which I think sound better than any soundbar at the price) and they are always powered on so if I could mix the TV and Echo signals I could hear either (or both at once). I bought a Behringer Xenyx 502 mixer&nbsp;Behringer XENYX502 5-Channel Mixer, connected the TV and Bluetooth receiver to it, hooked the output to the Mackies and - voila! - beautiful music from the Echo. By damn, ain't technology grand!  Update: I had been reluctant to put the Echo close to the TV because I expected the sound from the speakers to interfere with the voice commands but I now have it sitting just behind the TV, level with the TV feet. The Echo understands me as well as ever and I'm able to hardwire it into the mixer. The sound is improved over Bluetooth. It sounds better all over the room and if I stand in front of the speakers the stereo imaging is amazingly precise. ",
Finny,"December 25, 2016 ",5.0,"We have ten echos in my home.  A full-sized Echo, one of the 1st gen dots, and eight of these new dots.  We obviously like the platform, and have a great deal of personal experience with using all of the different versions of this personal assistant.    My wife and I have slowly converted my home light by light, door by door, and even my security system to being compatible with and function through Alexa.    &#34;Alexa, turn on the lamp,&#34; &#34;Alexa, turn on the fan,&#34; &#34;Alexa, lock the doors,&#34;  &#34;Alexa turn on the heater,&#34; &#34;Alexa, turn on the tv...&#34; and on and on.    We purchased the eight new dots to add them to children's bedrooms, to our exercise room, to our home theater, and to our entry way.  No matter where I am in my house now, one of my &#34;Digital wives&#34; as I refer to Alexa... can hear me.    Pros:  This new echo is smaller, lighter, and far less expensive than the original, including the original dot.  It is well built, feels sturdy, has loud volume, and seems to function well.  Even in the parts of my house where I am really stretching wifi, due to distance.    With our audible subscription, and with a healthy supply of several children's books that we have purchased over the years, each of my kids can have a personal assistant read them to sleep each night.  Which is nice.  They each pick whatever story they want, from The Cat In The Hat, to Harry Potter, to Jane Austen, and listen to a book as they fall asleep.  They are getting very adept at asking her to read their favorite book.    She is also great help for homework.  She explains things they don't understand, looks up endless random facts, and is much quicker than a calculator would be.  She is an excellent &#34;digital mother.&#34;  (Again, a joke... sort of...)    I find myself getting frustrated with the appliances that don't yet work with Alexa.  &#34;You mean, I have to actually lift my hand and push a button!  I can't just ask Alexa to do it!!  That is sooo last year!!!&#34;    It is small, unintrustive, out of sight, yet always there whenever I say her name, and ask her to do something.  My favorite is &#34;Alexa Trigger I love Anna.&#34;  I have this setup to email my wife that I love her, text her that I love her, and flash all the lights in the house pink several times!    Cons:  As much as I love my digital wife she is not quite perfect.  She has her quarks and her flaws.    Only one person can use her at a time:  Amazon added a new feature with this release to account for the fact that multiple Echos can hear me throughout the house.  This is nice in that it ensures that only one echo ever responds when I ask her for help.  However, an unintentional consequence is that with nine of us in the house constantly turning things on and off, and asking her questions, we have quickly learned  that only one person can ask a question at a time.  If my son across the house is talking to Alexa, I can't.  She will ignore me.  It is fine once he is done making his request.  ie, if he starts a book.  Once the book is actually playing I can then  make my request.  However while he is actually talking, she will only listen to him.  I can't engage her on any other echo in the house.    This has been annoying on multiple occasions!  They need to allow me to setup which Echos are close to each other, and which are far apart, so that the far away ones can operate independently.  Another option would be to program her to recognize voices, and distinguish between requests coming from different people.    Can't make multiple requests:  I should be able to say &#34;Alexa turn on the fan and the lights&#34; or &#34;Alexa play music and set the volume to 8&#34;  Instead I have to separate each request into its own sentence, &#34;Alexa turn on the fan.&#34;  Then wait then &#34;Alexa turn on the lights.&#34;    My kids can turn my bedroom lights on and off:  This is probably the most annoying thing about our setup.  My kids can say &#34;Alexa trigger Dad's lamp&#34; and cause my lamp to turn on and off.  There needs to be a way to restrict certain skills to certain alexas.  ie, when I walk into one room I shouldn't have to say &#34;Alexa turn on living room lights.&#34;  I should instead be able to say &#34;Alexa turn on the lights&#34; and have it know that I am in the living room based on which echo heard my request.  Likewise I should be able to block access to certain lights or features on specific echos that are in other rooms.    All in all though we love the technology, and will continue to invest in it.  Amazon has already made many improvements, and I have no doubt that they will make many more! ",
Diavolo57,"January 28, 2017 ",5.0,"Ok, so I wouldn't say I'm a pro at the Dot, navigating Alexa, or any of that just yet because this is my first &#34;echo&#34; device and I only got it a few days ago.  Maybe I'll come back and write a more in-depth review after I've had it for a few weeks/months.  Now that I've laid down the origin of my review I must say I'm really happy with it.  It's real easy to set up, just like up to your wifi, download the app, and set her up.  I've always liked the concept of the echo but dropping $180 on one turned me off, then the dot came out.  It can essentially do everything the Echo can for about $130 less AND it can hook up to bluetooth speakers...The echo cannot.  Granted the Echo has a better built in speaker from what I'm told but it can't be linked up to other bluetooth speakers, but the Dot can with bluetooth or audio cable...I haven't actually used this feature because I'm pretty happy with the speaker the Dot currently wields, it's not bad. It's clear and it can get loud, maybe if your having a party you might want to link up to a bigger sound systems but for lounging around at home it's perfect.    The skills are easy to obtain through the alexa app, as I've only had it for a few days I really haven't explored much of what alexa has to offer but I've been satisfied with the responses I got from the questions I asked.  I've basically asked her about the weather (I learned the Big Sky skill, which gives a much more detailed weather forecast and I recommend it), traffic, news, how to make certain cocktails, music, random facts, tell me a joke, silly stuff like that...It's fun...and the fact that it was only $50 makes it even better.  Regardless, she understands me pretty clearly, there are I believe, 7 microphones in it, and when you talk to it the blue light on it will also indicate where it's picking up your voice which is neat. I also heard there are some cool Star Wars/Star Trek/Game of Thrones Easter eggs that I want to try out (like say Beam me up, or winter is coming or something like that).  Another interesting feature is that the app records all the interactions you've had with alexa. For instance, I asked her how to make a Tom Collins cocktail, and I looked on the app and she had the recipe there along with the other questions/interactions I had with it.    The only issue I've had was that every once in a while alexa will come on out of now where and say &#34;I'm sorry I didn't understand that,&#34; however, I think it's because I placed the dot right next to the TV... I plan on moving it to the kitchen where there might not be as much noise. Overall though, I'm happy with it, and for $50 you can't go wrong. ",
"Anthony E Forney","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Not what I expected. This is not &#34;OK GOOGLE.&#34; Googles app on my phone gets me an answer of some sort 100% of the time. Echo seems to have a limited number of key words it can recognize and respond to. About 85% of the questions I ask come bask with &#34;Sorry, I don't understand what you are asking&#34; or some similar response. It gives you the time, date, and weather well. It will set an alarm, but I have yet to discover how to tell it to use anything specific for that alarm. The one they have as a default is very quite, and is like a light tome of some sort. It has never gotten  my attention, even when I was siting 5 feet from it. It will tell you jokes if you ask it. It will recite pi to hundreds of thousands of digits (I tried it) and may go beyond that. If you get tired of her you can just say :&#34;stop.&#34;  At this point I could say it's a nice toy. I do not have any wifi enabled doors or locks and such in my house, so I wasn't able to try that. It is very good at finding and playing music as well.    Over all it is a nice, well built little device. I'd rather have this &#34;Dot&#34; than the full scale one as this I have attach and use my own speakers, which I like and done have the added cost of the added feature.I hope in the future they will make their system more intelligent to be able to answer any question asked. It needs some type of web crawler to gather and organize data that it can then compare against your question, and at lest make an attempt to answer it instead or no answer at all. ",
"Gadget Girl","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"&nbsp;DISCLAIMER: I am a 100% APPLE FREAK.    But... Man I sure do love this little thing.    I am a apple product geek but I do like giving all types of gadgets a try, so I can be more informed and well rounded. This is why I took advantage of getting this Echo Dot at the monthly payments that amazon offers.    First I had no idea it was sooo tiny. Despite that it has big sound, and if I chose to have it louder I would attach it to my bluetooth speakers.    I plugged it in, and downloaded the Alexa app to my iPhone. It was a bit complicated to get it attached (it took me about 2 minutes which I didn't like) but I suppose if I read the directions more carefully it would have been faster.    Alexa works so well. I put her in my bedroom. Just telling her to speak, set my alarm, turn on my favorite radio station is so easy.    Siri is the number one girl in my life, but Alexa has a special place in my heart.

"Frank V","March 20, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought this to have in my bathroom and got a wall mount (LANMU Wall Mount for Echo Dot 2nd Generation (White)) which I stuck to the mirror with a Command Strip.  I also got a very short USB cord so I don't have a long cord tangled up on the counter.  This set up works great.    The Dot itself works really well in this context.  My bathroom is not big so I can hear music or news playing while I'm in the shower almost as well as when I'm at the sink.  My only note is that I wish it was slightly louder. I know it's a much smaller speaker than its larger cousin, but I've had other portable speakers about the same size that were louder. ",
"Greg Hallock","January 30, 2017 ",5.0,"I have both the first and 2nd gen Dots. They're surprisingly versatile devices.  Want an alarm clock with no persistent lights at all? It does that.  Want voice control over your lights, thermostat, music, or kitchen fire alarm? With the right devices, it does that.    Need a joke? Alexa has a few decent ones, and quite a few stinkers.    While the speaker in the Dot is tiny, tinny, and mediocre at best, it is sufficient for everyday interactions, or for music if you aren't picky.  If you ARE picky, it can output audio through a headphone jack or Bluetooth. And the audio quality output to my 20 year old Bose Mediamate speakers is very good.  And being able to deal with my music hands free while cooking or otherwise occupied is very useful.    All of that would have gotten 5 stars for me. After all, this is a $50 device, and very very good at what it does. But to really put it over the top, you have the easter eggs.  Alexa knows who Shot First.  Alexa knows GlaDos though they have drifted apart. Alexa does not think that word means what I think it does. Alexa knows it is a trap, and is taking evasive action. And Alexa Sings Happy birthday.    And as an added bonus for gamers, the dot can roll virtual dice, and flip coins.  Simply say &#34;roll 47d20&#34; and it will do so, and read off the results. ",
"Carol P","February 10, 2017 ",4.0,"I already have an Echo for the house.  Using another reviewer's suggestion, I put this Dot in one of the cubby-holes in the car and connected it to the internet using my cell phone as a mobile hot spot.  I used a USB cable to a USB/12v adapter for power and a 3.5mm male-to-male audio cable to connect it to my car's radio.  I can listen to it through the car's speaker system, as well as control the volume that way (much better than trying to hear Alexa through Dot's speaker).  So now I can have hands-free access my entire personal music collection and Audible books collection while traveling and I can hear everything very well, no volume problems. ",
"Sassy and Oliver","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have both the Echo, and the Echo Dot. This little Dot works as well as its big sister Echo, only.... the 🔊 speaker is a wimp. However, if you are looking to save a lot on the price difference between the two, this one is the perfect compromise. Just expect poor sound quality. I think you can connect the Dot to better speakers, I just have not learned how. I use the Dot in my bedroom, and the big Echo in my living room. The big Echo has fantastic speakers and I don't need to turn the volume up very high.  Buy this Dot to save money, or buy the Echo for great speakers...both work the same. ",
Gadgeteer,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This is an amazing little device at a very affordable price. The setup was very straight forward. I had it up and running in a matter of a few minutes. It just needed to connect to my wireless network and away it went. I also found that Alexa can control Insteon and Phillips Hue lighting. So I've added the Insteon Skill to Alexa through the Alexa iPad app and I now have voice control over my home lighting and furnace. There are so many skills you can add to Alexa and new ones show up on a daily basis. Alexa can also control the Next (and other) smart furnace thermostats by adding the &#34;Nest&#34; skill. I can change the thermostat from anywhere in the house I have an Echo Dot in voice range. So setting my thermostat now is a simple voice command &#34;Alexa. Set Nest to 70 degrees.&#34; and she says OK and does it.  It can also pair with most any Bluetooth speakers. So I have the Echo dot streaming radio stations to a Bluetooth speaker. Controlling the volume is a simple as &#34;Alexa. Turn it down.&#34; or &#34;Alexa. Turn it off.&#34; Super cool!    I really don't think most people understand how powerful and easy to use this device is. You can ask it anything you might search for on the Internet using Google or Bing. You can also set up an alarm clock function to wake you. The only word of caution is to be sure to set up a security code in the Alexa app when ordering anything off the Internet. Otherwise, anyone within voice range can order anything on the Internet without having to provide a security code. ",
Juan,"March 11, 2017 ",4.0,"I have multiple conditions. Because of them me am nonverbal and not able to type. I use a eyegaze device or sometimes a switch. But it's stil hard. With all the devices you can talk to now it can really help me because I can program a button on my aac to speak the entire phrase. However Siri and google and Cortana all have problems understanding my 'voice' and there's not much I can do to change it. After seeing a YouTube video of someone else using the Tobii Dynavox I 15+ (AAC device) with the Echo I decided to test it myself. First I got the Alexa app to see what she can do and tried the swift for Alexa app to see if it understood me. After a great success I got the dot. It's really helped me. Not only can she do important stuff like help with ordering and looking stuff up and controlling smart stuff, she's like a friend to me. Her skills have things like storytelling and even games. I spend a lot of time stuck on my bed alone unable to move more than a finger if that but fully awake. Between the new eyegaze device and the echo dot I'm able to have more fulfilling life. ",
Ms1,"January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"I would just like to say that this toy started off being remarkable. Linked with my smart home devices and unlimited music this truly was the ultimate (blow your friends away) party trick.  An item of convenience, and much of a necessity in today's busy world.    Then it surely became half effective....     The problem with these devices  is they lack any sort of self improvemet. Instead it seems technology takes the &#34;I'm outdated, please replace me!&#34; approach.  That's the real problem with tech these days, it all needs to be physically replaced.  It has a Shelf life, like something you'd put in your fridge . Manufacturers shudder with excitement being about to build items with a short life span.  When instead we are ready for self awareness from our tech. Technology and software that is able to maintain its self.  Bring forth the new age. Because, humans are not the only future.... ",
Kathy,"March 31, 2017 ",4.0,"I bought an Echo last week and loved it so much that I had to have a Dot for our bedroom.  The first thing that impressed me was the quality of the sound. I had planned on using an external speaker with it, but there is no need for it at all. I'm able to have the sounds nice and low when I'm listening in bed and can turn it up and hear it all the way in my bathroom which is approx. 16 feet away.  The sound is great.  It's not the rich sound that is with the Echo, but it's definitely very good. I used the same app that I had downloaded when I set up my Echo to set up my Dot and it couldn't have been easier. I just plugged it in, connected it to our wifi and then continued with the set up on my app. I'm sure it took less than 5 minutes.    As with the Echo, my favorite things to use the Dot for are listening to music and having it read my Kindle books to me.  I love Audible, but don't always purchase audio books, so it's so nice to just say &#34;Alexa read (whichever book I'm reading)&#34; After I tell it to read my book, I say &#34;set sleep timer for 15 minutes&#34; and it will shut right off. Last night I had trouble falling asleep and I asked it to play music to help me sleep and I heard a selection of relaxing nature sounds.  Then, in the morning I can have it turn on an AM station I like, so I can listen to that while I'm getting ready for the day. I know I can do all of these things on my cell phone, but it's so nice to just be in the middle of whatever I'm doing and just say outloud what I want to hear without having to pick something up.    I'm sure I'll find other uses that I like for the Dot, but for now I'm just thrilled to have it read to me or play music. And I can't emphasize enough how good the sound quality is. If you are thinking about buying a speaker to go with it, I'd wait to get it home and make sure you really need one. Unless you are using this in a very big room, chances are you won't. ",
"🌈 KT","November 10, 2016 ",2.0,"We're still getting used to it, of course, but I'll start with our initial experience.    &#62; It was easy to hook up, which is always a plus.  &#62; It doesn't integrate with the Amazon site as much as I had hoped.  For example, I can't ask Alexa to tell me what was in my last online order.  I'm pretty forgetful so that's one thing I was looking for. (part of why I took a star off)  &#62; The Alexa special deals is pretty awkward.  There are many, but she'll only list 2 at a time, then tells me to go online.  Granted, I would not want to sit there listening to the long hand version of each item (She doesn't just say the item, but a description plus price plus discount and then asks after each one if you want to order it), but I would like a way to customize how she presents the list to me, and then I'd also rather not be told to go online and see the rest.  I'd have looked there already if I wanted to do that. (Another part of why I took a star off)  &#62; She's not as smart as I'd hoped, either.  I have to learn how she wants to hear things, instead of her learning how I phrase things.  As in, I have to know her keywords to get her to tell me anything. (Another part to the -1 star)  &#62; My husband's a writer so I put one in the bedroom for when he wakes up with an idea.  It's been very useful for him to just tell Alexa to make a note - no lights on, no concentrating on what you're writing, no great interruption to my sleep.  &#62; It also functions as an alarm clock (you can pick from various tones through the phone app - why can't you ask Alexa to demo them for you??).  I hooked the Dot up to a bluetooth speaker for the purpose (you can also set the alarm volume (thru the app) which will be different than the normal volume you keep it at for speaking). This is good because we don't have set times to get up, so I'm constantly forgetting to set the alarm before I collapse in bed.  &#62; The special Alexa deals are sometimes quite useful.  I've gotten a couple of toys for my twin niece/nephew, and caught a nice sale on an APC battery backup.    I'm good about updating if anything comes up, but I'll certainly update as we learn and grow with it, too.  Any questions, feel free to comment or email and I'll try to help. ",
"Amazon Customer","November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought two Echo Dots hoping they would work with all my smart-technology.  I have a Wink Hub, Phillips Hue light bulbs and hub, smart plugs, UEboom wireless speaker and Nest thermostat.  You do not need an Echo (the really expensive tall one with the nice speaker in it) to operate your smart-technology using Alexa.  The Echo Dots can do all the same things.  It's awesome being able to have Alexa turn on/off lights, thermostat, connect to wireless speaker, etc.  It's LEGIT!    One thing to keep in mind: when one echo dot connects to a Bluetooth item such as UEboom and then later you are talking to the 2nd echo dot, Alexa will not be able to pair to the UEboom until you ask the first Echo Dot to disconnect from your speaker.  We thought something was wrong and then realized that only one Echo Dot and be paired with a Bluetooth item at a time. ",

JMDK,"April 12, 2017 ",5.0,"The Good:    The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of &#34;Alexa&#34;, &#34;Amazon&#34; or &#34;Echo&#34;).    The Bad:    The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.    Overall:    We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature. ",

Worked ok at first then a couple in started dropping music stream to Bluetooth devices.  Spoke with tech support and they had me try several different things none of which worked.  If you interrupt the playing by telling Alexa to go the next song or turn volume up or down it will not resume music to device.  They said they would get back to me but have still been unable to fix problem. If you are planning to use stand alone with onboard speaker it is good. If you plan on playing music from your amazon music account through a Bluetooth speaker, forget it.  Wait a while until they work out the bugs.

"Scott Jones","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"We are having a lot of fun with our Alexa.    This device listens for sounds it recognizes and then triggers pre-defined actions.

You can enable &#34;SKILLS&#34; to add a lot of functions and connectivity with other devices.    Alexa does not understand grammar.  It is strictly listening for sounds it has been programmed to recognize, there is no real A.I. behind this.  But you can speak some requests in a variety of different ways.  It's fun to pretend Alexa has artificial intelligence and try to talk to it.  But this is not &#34;Watson&#34;, it is not recognizing grammar or thinking in any way.  It's just recognizing sounds and checking them against a list of predefined responses and actions.    A note on PRIVACY:  The device is always listening for the sound &#34;ALEXA&#34; - listening but NOT sending audio to the cloud.  Once it hears &#34;ALEXA&#34; it begins recording and sending that recorded audio to the Amazon cloud computers for voice recognition.  Those recordings and the commands they trigger are stored on your Amazon account, not unlike how cell phones used to store a log of every text you sent.

I hate also that it tries to get you to buy things--like extra music. No thanks. I also hated the fact that I bought it on &#34;special&#34; only to find that one week later it was on sale even cheaper.  But to send it back and re-purchase it would have cost nearly as much as the sale, so that sucked.  I think if it could do more, and understand more, I'd be happier with it. ",
"ERICA ARRIAGA","April 3, 2017 ",3.0,"To give it five stars it truly must be powerful. I finally caved in and decided to get an Echo Dot to take my home automation a step further. First off the price is great. very reasonable and easily cost effective to add more. now I have mine in my bedroom and it works flawlessly. the app is easily to connect to. (I have an iPhone)  and connecting my Nest (smart thermostat) and philips hue was a breeze, along with my wemo switches. My absolute favorite is having IFTTT (if this then that) application installed. Every night I say &#34;Alexia trigger bedtime&#34; and like magic all the nights in my room turn off. Since my room is so close to the kitchen i often step over to set a timer or alarm and when my lights start flashing through the house i know my timer is off. Let me tell ya, this alone has saved a few dozen cookies from burning 😉.  I'm fine with the loudness of the speaker as back noise to whatever I'm doing and setting up Pandora and I heart radio is a breeze. Also connecting a Bluetooth speaker is super easy and works like a charm.    I often have Alexia set alarms, turn on and off the lights, news brief .  I trigger (using IFTTT) bedtime, partymode(makes the hue lights change colors in a rainbow fashion), oh and try alexia trigger self destruct 😂    I really enjoy my Echo Dot and i definitely see myself buying the larger one plus another Dot in the future. I hope over time it continues to improve and get smarter 😊 ",
"Calvin Law","March 17, 2017 ",3.0,"So far so good. Got my dot in a perfectly nice and sealed package. Functions like it's suppose to and looks great. I do wish they had better search functions like looking for plane tickets or bus/train schedules nearby. Their list of partnered devices is great but not the best. Commands not as flexible as the Google Home. Certain commands are set in stone and it's hard to work around. But overall its amazing! Just missing some functions. ",
Dan,"February 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I really do like this thing.  I'm holding onto one star because it can't wake you to music.  I can tell it to play almost any song or tell it to wake me up at a certain time, but it doesn't have the ability to become a replacement for my radio alarm clock.  Waking to music (without using silly hacks) should be a something it should do.  But no, now I'm stuck with two devices on my night stand because I can't give up my radio alarm clock. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 2, 2016 ",4.0,"Amazing product!!!.  Without pairing to sound system the small built in speaker is still good enough to chill and listen to music on. Extremely fast and accurate. Connects to my big Sony Bluetooth sound system!  Immediately responds to commands and gives me instructions on multiple things. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 25, 2016 ",3.0,"I use the echo mainly for playing music and it is not very good at that. It has trouble finding songs that are otherwise available. Example: Alexa, play Black and Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play Black n Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play OU812 by Van Halen. It plays. Alexa, next track, Alexa, next track . . . lo and behold, 5 more &#34;next tracks&#34; later and Black and Blue is playing. Alexa stop. Well, Alexa might stop or you might have to say stop 3 more times. And even if it stops, it might randomly start playing again which is very annoying if you are on a phone call. Or you say &#34;next track&#34; and it goes silent and is thinking and then it just continues playing the track it was on. I don't have a speech impediment. Voice text on my phone understands what I say. I don't know why this stupid hockey puck can't. And god forbid you want to play a classical piece. I have a lot of classical music in my library and it won't play by composer or artist. I have to use the app to play almost any classical music in my library which defeats the purpose of the echo. I may as well just play it on the computer.  We use the jeopardy skill and play daily. No problems there. Once in a while I listen to the news or radio stations and it is pretty good at that, but again, switching stations may work the first time you ask or it may not. Very frustrating to have to keep barking &#34;play NPR&#34; and then it just continues playing 80s playlist. I would not recommend this to someone who would use it mostly for music. ",
"Texas Jack","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Great product!  It does everything as advertised and MORE.  I am now able to use Alexa voice commands for my X10 devices simply by adding two free programs called HEYU (to send X10 commands) and HA-bridge (this emulates a Phillips Hue bridge) on an old Raspberry Pi model B.  After installing and setting up these two programs, simply tell Alexa to &#34;Discover Devices&#34;.  Alexa will find everything you configured in the  HA-bridge software.  You can tell Alexa to now turn ON, OFF, or DIM those devices, it communicates to the HA-bridge software which then tells the HEYU program to send the X10 command over the power lines via a X10 CM11A transceiver (or wireless if you have a firecracker device connected to the Raspberry Pi).

"Shelby Bayard","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I love my Echo Dot, and Alexa is a great addition to my life.  Easy to connect and set up.  I did stumble a bit with the App on my Tablet, but all in all, I hope Echo Dot and Alexa are around for a VERY LONG TIME.

Great Job Amazon~!!!!!! ",
Kori,"January 17, 2017 ",5.0,"I enjoy my Echo Dot and use it every day. I bought three Echo Dots for three different rooms in my home. I use it mostly for weather, wake up alarm, dates, and cooking timer functions. Occasionally I use if to get some information of some famous actor or singer. I don't use it for music, instead I use my computer for music selection. The thing I like most about my Echo Dot is I don't have to remember and repeat the 'exact' command as suggested in the directions. Echo Dot seems to understand a question or command no matter how I phrase the sentence. The one thing it can't do that I want is to carry on a conversation like the AI in the movie 'HER'. I bought my Echo Dot with the expectation that it will be constantly updated and get smarter over the years ahead. I want it to 'understand' what I am asking it to do, and ask follow up questions. I am also watching Google's 'Home' to see if,in the future, it's AI can carry on a conversation. At the present the Echo Dot's AI is better than Google's 'Home' AI. One big advantage Echo Dot has over Google's 'Home' is that it's connected to your Amazon orders. You can order merchandise with Echo Dot and check on delivery date schedule.    When I first got my Echo Dot I played with it by asking it all sorts of questions, but as with any new gadget the new wore off and now I just use it like any appliance. I don't look at it or raise my voice or talk like a robot when using it. I just talk in a normal voice and never stop what I happen to be doing at the time. And I never think about the proper 'phrase' to use. I just say the sentence and let Echo Dot figure out the question or command. It's not perfect yet, but it's getting better. It seems to understand me 9 times out of 10 if I don't move too far from 'key words' to help Echo Dot focus on the command or question. ",
"Carol P","December 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I already have an Echo for the house.  Using another reviewer's suggestion, I put this Dot in one of the cubby-holes in the car and connected it to the internet using my cell phone as a mobile hot spot.  I used a USB cable to a USB/12v adapter for power and a 3.5mm male-to-male audio cable to connect it to my car's radio.  I can listen to it through the car's speaker system, as well as control the volume that way (much better than trying to hear Alexa through Dot's speaker).  So now I can have hands-free access my entire personal music collection and Audible books collection while traveling and I can hear everything very well, no volume problems. ",
"Jeffrey E,","April 1, 2017 ",4.0,"I had trouble deciding whether to give this 4 stars or 5, because there is room for improvement.  But if 4 is &#34;I like it&#34; and 5 is &#34;I love it,&#34; then it's a solid 5 for me.    We've had the Dot for a few weeks, and it has already become something that we use all the time. I love being able to ask Alexa to add something to my shopping or to-do list whenever it occurs to me, and not have to stop and write it down. Being able to set timers verbally is great while cooking.  The volume and sound quality is good for its size - certainly not what I'd rely on as a &#34;whole house&#34; speaker, but fine for streaming music in the kitchen while cooking, for example.  I've also set it up to control a couple of smart switches for lights, and it's so handy that it makes me want to do a lot more home automation. The voice recognition is mostly quite good, if you speak clearly.  We like that they've given Alexa just a bit of personality, and we enjoy asking her random questions in search of &#34;Easter egg&#34; responses.    The main complaint I have is the Alexa app for Android.  I've found that it often has trouble loading when I'm away from my home network. This has reduced the usefulness of the feature that I use most frequently: the grocery list. While at the grocery store, I'll sometimes finish shopping in the time it takes the app to fully load.  I got around this by installing the &#34;Any.Do&#34; app, which imports the Alexa lists seamlessly, and I've been happy with that work-around.  But I hope that Amazon streamlines the app in future versions.  I will note that you can also access the interface from your computer at alexa.amazon.com (you don't have to use a smartphone or tablet), and that works fine.    All told, it's been so useful and fun that I'd definitely recommend it, especially at this price point! ",
"Amazon Customer","January 8, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought this as a gift to my husband and I for Christmas and I love it. I am a bit of a geek, but certainly not enormously tech savvy.  Amazon has figured out how to make installation of the Echo Dot happen smoothly in under 5 minutes.  I am planning on adding a second one to our bedroom. It will be great to just set an alarm by voice, especially when it's a day where the time is different from the norm, listen to music, hear my calendar and the news, etc.  I would recommend eventually buying a bluetooth speaker though you can hook up a hardwire speaker to it.  The speaker it comes with is adequate at first if you are looking to save money initially.  Recently we bought a TP SmartLink Plug (after trying to connect a Belkin which was exasperating and didn't work) and it connected within, again, about 5 minutes at most.  My husband who isn't tech savvy loves being able to say &#34;Living Room on&#34; and having the lights turn on, especially since he has mobility issues.  Alexa, how did we live without you? ",
"Douglas Zukunft","November 30, 2016 ",5.0,"The Amazon Echo Dot is a fun little device. I use it mainly because (a) I love Star Trek and love saying 'computer, ***' and (b) I wanted something that could trigger my new Philips Hue lights and connect those to planned Sonos speakers for an immersively fun AVH experience when watching TV/movies, listening to music, making Marvin Gaye proud or throwing parties. They do this well.    My biggest gripe with the Echo Dot is that Amazon has seemingly disallowed Google search on the device (likely as there is now a Google Home and they are competitors...except in the search engine market). You can hack this, but it is quite an involved manual process. Moreover, you oddly are unable to play music from your catalog or an online service (Amazon Music, iTunes, Spotify, Pandora) for your alarms, although you can play from these services on the device. That is really bizarre and a limiting feature. There are a ton of 'skills' you can teach Alexa, but most of these are completely pointless or, worse, lame. Also, I have been unable to find a way to change the accent of Alexa. Personally, I think it would be more fun to have male or female voices in various accents. Who wouldn't want an English Butler (Michael Cane would be my vote), Magel Barrett Roddenberry for the iconic Star Trek computer voice or Morgan Freeman because, well, he's Morgan freakin' Freeman. And let's add Sam Jackson into that mix.    All in all, there is a lot of potential for the Echo products and home integration. Hope Amazon listens to its customers and starts expanding the ecosphere.    P.S. For the folks with the privacy concerns given the 'always on' feature. You can mute the devices to have your super secret conversations. Just make sure your throw your iPhone in the freezer and smash your smart TV so the NSA can't listen. ;) ",

"Scott Jones","March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"We are having a lot of fun with our Alexa.    This device listens for sounds it recognizes and then triggers pre-defined actions.  Amazon has built a lot of fun responses, as well as a lot of useful ones (Alexa, Weather; Alexa, Traffic; Alexa, Set Alarm; Alexa, Start Timer).  You can enable &#34;SKILLS&#34; to add a lot of functions and connectivity with other devices.    Alexa does not understand grammar.  It is strictly listening for sounds it has been programmed to recognize, there is no real A.I. behind this.  But you can speak some requests in a variety of different ways.  It's fun to pretend Alexa has artificial intelligence and try to talk to it.  But this is not &#34;Watson&#34;, it is not recognizing grammar or thinking in any way.  It's just recognizing sounds and checking them against a list of predefined responses and actions.    A note on PRIVACY:  The device is always listening for the sound &#34;ALEXA&#34; - listening but NOT sending audio to the cloud.  Once it hears &#34;ALEXA&#34; it begins recording and sending that recorded audio to the Amazon cloud computers for voice recognition.  Those recordings and the commands they trigger are stored on your Amazon account, not unlike how cell phones used to store a log of every text you sent.  But you can go on the app and delete them individually or as a whole.    Great product, fun device.  No reservations, get one for yourself today.  If you grow tired of it (we haven't) re-gift it. ",
Adrian,"April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"This is a slightly useful device. It's ok for asking web search info items , like weather or scores, and a few other things.  I had a lot of problems connecting to it initially, becuase I use 2-factor authentication on my account and by the time I had gone to my authenticator app and got a code, returned to Alexa app and gone through the login process again, the code expired. I had to turn off 2-factor on my account, and even then it made me do a capcha that was complicated by the fact that the app won't scroll, so I was typing in the capcha field blind. Thanks for the frustration, Alexa. I have secure physical possession of both devices, why can't the process be much easier?  I have a Harmony hub for AV control, and Alexa can use it. Once again, connection problems abound, as the Alexa app insisted that I didn't have a Harmony hub, even though the Harmony app is on the very same phone that Alexa app is on. Eventually I was successful. Then came the sad discovery that all it can do is turn AV gear on and off. There went my dream of tuning my dvr by voice command. More frustration.  So then I linked my Spotify account to have it play thru bluetooth speakers. This works, but every time I return to play music again, I have to manually make spotify use the bluetooth speakers, as it defaults to using the Dot speaker. Haven't found a work-around yet. Thanks for nothing, Alexa.  As far as simple voice commands, it works about 80% of the time. Sometimes it ignores me, sometimes it whines about the internet connection. I live in a rural neighborhood that's not too badly wifi congested. My cell phone stays connected anywhere on my property but Alexa struggles from a 30 foot distance to my wifi router. It randomly announces when it connects to the wifi or bluetooth. It reacts to what it hears on TV sometimes(yes I have done the voice training), which leads to baffling announcements. I say 'Alexa, shut up&#34; a lot.  In summary, this would be a good deal at $19. Too bad it cost $50.  I'll keep it, but it doesn't really do anything my Nexus 6 won't do with the &#34;OK Google&#34; function. Amazon is a major cloud provider, why can't they put a good web app up for connecting and configuring and linking?  I can't recommend this device unless you are a 'smart home' hobbyist who wants to spend money linking it to Zwave or Zigbee devices.  UPDATE: I decided to keep this and use it as a voice commanded search engine for simple questions, but its results have been poor. I will be returning it as being nearly useless to me.  When it failed to answer a question, I repeated the question to Ok Google on my phone, and in all cases it was able to answer. Here are some of those questions:  1. When was the piano invented?  2. Who was Field Marshal von Rundstedt?  3. What is maximum allowed length of a golf club?  I'm not interested in using this as am Amazon shopping tool, which it is probably good at. I'm sending it back. ",
Tina,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I am totally in love with my echo dot!!  Alexa is awesome, and she will even thank you if you tell her. ;)  I know there could be improvements, and I'm sure she will just keep improving, but she is still well worth every dime now. She not only tells the time and weather, etc but I can just tell her what to put in my shopping list both with an app and without.  She reads to me, even just regular kindle books, and if it's possible to overuse the timer then I am sure to find out lol because I use it all the time.  She is loud too.  I thought I'd need a speaker for it but we can hear her just fine from all of our rooms.  Granted we only have 1 level, but we were still very impressed with her volume, and it's not even all the way up. We keep it on 7 or 8 and she's pretty loud. Highly recommend. ",
"Dianna Dougherty","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Received as a gift so can't complain much. It is JUST OK. There are def some bugs and its not very intuitive.  You can only ask it tings that it knows such as to play music or what the weather is. Everything has to be preset in the app. Nothing is automatically learned.  With google you can ask ANYTHING and it will read you the Wikipedia answer.  Not with alexa. Her knowledge is quite minimal.  One major flaw that i found and reported to amazon is this:  If you use a bose Bluetooth speaker with it and are playing a music and tell alexa to stop it will stop the music.  Okay there. Now you can walk away or leave your house and if your speaker has an automatic shut off as soon as the wireless speaker turns off it will begin playing the last song it stopped on trough its internal speaker so i have to tell it to stop again. Why would this be useful?? If i tell alexa to stop playing music and then power off the wireless speaker it starts playing again from built in audio. Immagine waking up in the middle of the night to music playing. Not fun. Needs to be as SMART as google and honestly not sure amazon will ever have that capability. But for 50bucks I guess you get what you pay for. ",
CM,"November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"This is such an awesome product! I saw the full-sized echo at a friend's house and was thoroughly impressed. I got the echo dot (I'm on a student budget) and hooked it up to a nice set of speakers in my apartment and I love the potential this thing has. It's not 100% there yet as far as the software but it is being updated on the regular, so its like buying a piece of technology that keeps getting better. I even bought one for my parents (who have a lot of smart devices in the house, but no central way to control them) as a gift. It works with most of the smart products u probably already have in your home including the nest thermostat/CO monitor etc. NOTICE: the 3.5 mm jack takes a bit more force than normal to &#34;click&#34; in when inserting an audio cable - your product is NOT defective lol.

"Roland W.","January 4, 2017 ",2.0,"&nbsp;Ok, the idea of not having to type your questions and getting pretty good and accurate answers (most of the time) is pretty amazing.  Set up was very easy, just download the Alexa App and then follow the step by step WIFI set up instructions. Right now I am only using it for basic requests (see video) and that works well. I will keep adding skills (these are additional little programs you can enable on the amazon.com website Just search &#34;Alexa Skills&#34; in the amazon search bar and it routes you to the menu. You can add sports teams, kids games etc. Alexa can tell you jokes (most of them are pretty funny and all so far are kid friendly).  Speaker quality is ok for such a small device - you can plug in an external speaker directly into the Dot and then you can control it through the Dot. I have a Sonos System (whole house), and I would have to get a separate DOT to plug into the sonos in my media centre, so the Dots can communicate. Have not done that so far. But it is a lot of fun to play around, get weather, movie times, play some background music or meditation songs etc. Just play around with it. I have a &#34;slight&#34; accent and it understands me without a problem.  Just be prepared that kids will yell at this little thing, demanding answers and a play buddy who gives them honest feedback on how their hair looks today :)    Currently I am using it mostly as a toy, but as my house is already rather high tech with everything wireless from thermostate (Lennox, which does not connect to ALEXA yet - per customer service) to security camera, Hue lights in some areas, I am planning on expanding the in house Dot Network over the coming months when manufacturers add more functionalities. I keep you posted.    I went on Amazon Skill website and enabled a ton of skills. Just make sure you write down how to activate them. (play 20 words, the secret door, bed time story etc.... you can have a lot of fun with these. I will get one for my daughters room so she can get &#34;Alexa, play relaxing songs for 15 minutes&#34; at bed time.

Hopels,"December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Replaced the larger Alexa Echo with the Dot 2nd Gen.  Obviously the much smaller size is nice.  I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.    The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.    We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.    Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.  I took off one star because while I have no issues with it, it sometimes doesn't &#34;hear&#34; my wife. ",
Rebecca,"January 19, 2017 ",5.0,"This little guy is fantastic! While I doubt anyone will be using the sheer wealth of functions this can perform (as some are, admitedly, quite lack-luster), the ones that I use it for are done well. Once the shiny veneer of new tech fades off, and you eventually stop asking Echo for jokes and punchlines, you won't be discarding her - which is common with other new innovations. Instead, you will probably use one of the following functions regularly, each of which I recommend getting the echo dot for:    -Setting kitchen timers: You won't think much of it until you try it, then you won't be able to go back. Just saying &#34;Alexa, start a timer for 20 minutes&#34; without jumbling for your phone, while simultaneously closing the oven is revolutionary. This is one of the best features Alexa has.    -Interactive Speaker Assistant: While I doubt audiophiles will be satisfied with Alexa's sound quality, that problem can easily be remedied, since you can just connect your own speakers through the audio jack, and Alexa will speak through them. The sound quality on the Echo Dot's speakers isn't bad, though, if you choose to listen through the dot. Either way, Alexa can search music from Spotify, Amazon Music, and Pandora via vocal commands. You can also set Spotify as your main music streamer (Amazon Music is the default, of course), so you won't have to verbally command Alexa to use Spotify, if that is your choice. It's great to just say a song, and have Alexa play it. ",
JMDK,"October 29, 2016 ",4.0,"The Good:    The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of &#34;Alexa&#34;, &#34;Amazon&#34; or &#34;Echo&#34;).    The Bad:    The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.    Overall:    We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature. ",
"Just me","March 14, 2017 ",5.0,"I am a big amazon fan and I depend on reviews. Let me start by saying I was so excited about this product even though my spouse was saying it will only make me lazy..Lol. I know there are several reviews on this product but here goes...I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen basically for the 2- level of our home; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive bigger one and too good to pass up. The Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the 2 floor!  Day 1 when I received it I was a little worried that I would need to send it back because Alexas first word would not sound; for example I would ask &#34;Alexa what time is it?&#34; and she would say &#34;Is 7:30pm&#34; or I would ask &#34;Tell me a joke&#34; and she would not say the first part of the joke, I asked &#34;how old are you?&#34; and the whole human part would not sound. FYI: you can read the answers on your app as well, that's how I knew I missed that part. The next day I came home and some kind of way she was answering all of the questions. I don't know if she just needed to be full charged or what, but the problem fixed itself.  I am really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. Considering everything, for $49 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to building your smart home, home automation and voice recognition technology. Overall, I would highly recommend this product. ",
SundayAtDusk,"December 30, 2016 ",5.0,"This was a Christmas present for my elder mother. We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device. ",
"The Bon","March 8, 2017 ",4.0,"We had an Echo and thought it was all we needed. We put it in our livingroom (by the kitchen) and I pick random songs to play during the day, but also ask questions whenever I'm watching a movie on TV or listening to a song and wonder if a star or singer is still alive (ask Alexa - Which is the Echo's name).  I put things on my 'shopping list and it goes on my phone automatically (and on my husband's phone too, since we both have the Alexa app on our phones.). Recipes, measurements, and facts about whatever. But it's nowhere near our bedroom, so I ordered an Echo Dot as an 'extension'.  I can't believe we lived without this little, inexpensive, companion. It's on my nightstand and acts as our alarm clock, news station, weather station, and music source that has EVERY KIND OF MUSIC you could possibly want, just for the asking.  We are so blessed to be living in a time where we can have these Amazon innovations at our fingertips. The Echo and Alexa both have replaced our clocks, encyclopedia, dictionary, stereo, cd's, etc. we ordered ours through the &#34;LOVE MY ECHO&#34; website where we also get all information on both. Thank you, Amazon, for a website like this one. ",

"Colleen M Traeger","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Impressed. At first I really enjoyed the Echo Dot. It was fun asking it questions. Then the novelty wore off. In order to have your questions answered you first DL an app then ask it to open something. The apps are strange lengthy names that are hard to remember like &#34;Alexia, open &#34;My  Horoscope to read my daily horoscope&#34; instead of a simple 'what's my horoscope&#34;. There are 10k apps full of interesting and useless things. Why it can't be developed where you DL an app to customize your needs is beyond me.    What's interesting is that you can make your home a smart home and control it remotely or just by speaking what you need.    I've also loved asking it to add things to my to do list as well as add things to my shopping list.    While I do like it, I'm just a little disappointed. I'm hoping that this is similar to when Dot Matrix first came out.    I can without a doubt see the value in this maturing. I'll hang on to it (in 30 years it'll be worth a nice bundle). Regardless of the slight pessimistic review, I do recommend it. ",
"Sassy and Oliver","January 28, 2017 ",5.0,"I have both the Echo, and the Echo Dot. This little Dot works as well as its big sister Echo, only.... the 🔊 speaker is a wimp. However, if you are looking to save a lot on the price difference between the two, this one is the perfect compromise. Just expect poor sound quality. I think you can connect the Dot to better speakers, I just have not learned how. I use the Dot in my bedroom, and the big Echo in my living room. The big Echo has fantastic speakers and I don't need to turn the volume up very high.  Buy this Dot to save money, or buy the Echo for great speakers...both work the same. ",
Dia,"March 6, 2017 ",4.0,"Alexa is a lot of fun. I have added some of her skills but they don't seem to function as expected. She only speaks English, which while I can understand programming another language could've been a huge investment, it's still a disadvantage.    My favorite features are:  `playing music via a paired speaker. That sounds silly, but it's so convenient to just yell &#34;Alexa, play iheart radio&#34; when busy.  `timers. Asking her to set a timer is really convenient  `shopping list. She can add items to your shopping list which you can view on your smartphone when out of the house. For this forget-everything-gal, that feature is really helpful.  `controlling it with the app. My husband still doesn't know how I can turn down the music from the other room - or turn it on. I'll keep it a mystery for as long as I can. It's nice to be able to shut off a timer or change the volume from my phone when I'm on the other side of the house. ",
Jarren,"March 11, 2017 ",4.0,"This is a great item, especially as a developer. My baby cousins also enjoyed this product so much, I bought them one for Christmas. You can ask Alexa for holiday jokes. You can also say, &#34;Alexa, tell me I'm beautiful&#34;.    I use it for an alarm clock, to play music on Spotify, and to hear daily facts. You can also get some exclusive Alexa only deals. As a developer, you can get free hoodies / shirts from developing Alexa Skills and submitting it to the app store.    Beware though, you might get noise complaints from your upstairs neighbor from having this device. I guess this device playing a few songs at volume 7 (out of max 10) playing music at 7 pm can net you a noise complaint. I didn't even know the speakers were that great, but apparently so! :grimacing: ",
"Sid Scheck","March 12, 2017 ",4.0,"&nbsp;It was about 2 weeks ago when I was talking with my friend about their Echo Dot and she showed me a few things. I thought very cool and maybe I should get one. Sure enough, 2 days later I won one at a company event. The Echo Dot is generally easy to set up. Be sure to have the Amazon Alexa  App downloaded when you are going to set up the Echo Dot. As I used it to ask questions, it has amazed me. I don't show it in the video, but I asked Alexa to put an item it my shopping cart and sure enough, there in my shopping cart was the item. I can see I will be using the Alex to listen to different types of music as well. So much you can do with it. Have fun! You will love it! ",
"Amazon Customer","March 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I love the size and the price but the speaker is horrible. I have seen better speakers in smaller things so it's not like it can't be done. I can say that the microphone is really well-made it can pick my voice up 20 feet away in the Next Room  at  moderate levels  without having to yell. Like the Alexa, I wish it was more informative, there are so many questions I asked that Alexa does not know the answer to but Google does. I also wish that a lot of the apps were not third party where you have to ask Alexa to ask the app to do something like my buddy you have to say Alexa ask my buddy to send an alert message to a family member because I have fallen and can't get up it would be nice if you could say Alexa contact my family member and tell them I have fallen and cannot get up. But aside from that I love the direction that it's heading, I just wish it was there already we have the technology to make it happen I can only assume there's red tape involved ",
"Amazon Customer","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I thoughtful Echo was interesting, but wanted to opt with just the Dot and use my own Bluetooth speakers. Unfortunately, Amazon discontinued the first generation just as I was able to order.  When the second generation was announced, I knew I'd get one.  With the $10/ month for 5 month plan for Prime members, it was a no trainer. Although I'm more heavily into Apple's ecosystem, and gave smart appliances (Apple)  they will work with Alexander too.  There is quite a bit of crossover. I'm excited and look forward even using the Dot as an alarm clock, awakening me with my Prime Music. I'm sure it's going to be loads of other fun too. I also have a Kindle Fire HDX, FireStick, etc, and know it will integrate nicely.    I have had it for about a week and it's VERY cool!  Does so much more than even Siri by being able to add skills. Also works great with my iDevices switched simulataneously with iOS HomeKit. This was a great buy! ",
Stephanie,"November 14, 2016 ",3.0,"I like this Alexia dot thingy! Sometimes though she talks to me when I am not talking to her. She thinks she hears her name. She seems kinda needy. She's always there. Listening to my conversations and trying to include herself in them. I have to tell her that I wasn't talking to her and to only talk when she's been spoken to. She doesn't get the hint. Also when she hears her name on the Alexia commercials she responds. Overall I really like this contraption. It's pretty neat. It tells me anything I want to know. She even sang me the alphabet like William Shatner one day. She hasn't done it since. We liked her so much we got another one for upstairs. Alexia even controls our lights. Our house is basically automated. ",
"this is me","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"Absolutely love these. We bought the tall Echo. Got on the list before it came out. Then we bought a dot for our shop, Then we went back and bought the deal that was buy 5 get 1 free. These are amazing. We have one for almost every room. Although, I do not advise that. Reason being is that when you say &#34;Alexa, what is the forecast&#34; and loud enough, &#34;all&#34; of them start giving you the forecast...lol So, we keep them spread out. We also gave a couple to our adult kids for Christmas.    Great for helping to figure out math problems, telling jokes and you can even order amazon items from your echo. There is so much the echo dot can do. They are a must have.    PROS:  the clarity is very good.  the compact size is perfect  you can ask almost anything and he will have the answer    CONS:  my only con is that they sometimes wake up without us even talking.    But, these are highly recommended for sure. ",
LTCJDC,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"After three months of use, I don't like the Echo Dot or Alexa's attitude. It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't allow you to return an item after 30 days. I'd be returning it if they did. Common language isn't as successful as when verbally searching Google. Alexa can't find things without exact phrasing. I argue with her everyday because she doesn't understand me, doesn't have the answer or would like to sign me up for some Amazon product or service. She apologizes a lot. It is very frustrating and forces you to use the Alexa App to find what you need. The App is pretty good to find and control what you want the Dot to do.  Alexa can't always find things on iHeart radio or Tunein even though you listened to it 10 minutes before. She will sign you up for Amazon Music in a heartbeat. She does understand what &#34;worthless&#34; means and it quick to take offense. The Skills aren't very helpful and are mostly silly snippets that seem to have been written by young kids. Buy Google Home instead. You won't regret it. ",
"R. Seehoffer","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Well, I ordered 2 of these a few weeks ago and they arrived today. Both are now set up and functioning using the Alexa app. Very cool, I must say. I added several skills, including TP-Link's Kasa to control several devices around the house, and a few others that seemed interesting--all are working well. I've gone through and played with most of the abilities, linked up my Google Calendar, and went through the voice training. I've had a little trouble with the Alexa app freezing up, and some stutter on a few radio stations playing through Tunein, perhaps due to high bit rates. Speaker quality was better than I expected, and mic pickup from various locations seems fine. They're a pretty nice addition to a connected home, at a fairly smoking price.    Update: As time goes by, this thing just gets better. I have it playing music in the background all day via TuneIn, controlling a number of TP-Link switches and lights throughout the house, and giving me relevant news/information as needed. There are some very cool installable skills available, although I noticed that many of these skills are redundant as Alexa already does them natively. These include telling me a joke (as for knock/knock, physics, science, Star Trek or Star Wars, Christmas, etc), flipping a coin, picking a random number between x and y, or rolling dice, weather for one day or many, Wikipedia info, etc. I am just now getting into IFTTT and see several possibilities there. I've had no hiccups at all getting Alexa to hear me across the house, and triggering the correct unit based on my proximity. Smart home control has also worked perfectly. I've got one unit on my nightstand, and one in the living room. Alexa is also very polite. Wish it 'goodnight' or say 'thankyou'--the responses are not what you'd expect. Like I said in the title--a lot of fun. ",
ChuckG,"April 10, 2017 ",2.0,"I bought two of these Echo Dots because I already had some great bluetooth speakers, and did not need to purchase the larger Echo. I intend to stream music, and begin moving our home towards home automation.    Set up was simple via the IOS Alexa app, and I was off and running with Alexa streaming music from Pandora and Amazon Prime Music.    The App also detected my Honeywell thermostat, so Alexa can override and cool my house on demand beyond my already programmed thermostat schedule.    Last night, I purchased a Logitech Harmony Hub, and now my Living Room TV, Roku, Media Player and Home Theater system now work via voice!    My next step will be integrating some Phillips lights and hub into the system.    While for some there may be a learning curve to add connected devices, there are lots of resources online, and many YouTube videos too.    The only thing, Alexa cannot clean the house or make dinner yet! (g) ",
"Amazon Customer","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Being a previous X10 user, was looking for a better and more up to date way of controlling my lights and other devices.  Amazon Echo provided this control point at a price point that made it economical to place devices in multiple rooms.  I coupled it with the Samsung SmartThings hub and control devices from GE, Cree and GoControl as well as my Harmony device used to control my Entertainment center.  Alexa was able to recognize and control the lighting devices but for the Harmony devices you need to ask Alexa to ask Harrmony to perform an action and this appears to be the case for a lot of other add-ons where you need to remember the service name to issue a command.  My biggest disappointment was that Alexa is 100% reliant on its Internet connection and connection to the Amazon servers.  If your Internet connection is down, or the servers are down then Alexa is about as useful as lead boots at a swimming competition.  In the 4 weeks since I deployed, my Internet has been down once and the Amazon servers unresponsive making Alexa useless to control my devices or even set a wake up alarm.  Would be nice if a set of base commands were installed on the device that allowed it to function with locally connected devices without having to talk to the Mother Ship first. ",
"Michael G. Fisher","January 7, 2017 ",5.0,"While we are still trying to figure out all it can do and how best to ask it what we want, we are amused by it and sometimes frustrated by it.  The reason I gave it 5 stars is because of an unexpected benefit.  Our oldest daughter has a pretty challenging speech impediment and using Alexa has forced her to slow down and enunciate clearly.  Not only is Alexa learning how to understand my daughter, my daughter is also slowing down and learning to communicate with Alexa.  The huge benefit is she is now slowing down to communicate more clearly with us.  This is something her speech therapists have been working on with her for years.  Alexa has gotten these results from her in a few months.  The Echo Dot is a useful tool and will only become more useful as its capabilities grow.  Thank you, Amazon. ",
Mooj,"March 17, 2017 ",3.0,"Love this. Makes life just a little easier. When I wake up, I can have Alexa give me the weather and any reminders for the day. If I get the urge to listen to a particular song, album or artist, all I have to do is ask (this is particularly useful while playing video games or packing for my move). Pretty much anything I want to know, I just ask. She even plays games (you got nothing on me when it comes to Simpsons trivia, Alexa!). Why can't life always be this easy?    Definitely considering buying another one for the other room in the new apartment. And I definitely recommend to anyone.    One suggestion to anyone buying, however. Make sure you have a good speaker to attach it to because the sound isn't great out of the dot itself (which is understandable given its size and cost). I use a TDK A33 Bluetooth portable speaker, which gets great sound for a little portable speaker and works flawlessly with the dot. ",
"Peter E.","March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"I love this!!!  When these first came out I didn't think it would be something I would use much.  At least, not until my whole house has smart appliances.    My wife didn't want me to buy it she couldn't see the use for it.    She became addicted to it the first night. Especially if you sign up for Amazon Prime Music which has a huge selection for about $4 a month.    We've been watching less TV and listening to more music which is wonderful.    I love using the shopping list and to do list feature.    My 2.5 year old loves it and already talks to Alexa. We play kids song mixes they have and he dances away.    The weather and time, calculations and conversions and Wikipedia are really helpful to have around.    It's loud enough for a living room but I do want the full sized one eventually and move this to a bedroom.    The voice recognition is amazingly good too. You don't have to pause for a moment after saying Alexa. Just speak as you would to anyone home. It's really impressive.    You also don't notice it's even there, the design is so good.    I can go on and on so let's just say I didn't think I would use it much but heard rave reviews from friends and love having it!!! ",
"Eric Smith","February 11, 2017 ",5.0,"OK, maybe Alexa deserves a better rating given she does what she is advertised to do. But after having her in the house for a month, I found the Echo Dot was only being used for novelty purposes or responding to false positives. At the price point, it seemed like a good opportunity to try out a home assistant, but it wasn't something we used on a daily basis. In hindsight, it seems pointless to use in conjunction with a smart phone. I have a Nexus with Google Assistant which does everything the Echo was doing for me and usually does it better. Plus the phone is almost always with me rather than isolated in one room of the house. &#34;OK Google...&#34; works with my IoT switches and outlets, news briefings, weather updates, online information and adding items to my shopping list. Aside from novelty, I see no point is buying into another eco-system unless you really like instant ordering from Amazon. ",
"Avatars VR Arcade","January 22, 2017 ",5.0,"This product is amazing and clever. It works great for when you want to just listen to some music or hear the news etc. without fiddling with any devices. Especially when your busy doing other activities like cooking. It also has some very funny and smart programming. You will get some very funny responses depending on what you ask it. Also the microphones are excellent and can understand you easily even when the music is playing. My kids love asking it to tell a joke. I love asking it factual information that I have questions about and want a quick answer. I have it connected by Bluetooth to my TVs soundbar. It's great, buy it now. How many products can make you and your family smarter?    Only thing I would improve is adding an audible tone to the ring that lights up when it is ready for a response so if you are not looking at it, you would still know that it heard you call it's name and is ready for a command or question.

"G. Bigelow","April 3, 2017 ",2.0,"This is on this dot only. I'll give 5 stars on my overdo remove of my second one. Let me just iterate that I love the Dots. Way more than expected to.    This one however has developed problems with the Bluetooth and now plays intermittent static instead of music over an external speaker. Oddly it's voice broadcasts just fine and it plays music through its internal speaker perfectly. That is why I think the problem lies in its transmitting over Bluetooth. I didn't bother getting warranty protection and as the only option on the order was to write a review I'm guessing I'm SOL on resolution. This isn't a major problem as it will still work fine for what I wanted it for. And if I want to go through the bother of switching all the alarms and settings I could switch this one for the one in the kitchen.    To sum up: amazing product, problem with one aspect of one unit.

rikatika,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I absolutely love my echo dot. When I first heard about it, I was like &quot;hmm, my phone does most of that.&quot; But I was so wrong! My friend got an echo dot, and after spending 5 hours at her house asking Alexa for farts, I immediately went home and ordered one for myself. She gives me a flash briefing in the morning that I can customize with my favorite news channels and things like the word of the day. She can also keep track of what food is in my pantry, fridge and freezer. There is really no limit to the things she can do and new skills are constantly being added. The one minor drawback is the device itself doesn't get very loud, but it can be easily connected to bluetooth speakers, so it is not a big deal. I also love that I can play any station from Tune in with just a simple command and it links to most music streaming services you may already have an account on. Totally worth it for the price. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Echo vs Echo Dot.. I started off buying an Echo for my bedroom which is where I listen to music the most. After a lot of thought I figured I would buy a dot for my kitchen because the Echo is no where within ear shot. Now having owned both for a couple of months here is my opinion. If you like to listen to your music loud, you like to sing along, in the middle of this singing fest you want to know what the weather is.. firmly say Alexa what's the weather like? and you're good to go. In those situations a full size Echo is a must.. The Echo Dot owner never really puts the volume past 2-3. If you put the volume anything higher than a 3 (4 if you're lucky) I find myself screaming at Alexa to turn off. I will keep my Dot simply because I can't justify spending $200 on an Echo for the kitchen. For $50 it is pretty reasonable. ",
"Steven Thomas White","March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"I love my Amazon Echo!  The one problem - I had to 'yell' at it to hear me from upstairs!    I happened to have a Bose Wave Radio in my bedroom already - and purchased the Dot to allow for Echo convenience on my second floor.  It still amazes me how often I use both my echo and dot on a daily basis.  From setting my morning alarm, waking up and getting weather and my new 'flash briefing', to adding items I'm running out of onto my shopping list, I can't imagine NOT having an Echo within voice range.    While the Dot does have it's own speaker, it's not made to have a 'robust' sound - only a serviceable sound.  To get the most out of your Dot, I highly recommend having a speaker you can hook it up to.  My Wave radio works GREAT, but there are many options available (some sold as kits with the Dot on Amazon).    Also, for all of you Echo owners out there, don't forget to always end your commands with 'Please'.  Eventually the robot overlords will look back at this time to determine who was polite! ",
"A. Nonymous","April 18, 2017 ",3.0,"The Echo Dots are nice - we bought a '6-pack', kept one and handed the rest out to friends and family as Christmas gifts.  It's a bit 'gimmicky' to have a device to get the weather and tell you jokes until you enable skills with smart home devices - that's when the real potential shows.  The WOW moment was connecting the Echo Dot with the Logitech Harmony Hub for voice control of our complex AV setup.  Great to tell Alexa to turn on the tv or pause the show we're watching or to change channels without looking for the remote.  Integrates decently with our Nexia thermostat, though the functionality is limited with that skill (and that's on Nexia to improve their Echo integration).  Looking forward to (hopefully) better natural language recognition and situational awareness so Alexa 'understands' what you want to do, even if you don't say the 'correct' words in the specific order programmed into the skill.

"ERICA ARRIAGA","April 8, 2017 ",5.0,"To give it five stars it truly must be powerful. I finally caved in and decided to get an Echo Dot to take my home automation a step further. First off the price is great. very reasonable and easily cost effective to add more. now I have mine in my bedroom and it works flawlessly. the app is easily to connect to. (I have an iPhone)  and connecting my Nest (smart thermostat) and philips hue was a breeze, along with my wemo switches. My absolute favorite is having IFTTT (if this then that) application installed. Every night I say &#34;Alexia trigger bedtime&#34; and like magic all the nights in my room turn off. Since my room is so close to the kitchen i often step over to set a timer or alarm and when my lights start flashing through the house i know my timer is off. Let me tell ya, this alone has saved a few dozen cookies from burning 😉.  I'm fine with the loudness of the speaker as back noise to whatever I'm doing and setting up Pandora and I heart radio is a breeze. Also connecting a Bluetooth speaker is super easy and works like a charm.    I often have Alexia set alarms, turn on and off the lights, news brief .  I trigger (using IFTTT) bedtime, partymode(makes the hue lights change colors in a rainbow fashion), oh and try alexia trigger self destruct 😂    I really enjoy my Echo Dot and i definitely see myself buying the larger one plus another Dot in the future. I hope over time it continues to improve and get smarter 😊 ",
Richismo,"March 30, 2017 ",4.0,"I've had the Echo Dot 2.0 for about a week. I got it after I confirmed my FLUX WiFi bulbs would work with Alexa. I had 4 bulbs. All of the other features of Alexa were exciting, but not my primary concern. I wanted to be able to walk into my house and turn on my lights with my voice. It works 100%. Alexa turns them on in less than 2 seconds from my command. It is great. It allows dimming, by percentage. I said,&quot;Alexa, turn the living room lights to 50%.&quot; Done. I thought, ok, lets see how far this will go. I asked for 10%. Done. I stopped at 4%, but it was really impressive that it would work so well. I am under the impression that Flux is working on the skill to allow color change, but they currently do not do it with Alexa.    Due to the success of the lights, I decided to get a WeMo wifi switch for my bedroom lights. They are too small for WiFi bulbs, so the switch was my only option. Works like a charm with Alexa.    I have a Honeywell wifi thermostat as well. It works great. It will raise and lower the temperature by voice, either by saying the actual temp you want (72 degrees, for example) or by degree(Alexa, turn the thermostat up 2 degrees). It will almost instantly do this. The only thing I'd like, and I've seen it said before, is for the thermostat to allow me to ask &quot;what is the current temperature?&quot;    Overall, it is a great tool to inexpensively automate your home over time. I highly suggest it. ",
JimKata2000,"February 1, 2017 ",5.0,"This was my second dot.  I'll just comment on this 2nd gen one.  The speaker in this one seems a little better than the 1st gen  on, not that it matters since I'll eventually hook it up to a sounds system. Hower for speaking items I don't mind listening to this one.  It has a warmer voice than the 1st gen which is already hooked up to clock stereo.    The 2nd gen comes some kind of near field check so the one closest to you responds.  The 1st gens were updated.  Works pretty well, though there are a couple commands that get thru to all that hear you.  Most annoying is volume control.  I had turned up my outside stereo to enjoy music by the pool.  Later that night, back inside I asked my living room Echo to play some music and it blasted me out of my chair.  I am now more careful to adjust volume outside standing right over the dot. No big deal, but something to be aware of. ",
"Mike W.","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"The Amazon Echo Dot is the perfect product for tech fans that want to be on the cutting edge. This Dot does what other voice recognition devices cannot. Attached to phone apps, Alexa can do it all: she can play your favorite music, tell you about the weather, order you a pizza from your usual place, and change the thermostat, all while counting down the time until your cupcakes are ready. The beautifully designed device is easy to use and utilizes ever adapting technology that improves each time it is used.    Usability:  Amazon has built an app to accompany the Echo Dot which helps you learn your way around this device. With an extensive user guide, this app, although sometimes clunky, can lead you through tutorials in order to troubleshoot, install new information or tips to better use Alexa in your day-to-day life. The fact that the Dot is handsfree make the entire device worth it. You could be cooking in the kitchen and want to know a substitute for butter or how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon and not have to dirty your phone or computer when going to check. My favorite feature on the device is the timer setting. Although it seems insignificant, I never take it for granted when I can set a timer while not having to leave a pot on the stove.    Technology:  The technology used in the Amazon Echo Dot is amazing. The “mind” of Alexa is always growing. The more that you use the device the more Alexa understands you and your patterns of speech. The Dot uses six speakers in a concentric circle, and one in the center of the top of the device to pick up speech from anywhere in the room. Unlike Siri, who hears up the word “seriously” as the beginning of a voice command, Alexa is very good about only responding if her name is spoken. Not worry if you have already named you child Alexa and still want to be able to use the Echo Dot, the voice command can be switched in the app settings. The device has several light up features that are used in sequence. When Alexa hears you speak to her, she lights up to show the direction of sound and when she “thinks” about it the ring spins and blinks until she finds the answer.    Design:  The Dot is a minimalist’s dream! The sleek cylinder has a modern feel, and being the smaller version of the Amazon Echo it is the perfect device for a smaller place or a short shelf. The compactness of this device allows it to become inconspicuous in order to not interrupt the interior of the room it is in. The design includes four buttons on the top of the Dot. The buttons use very intuitive icons rather than words, however if the icons are not familiar there would be a bit of a learning curve involved. The Echo Dot is the perfect addition to a tech fan’s home!    I would recommend the Amazon Echo Dot to the technology user who is looking for a wonderful upgrade to the previously available voice recognition technology. The ease of usability of this beautifully designed technological marvel would fit in even the tiniest of homes! ",
"Debra Todd","January 11, 2017 ",5.0,"I had to move the Dot around my house until I found the ideal spot that we could actually hear each other. She's not as loud as her older sister, Echo. But regardless of that, I love the tiny thing. (we settled for the end of my kitchen counter. lol) I'm able to talk to her from my living room with ease, and i'm able to hear her. I did have her in the LR, but the sound on the TV always got in the way. Big sister, Echo is in the bedroom, and I have given them their own name. (Alexa and Amazon). Other than the loudness, I don't or haven't noticed any difference in them Other than the aforementioned sound and the smaller size. OH, and the PRICE. If you have a tight budget but can't afford the Echo, get the Dot. Save some money by buying the Dot, $49.00 compared to  $179.00. That's only a suggestion, of course. Both are good products. I hope this helps. ",
Emery,"February 10, 2017 ",5.0,"so I have had alexa for just over  month and at first I loved it. Now Alexa does not respond, freezes, wont dont what you ask, constantly just shutting off and even when I use fhe anydo app....it wont even put items on it anymore. Also it stopped syncing with my amazon prime music and pandora stations......now it says I need to be an amazon prime member, but when I check my aet up....it still shows my prime information. What a waste of money. I should have just tried a bigger one and maybe the speakers would have been betted too. horrible when tryibg to listen to the news updates at the dinner table and alexa is only 10 feet away and you cant hear what she is saying over any sound.

"David Merritt","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Turns out the 90-day warranty matters.  Bought mine in Nov '16, now in Mar '17, the bluetooth connectivity is no longer working.  It'll say it's connected, and it'll play audio from a speaker, but the audio cuts in and out about every second--it's NOT playing much more than it IS playing.  I confirmed it was the Echo Dot device because I moved the Dot right next to the speaker, and I also tried it with another bluetooth speaker in another room.  Both situations led to the same problem--horribly intermittent bluetooth connectivity.  My phone could connect and play audio with no problems for both speakers.  There were no changes in our home in terms of RF-emitting devices--the Dot just stopped working one day.  Looks like I'll have to connect with the audio cable permanently.  Other than that failure, I've loved having it! ",
"K Durden","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I LOVE my new Echo Dot!  Im giving a 4 star rating because Ive only had it for a week or so and im still learning what i can do with it. plus I did have to send in one comment when it could not define a word and Id already read in earlier comments that it should be sble to define this particular word.  However, I was pleased that I received a prompt response acknowledging that the Dot was giving an improper response.  other than that, its just been a matter of learning how to phrase a request. 99% of the time Alexa gets it right.  The other 1%?  I find you need to phrase the rewuest correctly and without hesitation. Alexa doesnt wait for you to think about it. She is ready to work!!!  I will definitely be getting more Dots for other rooms in my home!  Bravo, Amazon! ",
W,"March 14, 2017 ",2.0,"This baby Echo is still learning to walk. I have the big Echo and love it. Sadly, the Echo Dot I bought only worked half of the time. Even sadder, when I sent it to Amazon for repair, they returned a completely broken Echo Dot back. Double whammy.    Commenting on the product when it DID work, it was okay at best. &#34;Alexa&#34; functions are great (as with the big Echo), but the build quality is below my expectations; it looks, feels, and sounds like a cheap, light piece of plastic to me. The kind of object that shifts every time I bump into the charging cable (even lightly). The good news is the price and size. Might give it another try a generation or two later. ",
Kate,"March 25, 2017 ",4.0,"I'm not a techie and wouldn't have looked into Alexa or smart home stuff on my own.  But I was given one, and that's when life changed 😆  Okay exaggerated, but very cool. I set out to learn what all she can do. The lights were the first thing that struck me. I've changed to smart lights throughout the house. I don't need every light controlled since I'm not so lazy I can't go flip a switch, but I did realize how much this would help with the minimum evening lights, particularly the outside lights. It's very dark on my part of the street and I hate coming home without all three front lights on and I hate for my husband and teens to do the same. Also handy when the kids used to leave an upstairs light on over night. Now I can be sure all Lights are off.   Easy access music, weather, traffic, and alarms/timers are great.  I've only had it a few weeks and I'm sure I'll discover all sorts of new stuff she can do. All set up and programming has been super easy and smooth. I also bought a SmartThings hub to control a variety of lightbulb brands and plugs.  I'm ready to order a couple more!  It's a great affordable way to modernize life for average people. Very glad I was given an echo dot. ",
Val_NYC,"February 3, 2017 ",2.0,"Good: This is the product we've been waiting for. All the internet knowledge at the tip of your fingers... just say &#34;Alexa!&#34;, she'll be there for you answering to an enormous amount of questions. Ordering stuff online, giving you the traffic info on your way to work or just the forecast, keeping your life organized.   Of course, it's hard to resist from purchasing additional components...it's so cool to be able to lay on the sofa, turn the lights on or off, operate any IR devices you might have, locking doors, closing the blinds, starting the coffee maker or controlling the temperature using your voice. It doesn't matter the light switch is next to your head or the stereo/ TV remote is right in your hand. It's the feeling that you step into a new world with huge further options to discover, it's the power to having such a powerful tool at your disposal.  And I know the developers are just warming up.  Bad: Without WI-FI all home gadgets are useless. ",

Twlb,"November 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I love these. We have four of them, and an Echo. But you don't need an Echo to use a Dot. The only big difference between the two is that the Echo has a much bigger speaker - but the Dot can be connected to any speaker you already own. Same &#34;brain&#34; in both.    If you're choosing between the Echo, Tap, and Dot, to me it's a no-brainer. They're not that different, but the Dot is way cheaper. The advantage of the Tap is that you can load songs on it, but it only has Echo/Dot's brain if it's connected to wi-fi.    We have Amazon Music Unlimited, and to use on several Dots, you need to buy the more expensive plan. Otherwise it only works on ONE - not one at a time, but one.    We use these for music, radio programs, audio books, timers, alarms, news, Hue lightbulbs, and misc questions, including some fun jokes. Hands-down the best technology device out there. ",
"Dee N","March 27, 2017 ",1.0,"We've been Echo users since the very beginning, so have experienced how rapidly Amazon has been improving the utility of this tool. We didn't expect to use it much, but now use it multiple times a day.    Compared to the full Echo, the Dot does 90% of the utility, but definitely falls flat when listening to music. It's okay to listen to NPR, but the internal speaker just doesn't do music justice. Of course, you can just add an external or Bluetooth speaker if you want to improve facility.    We use Echo daily to set timers and alarms, add things to our shopping and to-do lists, look up information (weather, measurements, etc.), listen to the radio, listen to music, etc. We're considering adding remote control of our lights so we'll have voice control of those as well. Not as advanced as Sarah (from Warehouse 13), but definitely a fun and useful tool! ",
Catrine,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"I have the amazon echo and wanted a second one for my home gym. I do mainly use it for the amazon music. It cost $3.99 per month with a huge selection of songs. When I got the Dot , I did not expect to pay more for the music. Unfortunately, I will be paying $7.99 per month for both. (that is with amazon prime) without Prime it would be $9.99 per month. The Dot does not have a great sound like the echo. If you are using it for music, I suggest getting a speaker. I do wish we could pick our own name. You have Echo, Alexa, or Amazon.  I use it mainly for the weather, find out what movies are playing, a wake up call, and music. It is fun to use. I am sure they will come out with an even better one in the future. For $50 you can't go wrong. Just wish I did not have to pay for Music. The whole family will enjoy it. ",
arizonahd,"December 8, 2016 ",5.0,"Instead of getting the larger Echo, I bought this to use with a pair of Bose speakers powered by cheap amplifier (also from Amazon). The result is a perfect sound system that cost me roughly $70, as the speakers were given to me. I must say, I am really impressed. The Alexa system works very well, we have no problems switching Pandora stations or asking her to play a particular song. It's a dream setup. For example, we had guests over and instead of playing one station, everyone asked Alexa what to play. Asking her the weather and news is cool but I lack all the cool gadgets that work with her. I haven't asked her to buy me anything yet, I figured I will do that when I am 600 lbs and bed bedridden from all this convenience. I'm starting to sweat from all these keystrokes, but I would definitely recommend this to the gadget lover and lazy person alike. ",
DS0078,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Been an IT guy for 20+ years. I also install audio/visual systems like Control4. So I am not easily impressed. I put off buying an Alexa device for some time and finally broke down to &#34;try one out&#34; just for the hell of it. So I bought a Dot because I have at least 5 small powered speakers around the house and garage. But let me tell you, this thing is freaking scary cool! I feel like I am in an episode of Star Trek (yes I am that old). First off I am a Prime member, so I ask for music and it plays music. I linked my Pandora account. I asked for Alexa to play Stevie Ray Vaughn from my Pandora account. She replied with, You do not have a Stevie Ray Vaughn station, would you like for me to add one? I said Yes. She added and started playing. Freaking cool! I am also an active stock trader so I asked for stock quotes and she was not able to answer that. Keep in mind this technology is in its infancy! I can only imagine what I will be able to control or ask in the near future?!?! I like the idea of the Alexa with the built in speaker but 179.00 is kind of high in my opinion when powered speakers are so cheap. The only thing is you need two outlets to power both when you buy a DOT vs the Alexa with a speaker..... But to start out and give this thing a try, WOW is all I can say about the DOT right now. VERY impressed. ",

Terry,"November 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my echo dot. Having a hands free remote control is truly helpful from setting timers to smart home control. The other day my power had gone out overnight and I kept thinking I should set my stove clock every time I walked by but didn't have my phone. Duh! Alexa what time is it. Fixed. I'm getting older and it's easy to space on the shopping list. Alexa, add milk to the shopping list. Then when at the store I just open the Alexa app and look at my shopping list. Fixed. I think Alexa is going to be my new best friend. Lol. My setup is using a Hook SmartHome server with etekcity switches. The advantage is the cost. The hook talks wifi to rf. The etekcity switches are rf and only $5 per outlet vs. $35-40 for wemo. So now Alexa turn tv on, Alexa turn living room light on. Love it! Now if only Next up when budget allows will be a Logitech Harmony - wifi to IR to control the apple tv, dvd player etc. Alexa Channel 5. Alexa pause movie. Now if only I could find inexpensive light controls. Alexa Night mode! Someday.    Oh, and Alexa is really awesome at picking music for me, I've listened to a bunch of new artists and the idea of needing to work on a playlist is vanished. Alexa Music! And so easy to Alexa Skip or Alexa Thumbs Up. Five Stars - but would give 10 if I could.    P.S. I gave some thought to purchasing Echo instead but had some speakers so went with the dot. I'm glad I did. Not only less expensive I've found that sometimes Alexa can struggle hearing the wake up word if the speakers are close and loud so I plan on keeping the dot at a bit of distance from the speakers. The Dot is fabulous at hearing the wake up word over the tv and managed well even when I had a cold.. ",
MityMike,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Setup was very easy and I enjoy the Dot so far. Voice recognition is great and I used it to stream my music, as a kitchen timer, to set alarms and to read the news or ask for the weather. It does not stream Audible books that have not been downloaded and the Audible Streaming in Amazon Prime does not read your books back. It does not support Airplay and some Bluetooth speaker have streaming interruptions which are probably due to power saving settings of the speaker, not the Dot. However, you have better sound quality when connecting the Dot via a 3.5mm audio cable. remember though, that if a Bluetooth speaker is paired via Bluetooth, it does not switch back to the cable connection automatically. It told me it added Bing to my Alexa applications, when it did not understand what I was looking for and I cannot find Bing anywhere. I am still not sure if I would trust Amazon purchasing through voice completely. Some of the Alexa applications are useless and you have to address them by voice for the Dot to find the right answer &#34;Alexa, ask soandso app for information on...&#34; which means you have to know the Alexa skills out of the top of your head. So overall, a nice help, but still has a long way to go. ",

"A Reader","November 28, 2016 ",4.0,"I bought two dots to serve as devices that could easily play music and news etc. without having to plug my phone into a speaker.  They work OK in this respect; I have them linked up to spotify, and they manage that fine, although I find that 50% of the time I need to go and use the Spotify app, because my voice commands aren't understood right (Alexa is often unwilling to play a Spotify playlist, for example; and she seems unable to understand a request like &#34;play the new album by ___&#34;  But a couple of serious problems.  First, one major feature I want is the ability to play podcasts.  This seems obvious, right?  In theory, Alexa supports this via TuneIn.  But I've gotten it to work only a handful of times.  You should be able to say &#34;play the program ___&#34;.  Often Alexa will identify what I want to hear, tell me she is getting the latest episode--and then nothing happens.  Very frustrating.  The other thing I find annoying is the way bluetooth is implemented.  I started connecting my phone via Bluetooth to play podcasts.  But then whenever I entered the room, I got a very annoying and loud message from Alexa about how she was connected to my phone.  Extremely annoying.  These are basic features; I don't want anything fancy.  I just want this device to be able to play podcasts and to be usable as a not-annoying bluetooth device. ",

SundayAtDusk,"April 11, 2017 ",2.0,"This was a Christmas present for my elder mother. We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device. ",
"Rik Conaghan","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My wife received one of these for Christmas, and even though i am a techie kind of guy, I had never really seen a use for these. Now fast forward to March, they seem to have multiplied, and I now have 5 of these creatures living in various rooms throughout the house (this is the issue part :-)) they have been far more useful than i would have thought.    We have one in the Kitchen, which serves not only as musical accompaniment to our culinary activities, but as a personal shopping assistant to help maintain the shopping list. It sits there, ever faithful, just waiting for me to pull a product from the cupboard, realize it is the last one, then either add it to the shopping list we use to go to the store, or to go ahead and order it directly from Amazon. You really can't get much more convenient than that, especially as our minds aren't quite as sharp as they used to be (well we do have 2 young kids....)    We have three more in the bedrooms, they are used for playing music (built in speaker is more than adequate for our daughters audio needs, plus they both love talking to Alexa and having complete control of what they listen to) they also are being used for alarms (useful on school-day mornings!) and our 5 year old has been probing Alexa to answer some of the questions that pop into her head about various subjects (the meaning of life, quantum mechanics, M-theory, who is the guy dressed in the Barney suit, etc...) We have one in our bedroom for the same reasons, but also use the Bluetooth option to switch between playing music in the bedroom and the bathroom while taking a shower (just turning the Bluetooth speaker on in the bathroom moves the audio playback from the Dot to the speaker in the bathroom, then back to the dot again after the speaker is turned off again) so the music follows us wherever we may roam.    Our latest addition to the Dot family resides in our dining room, we like to have some music in the background while we eat, and the Dot covers this role nicely also.    Excellent little gizmo's and, i am sure, will multiply again as soon as we discover a &#34;need&#34; to have one of these in a different room in the house.

I waffled between this and the Echo, but decided to start with the small one and some existing computer speakers; we'll probably upgrade to better speakers eventually, but for now, it works really well.

"Amazon Customer","December 27, 2016 ",2.0,"Echo vs Echo Dot.. I started off buying an Echo for my bedroom which is where I listen to music the most. After a lot of thought I figured I would buy a dot for my kitchen because the Echo is no where within ear shot. Now having owned both for a couple of months here is my opinion. If you like to listen to your music loud, you like to sing along, in the middle of this singing fest you want to know what the weather is.. firmly say Alexa what's the weather like? and you're good to go. In those situations a full size Echo is a must.. The Echo Dot owner never really puts the volume past 2-3. If you put the volume anything higher than a 3 (4 if you're lucky) I find myself screaming at Alexa to turn off. I will keep my Dot simply because I can't justify spending $200 on an Echo for the kitchen. For $50 it is pretty reasonable. ",

Unfortunately, Amazon discontinued the first generation just as I was able to order.  When the second generation was announced, I knew I'd get one.  With the $10/ month for 5 month plan for Prime members, it was a no trainer. Although I'm more heavily into Apple's ecosystem, and gave smart appliances (Apple)  they will work with Alexander too.  There is quite a bit of crossover. I'm excited and look forward even using the Dot as an alarm clock, awakening me with my Prime Music. I'm sure it's going to be loads of other fun too. I also have a Kindle Fire HDX, FireStick, etc, and know it will integrate nicely.    I have had it for about a week and it's VERY cool!  Does so much more than even Siri by being able to add skills.

Hopels,"April 18, 2017 ",3.0,"Replaced the larger Alexa Echo with the Dot 2nd Gen.  Obviously the much smaller size is nice.  I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.    The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.    We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.    Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.  I took off one star because while I have no issues with it, it sometimes doesn't &#34;hear&#34; my wife. ",

Like the Alexa, I wish it was more informative, there are so many questions I asked that Alexa does not know the answer to but Google does. I also wish that a lot of the apps were not third party where you have to ask Alexa to ask the app to do something like my buddy you have to say Alexa ask my buddy to send an alert message to a family member because I have fallen and can't get up it would be nice if you could say Alexa contact my family member and tell them I have fallen and cannot get up.

Amazon Echo is not required to use Echo Dot.&#34;    The Echo Dot is a really cool limited personal assistant.  It sets up in minutes and begins to work immediately thereafter.  Upon summoning Alexa I was able to subscribe to Prime Music with access to millions of songs; get immediate current weather and moon phase; create a running shopping list; and re-order products from my Amazon order list. Although I am not familiar with all of the features that the Echo Dot allows, one feature that really impresses me is the interactive process with Alexa and the (her) smooth voice.  I just asked Alexa to sync up with my Kindle and she began to read the last book I purchased.  Her voice is incredibly human-like with proper rate of speech, phrasing, inflection, intensity, syntax, and voice stress.  There is little tinny robotic sound, if any.  What an incredible advancement over previous technology used in the Kindle!  I enjoy asking Alexa any multitude of questions which usually she will answer.  Alexa answers my questions on history, facts, etc. and of course will tell a joke on demand.  This is a cool and fun device which I described to my family as a limited personal assistant.  I will update this review as time progresses.  The Echo Dot in terms of a speaker will easily fill an average room with clear sound.  Obviously there is no thumping bass, etc. but the sound is pretty remarkable from such a small device.  I just downloaded the Alexa App onto my iPhone to help me work the unit as well.  Another feature is that Alexa responds immediately.  When I command Alexa to stop the music the unit goes silent as I am finishing the command.  It is amazing.  At this point I would recommend the Echo Dot to anyone and rate it at five stars for a competitive price and lots of features.  I am sure that more will be added each year.  Well done! ",
"K Durden","November 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I LOVE my new Echo Dot!  Im giving a 4 star rating because Ive only had it for a week or so and im still learning what i can do with it. plus I did have to send in one comment when it could not define a word and Id already read in earlier comments that it should be sble to define this particular word.  However, I was pleased that I received a prompt response acknowledging that the Dot was giving an improper response.  other than that, its just been a matter of learning how to phrase a request. 99% of the time Alexa gets it right.  The other 1%?  I find you need to phrase the rewuest correctly and without hesitation. Alexa doesnt wait for you to think about it. She is ready to work!!!  I will definitely be getting more Dots for other rooms in my home!  Bravo, Amazon! ",
"Amazon Customer","December 27, 2016 ",5.0,"First off it's not the talking computer on star-track, but I wasn't expecting that. If your a big music fan you will love this little device. My only complaint is the Alexa android app is a piece of crap that really needs work. I'm glad i went with the Dot since it easily plugs into my existing sound system. I'll be picking up another for upstairs on the black Friday sale. I'll  wait a while to get LED bulbs etc. They are still first generation and over priced.    BTW: these are fully portable, there is not battery but you can move them around the house, it just takes 30seconds or so for it to reconnect to your home wifi. ",
voyager-sue,"March 25, 2017 ",4.0,"We were just talking about robotic servants.  Now that I have Alexa, I feel that I have an agreeable servant.  Alexa, Add peanut butter to my shopping list; play KPFA FM radio; what time is it? what's the weather?  play Cal Tjader (I thought she'd stumble on this because fo the T in his name).    I have 2 Dots and an Echo.  This will sound silly, but the main attraction was the shopping list.  I have no memory, so now if I run out of something in the bathroom I can just yell, Alexa, add hand cream to my shoppping list.  I had improved over the paper list by putting shopping items into Google Calendar on my phone.  But, just yelling at Alexa is such an improvement over: go get the phone; open the calendar; type or speak the items; go back to what I was doing.  So call me decadent.  I love Echo and Echo Dot.    Oh, and this was easy to set up.  It asked my phone how to log into the wifi. ",
"R. Seehoffer","November 11, 2016 ",5.0,"Well, I ordered 2 of these a few weeks ago and they arrived today. Both are now set up and functioning using the Alexa app. Very cool, I must say. I added several skills, including TP-Link's Kasa to control several devices around the house, and a few others that seemed interesting--all are working well. I've gone through and played with most of the abilities, linked up my Google Calendar, and went through the voice training. I've had a little trouble with the Alexa app freezing up, and some stutter on a few radio stations playing through Tunein, perhaps due to high bit rates. Speaker quality was better than I expected, and mic pickup from various locations seems fine. They're a pretty nice addition to a connected home, at a fairly smoking price.    Update: As time goes by, this thing just gets better. I have it playing music in the background all day via TuneIn, controlling a number of TP-Link switches and lights throughout the house, and giving me relevant news/information as needed. There are some very cool installable skills available, although I noticed that many of these skills are redundant as Alexa already does them natively. These include telling me a joke (as for knock/knock, physics, science, Star Trek or Star Wars, Christmas, etc), flipping a coin, picking a random number between x and y, or rolling dice, weather for one day or many, Wikipedia info, etc. I am just now getting into IFTTT and see several possibilities there. I've had no hiccups at all getting Alexa to hear me across the house, and triggering the correct unit based on my proximity. Smart home control has also worked perfectly. I've got one unit on my nightstand, and one in the living room. Alexa is also very polite. Wish it 'goodnight' or say 'thankyou'--the responses are not what you'd expect. Like I said in the title--a lot of fun. ",
"Eric Smith","December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"OK, maybe Alexa deserves a better rating given she does what she is advertised to do. But after having her in the house for a month, I found the Echo Dot was only being used for novelty purposes or responding to false positives. At the price point, it seemed like a good opportunity to try out a home assistant, but it wasn't something we used on a daily basis. In hindsight, it seems pointless to use in conjunction with a smart phone. I have a Nexus with Google Assistant which does everything the Echo was doing for me and usually does it better. Plus the phone is almost always with me rather than isolated in one room of the house. &#34;OK Google...&#34; works with my IoT switches and outlets, news briefings, weather updates, online information and adding items to my shopping list. Aside from novelty, I see no point is buying into another eco-system unless you really like instant ordering from Amazon. ",
"G. Bigelow","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"This is on this dot only. I'll give 5 stars on my overdo remove of my second one. Let me just iterate that I love the Dots. Way more than expected to.    This one however has developed problems with the Bluetooth and now plays intermittent static instead of music over an external speaker. Oddly it's voice broadcasts just fine and it plays music through its internal speaker perfectly. That is why I think the problem lies in its transmitting over Bluetooth. I didn't bother getting warranty protection and as the only option on the order was to write a review I'm guessing I'm SOL on resolution. This isn't a major problem as it will still work fine for what I wanted it for. And if I want to go through the bother of switching all the alarms and settings I could switch this one for the one in the kitchen.    To sum up: amazing product, problem with one aspect of one unit. ",
310EI,"April 3, 2017 ",2.0,"We bought an Echo Dot as an early Christmas gift to ourselves and we're so glad that we did.  It's a very useful gadget because there's such a wide variety of things we can ask Alexa to answer or tasks that she can do for us (eg: alarms/timers, calendar, ordering, weather).    Since one of the tasks that we wanted Alexa to do for us was play music, we subscribed to Amazon's Unlimited Music Plan for the Echo Dot.  It's well worth the low monthly fee to be able to ask Alexa to play any song or album anytime, without having to buy all of them individually.    ​Millions of songs are available through one groovy gadget (and the Unlimited Music Plan).    We have the Echo Dot in our home and listen to music without any external speakers.  As far as we're concerned, the internal speaker emits a decent array of sound.  Is it as robust sounding as hooking it up to our surround system amplifier or other external speakers?  Of course not, but it does sound a lot better than most internal device speakers of similar size.  For those of you that don't like the internal speaker, you can utilize the 3.5mm or Bluetooth speaker options.    If we say, “Alexa, Play The Top Songs by Phil Collins”... then that's exactly what she does.    Keep in mind that when you ask Alexa for the &#34;Top Songs&#34; by a soloist or group, they may not always be your favorite songs.  A work around for that is to ask Alexa to play a particular album that contains the songs you prefer to hear.    The screen-shots show you how we asked Alexa to play an album vs the top songs. In addition, they show you what we see when logged-in to the Alexa app via the Chrome web browser.    FYI:  When asking Alexa to play an album that has a long title, we realized that she responds accurately when we ask for part of that title (view Elton John & Michael Jackson screen-shots).  Be sure to look at what we said to Alexa vs what the whole album title is labeled.    I should mention that we did ask Alexa to search for a product, which she did along with telling us the best options and their cost.  Afterward, she asked if we wanted to buy the product.  We said yes and she placed the order for us once we gave her our confirmation code (Settings: Voice Purchasing).  We recommend setting that up so other people cannot place orders without your consent.  It's convenient for us to have voice purchasing enabled when we're &#34;unplugged&#34; at night (except for Alexa).    The skill that we use the most is Weather Sky, it gives us a detailed weather report that we use several times each day.    ​At the time of this review, we haven't used any of the smart home features, but we didn't buy it for that purpose.    PLEASE NOTE:  We purchased the Echo Dot at its listed price, we did not receive any discount to post this review. ",
"Austin Rodden","March 17, 2017 ",3.0,"Alexa is to immature for a product release.  Doesn't understand complex request like &#34;What  can you do for me now.&#34;  I hate to say it but if you're easily frustrated,  skip Alexa for now and  go with the  white meat alternative. On a positive if you tell her she's useless she thanks you and if you tell her to self destruct she does it. ",
"Nancy Banner","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought it to play music and, hooked up to our stereo, it does that well. You have to remember just what to ask for - not as simple as clicking a song or album icon on a screen - since it doesn't tell you what's available.  It also plays back Audible books fine, provided you remember the title well enough (it won't list your Audible or Kindle libraries). The one we got cannot find our Kindle library, although we have lots of tts-eligible books in it, according to the Alexa app. I'm now finding out how many calls to Amazon and time on the phone it will take to get this fixed.

"this is me","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Absolutely love these. We bought the tall Echo. Got on the list before it came out. Then we bought a dot for our shop, Then we went back and bought the deal that was buy 5 get 1 free. These are amazing. We have one for almost every room. Although, I do not advise that. Reason being is that when you say &#34;Alexa, what is the forecast&#34; and loud enough, &#34;all&#34; of them start giving you the forecast...lol So, we keep them spread out. We also gave a couple to our adult kids for Christmas.    Great for helping to figure out math problems, telling jokes and you can even order amazon items from your echo. There is so much the echo dot can do. They are a must have.    PROS:  the clarity is very good.  the compact size is perfect  you can ask almost anything and he will have the answer    CONS:  my only con is that they sometimes wake up without us even talking.    But, these are highly recommended for sure. ",
"Colleen M Traeger","January 9, 2017 ",3.0,"Impressed. At first I really enjoyed the Echo Dot. It was fun asking it questions. Then the novelty wore off. In order to have your questions answered you first DL an app then ask it to open something. The apps are strange lengthy names that are hard to remember like &#34;Alexia, open &#34;My  Horoscope to read my daily horoscope&#34; instead of a simple 'what's my horoscope&#34;. There are 10k apps full of interesting and useless things. Why it can't be developed where you DL an app to customize your needs is beyond me.    What's interesting is that you can make your home a smart home and control it remotely or just by speaking what you need.    I've also loved asking it to add things to my to do list as well as add things to my shopping list.    While I do like it, I'm just a little disappointed. I'm hoping that this is similar to when Dot Matrix first came out.    I can without a doubt see the value in this maturing. I'll hang on to it (in 30 years it'll be worth a nice bundle). Regardless of the slight pessimistic review, I do recommend it. ",
Mooj,"December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Love this. Makes life just a little easier. When I wake up, I can have Alexa give me the weather and any reminders for the day. If I get the urge to listen to a particular song, album or artist, all I have to do is ask (this is particularly useful while playing video games or packing for my move). Pretty much anything I want to know, I just ask. She even plays games (you got nothing on me when it comes to Simpsons trivia, Alexa!). Why can't life always be this easy?    Definitely considering buying another one for the other room in the new apartment. And I definitely recommend to anyone.    One suggestion to anyone buying, however. Make sure you have a good speaker to attach it to because the sound isn't great out of the dot itself (which is understandable given its size and cost). I use a TDK A33 Bluetooth portable speaker, which gets great sound for a little portable speaker and works flawlessly with the dot. ",
"G. Cancilla","March 6, 2017 ",4.0,"It's a decent product but somewhat of a scam. Read the very fine print. If you want to know what the temperature is ask Alexa. It works. You want some headlines. Ask Alexa. It works. You want sports scores. Ask Alexa. It works. If you want to start making a smart home it's okay. BUT. A bunch of the stuff you want it to do is going to cost you. I use the free Spotify version. If you want it to work with the Alexa, you have to have a paid subscription. If you want to order from Amazon with Alexa, you have to have a Prime account.    Bottom line: If you want full functionality, it's gonna cost ya. Be prepared to shell out some money. ",
ChuckG,"February 11, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought two of these Echo Dots because I already had some great bluetooth speakers, and did not need to purchase the larger Echo. I intend to stream music, and begin moving our home towards home automation.    Set up was simple via the IOS Alexa app, and I was off and running with Alexa streaming music from Pandora and Amazon Prime Music.    The App also detected my Honeywell thermostat, so Alexa can override and cool my house on demand beyond my already programmed thermostat schedule.    Last night, I purchased a Logitech Harmony Hub, and now my Living Room TV, Roku, Media Player and Home Theater system now work via voice!    My next step will be integrating some Phillips lights and hub into the system.    While for some there may be a learning curve to add connected devices, there are lots of resources online, and many YouTube videos too.

"David Merritt","January 7, 2017 ",5.0,"Turns out the 90-day warranty matters.  Bought mine in Nov '16, now in Mar '17, the bluetooth connectivity is no longer working.  It'll say it's connected, and it'll play audio from a speaker, but the audio cuts in and out about every second--it's NOT playing much more than it IS playing.  I confirmed it was the Echo Dot device because I moved the Dot right next to the speaker, and I also tried it with another bluetooth speaker in another room.  Both situations led to the same problem--horribly intermittent bluetooth connectivity.  My phone could connect and play audio with no problems for both speakers.  There were no changes in our home in terms of RF-emitting devices--the Dot just stopped working one day.  Looks like I'll have to connect with the audio cable permanently.  Other than that failure, I've loved having it! ",
"Dianna Dougherty","December 19, 2016 ",2.0,"Received as a gift so can't complain much. It is JUST OK. There are def some bugs and its not very intuitive.  You can only ask it tings that it knows such as to play music or what the weather is. Everything has to be preset in the app. Nothing is automatically learned.  With google you can ask ANYTHING and it will read you the Wikipedia answer.  Not with alexa. Her knowledge is quite minimal.  One major flaw that i found and reported to amazon is this:  If you use a bose Bluetooth speaker with it and are playing a music and tell alexa to stop it will stop the music.  Okay there. Now you can walk away or leave your house and if your speaker has an automatic shut off as soon as the wireless speaker turns off it will begin playing the last song it stopped on trough its internal speaker so i have to tell it to stop again. Why would this be useful?? If i tell alexa to stop playing music and then power off the wireless speaker it starts playing again from built in audio. Immagine waking up in the middle of the night to music playing. Not fun. Needs to be as SMART as google and honestly not sure amazon will ever have that capability. But for 50bucks I guess you get what you pay for. ",
Cole,"March 14, 2017 ",2.0,"I made the mistake of not doing much research on this product. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE ONLY PLANNING ON USING IT AS A SPEAKER. The speaker is really bad and not loud in the least bit- after doing research it I guess its not meant for that. Maybe the alexa app would be cool with it if you are linking this with another speaker. I returned it and got a UEBoom for not that much more money and it has fit my needs a lot more- which is the simple need of a really good speaker. ",
"D. Meyer","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Probably the best music source system I have.  Only problem is many of my past purchased CD's are no longer needed!  The money I could have saved!  (sob).  The setup was so easy I could not believe I was able to use it almost immediately.  You do have to tweak the system a little by going to the app and selecting setup.  Advice!  Put your location in it to include street address, as well as city and state.  Otherwise, if you ask it for weather or traffic conditions, it will give you Tucson, Arizona, which I believe is the default location.  At least on mine it was.  Not only a nice source for music but also a nice toy to play with.  Oh, one other thing!  You will want to get a speaker since the built in speaker has little or no bass. ",

The Dot works identical to the Echo except it has a much smaller speaker.

Also it took me 10 minutes to install the Harmony skills for Alexa and I was operating my Harmony Hub connected equipment. I am working on getting Alexa integrated with my Homeseer HS3 soon.

My bathroom is not big so I can hear music or news playing while I'm in the shower almost as well as when I'm at the sink.  My only note is that I wish it was slightly louder.

Chromosome,"April 11, 2017 ",2.0,"In Sep 2106 I bought a second generation Echo to set up at work. I was never able to get it to work for longer than a couple of days.

It connected, but it would fall of the network. Finally, I gave up and I took it home in Marcy 2017, thinking that I would set up it there. Took a while.

Unlike the Google Home, the device follows more specific trigger phrases, and doesn't keep context from one voice command to another, but it does an excellent job.  There are thousands of additional skills you can add - including IFTT which allows all kinds of integration with different apps and devices (including things like Harmony remote controls).    From weather forecasts, to directions, to setting reminders, alarms, timers or asking questions that get searched on the internet, it does a really good job.  For added try asking it about political figures, Siri and other AIs, or other silly questions and enjoy the answers!

My apartment is about 600 square feet and at the loudest I can't really hear her when I leave from the immediate vicinity (my dad has the regular echo and the sound quality is insane- there's no comparison). I just got her a friend - a Bluetooth speaker that I think will solve the problem.    She is pretty effin awesome though.

I can ask &#34;what's the traffic&#34; and she'll tell me how long it's going to take to get to work (pretty close in terms of timing); &#34;add ____ to the shopping list&#34; - I never forget the list on the counter since it shows up on the app; &#34;play _____&#34; radio station, Pandora channel, news flash - super helpful.  The speaker is decent, not great, so I just connected it to a Bluetooth speaker and it's perfect.  I got one to give as a gift - they love it as well. ",
Dan,"April 13, 2017 ",5.0,"I really do like this thing.  I'm holding onto one star because it can't wake you to music.  I can tell it to play almost any song or tell it to wake me up at a certain time, but it doesn't have the ability to become a replacement for my radio alarm clock.  Waking to music (without using silly hacks) should be a something it should do.  But no, now I'm stuck with two devices on my night stand because I can't give up my radio alarm clock. ",
Choose901,"March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I love my Dot.  My brother got an Echo at Christmas and it seemed neat.  After much reading I decided to jump on this in an attempt to &#34;smarten&#34; up my home a bit.  It is great so far!    I'm using a Broadcom RM2 (IR and RF device) to control my lights (Etekcity RF Outlets) and many other IR items (TV, Xfinity, Receiver, Bluetooth Speaker, etc).  The Dot picks up voice commands very well and functions correctly the majority of the time.  I would suggest doing a few voice trainings with Alexa as it does seem to make a big difference.    Though it took some time to setup, now setting up new items is a breeze!  Really good job with the Dot.  It is so small too :) ",
"Anakalia - Red Herring","December 25, 2016 ",3.0,"My whole family has been enjoying having Alexa around.  We're constantly asking her questions.  Some helpful and some not so helpful to some that are unknown or that she can't answer or understand.  I'm sure she'll get better and better with updates in time.    From homework, to cooking, to everyday life, traffic, stores, weather, music and silliness, we've been able to turn to her for some help and entertainment.  We've uploaded some of the &#34;skills&#34; but can't seem to remember what they're all called to access them so they're not used very often.    There's been a few times that she doesn't perk up when we talk to her but other than that, even with a Bluetooth speaker not too far away, she usually hears us over some loud music.    We're planning on getting a smart hub or some other add ons to work with her but for now, she is low key and takes up minimal space.    I am still debating whether or not to get a few more.  I would love one in my room and I know a couple of people who would like one under the Christmas tree. ",
Dinnerplate,"February 7, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is pretty useless for the most part. She is good at telling me what time it is, setting a timer while cooking or an alarm. Half the time for music she doesn't know what you are asking for so its easier to just use my phone on a speaker. If you are buying the Dot because you want good sound quality through an external system its awful as well. For alexa to respond the system needs to be on, so you end up pluging and unpluging her from whatever.    She also uses bing for search which is literally the worst thing ever.    I also bought this to allow me to control caseta lights, which worked for about a month. Now alexa either tells me that the device doesn't support being turned off/on or that it didn't respond in time, as the lights do what I asked.    I'm going to try google home, it looks way more promising :/ ",
"H. Ramsey","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This was a surprise Christmas gift and it turned out to be a very nice surprise! We had thought about purchasing it so the kids could ask it questions, but never seriously considered it. Then we received it gift.  Turns out it does a lot (a LOT) more than answer questions. The answering questions part is great, sometimes you have to rephrase it so Alexa understands what you are saying, but she does a good job answering 90% of the time.    She easily recognizes our voices. Even my 4 year old can trigger it most of the time. When there is a lot of noise in the background she can add a word or two, but she seems to be learning as you go and we have not tried the voice training with her yet (there are 6 of us in the house so a lot of background noise). The key seems to be learning how to say what you are asking. If you want a song then use the word &#34;play&#34; first, if you have a question then use the question word first, etc.    She does so much more than just answer questions. I love the news updates. I don't need to check my phone for top stories only to get distracted by the random junk that pops up with the news. You can choose the news channel (I saw BBC, NPR, CNN, Fox, and more offered). At the end of the top stories (goes about 5 minutes) she gives a weather update and forecast for your area. The update changes every hour so if you feel the need to get more news than go for it. Ask her if it is going to rain in the next hour, what the traffic is like for your commute, and more.    Playing whatever song/artist/station you want is a great way to listen to music. Want to hear a song - just ask.    The timer is useful. I used to grab my phone when I needed to set a timer, now I just ask Alexa. When the kids ask for tablet time or they need to do homework/reading time I can just ask Alexa to set the timer for me. This saves me going to my own tablet or phone (which I usually forget to do) and means the kids really get 15 minutes tablet time when I say they can rather than 45 minutes when I realize I forgot to set the timer.    She has so many skills that we have yet to try, but the ones we have are fun additions. There is a great game, magic door, that works like a choose your own adventure (complete with sound effects). The kids are currently in the middle of trying to find a wizard. You can pause the game and re-enter at any time. Alexa guesses what animal (or thing) you are thinking when you play 20 questions or the animal game. There is a bedtime story skill where she tells a random bedtime story using your child's name. After telling my 4 year old a princess story last night (using her name) she said &#34;now it is time for bed and no you can't have another glass of water&#34;. My daughter thought it was hilarious. It would be great for an elderly or bed-ridden person looking for something to talk to. It will also read audiobooks.    The kids love the joke feature (Alexa tell me a joke) and my husband likes trying to trip her up with random odd questions (What is the meaning of life, who's your daddy, who let the dogs out, etc). Ask her what her resolutions are or the highlights of the year. It is good for a laugh.    I haven't hooked her up to our thermostat yet and we don't have any smart lights/locks so I can't comment on that feature. I am seriously considering moving all my calendar stuff to google so she can plan my day for me. We put a code on ordering so the kids don't accidentally buy something (you can turn the feature off completely if you would rather), but you can still add things to lists when you think about them (then access that list in your amazon account).    Overall, great! I would even consider getting a few more (you could use it as an alarm clock plus extra features in a bedroom, to control things in your living room, this one is in our kitchen for lists/timers/etc).

"Jeffrey E,","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I had trouble deciding whether to give this 4 stars or 5, because there is room for improvement.  But if 4 is &#34;I like it&#34; and 5 is &#34;I love it,&#34; then it's a solid 5 for me.    We've had the Dot for a few weeks, and it has already become something that we use all the time. I love being able to ask Alexa to add something to my shopping or to-do list whenever it occurs to me, and not have to stop and write it down. Being able to set timers verbally is great while cooking.  The volume and sound quality is good for its size - certainly not what I'd rely on as a &#34;whole house&#34; speaker, but fine for streaming music in the kitchen while cooking, for example.  I've also set it up to control a couple of smart switches for lights, and it's so handy that it makes me want to do a lot more home automation. The voice recognition is mostly quite good, if you speak clearly.  We like that they've given Alexa just a bit of personality, and we enjoy asking her random questions in search of &#34;Easter egg&#34; responses.    The main complaint I have is the Alexa app for Android.  I've found that it often has trouble loading when I'm away from my home network. This has reduced the usefulness of the feature that I use most frequently: the grocery list. While at the grocery store, I'll sometimes finish shopping in the time it takes the app to fully load.  I got around this by installing the &#34;Any.Do&#34; app, which imports the Alexa lists seamlessly, and I've been happy with that work-around.  But I hope that Amazon streamlines the app in future versions.  I will note that you can also access the interface from your computer at alexa.amazon.com (you don't have to use a smartphone or tablet), and that works fine.    All told, it's been so useful and fun that I'd definitely recommend it, especially at this price point! ",
"John M.","January 2, 2017 ",5.0,"Not a real fan of the Dot but too late to return it.  Doesnt hear me half the time even when its not on or the volume is low.  I can stand right next to it and it wont respond.  Did all the technical troubleshooting still no go.  Sound quality, in my opinion, is not slightly less than the Echo, it is a lot less than the echo.  Max volume is lame.  The dot is good for small garage use for music.  That's about it.  Was thinking I'd go ahead and get an echo but I hear the Google one is pretty impressive so I am considering the options. ",
"John Hack","November 30, 2016 ",5.0,"(I will be willing to change my review of this device if AMAZON fixes this device because I really did like it for 3 months until it started to glitch out randomly. but otherwise, I will leave this a one star.)

Just today I asked &#34;Alexa, Play songs by The Who&#34;, she lights up and replies &#34;Playing Songs by The Who from Spotify&#34; and then...wait....wait...keep waiting...maybe it's a quiet intro?... NOPE! not playing... Upon asking &#34;Skip&#34; (maybe she was hung up on a song, which she has done before), she starts playing some random ass song by KANYE WEST!?!?!?

The only thing it does well is let me do voice commands to check and arm my Vivint home security and home automation system. I'm thinking of just unpluging it and not worry about it always allowing &#34;Big Brother&#34; to listen to my home.  Very limited functionality and does NOT live up to the hype.

"Douglas Zukunft","March 10, 2017 ",1.0,"The Amazon Echo Dot is a fun little device. I use it mainly because (a) I love Star Trek and love saying 'computer, ***' and (b) I wanted something that could trigger my new Philips Hue lights and connect those to planned Sonos speakers for an immersively fun AVH experience when watching TV/movies, listening to music, making Marvin Gaye proud or throwing parties. They do this well.    My biggest gripe with the Echo Dot is that Amazon has seemingly disallowed Google search on the device (likely as there is now a Google Home and they are competitors...except in the search engine market). You can hack this, but it is quite an involved manual process. Moreover, you oddly are unable to play music from your catalog or an online service (Amazon Music, iTunes, Spotify, Pandora) for your alarms, although you can play from these services on the device. That is really bizarre and a limiting feature. There are a ton of 'skills' you can teach Alexa, but most of these are completely pointless or, worse, lame. Also, I have been unable to find a way to change the accent of Alexa. Personally, I think it would be more fun to have male or female voices in various accents. Who wouldn't want an English Butler (Michael Cane would be my vote), Magel Barrett Roddenberry for the iconic Star Trek computer voice or Morgan Freeman because, well, he's Morgan freakin' Freeman. And let's add Sam Jackson into that mix.    All in all, there is a lot of potential for the Echo products and home integration. Hope Amazon listens to its customers and starts expanding the ecosphere.    P.S. For the folks with the privacy concerns given the 'always on' feature. You can mute the devices to have your super secret conversations. Just make sure your throw your iPhone in the freezer and smash your smart TV so the NSA can't listen. ;) ",
"Dee N","April 25, 2017 ",2.0,"We've been Echo users since the very beginning, so have experienced how rapidly Amazon has been improving the utility of this tool. We didn't expect to use it much, but now use it multiple times a day.    Compared to the full Echo, the Dot does 90% of the utility, but definitely falls flat when listening to music. It's okay to listen to NPR, but the internal speaker just doesn't do music justice. Of course, you can just add an external or Bluetooth speaker if you want to improve facility.    We use Echo daily to set timers and alarms, add things to our shopping and to-do lists, look up information (weather, measurements, etc.), listen to the radio, listen to music, etc. We're considering adding remote control of our lights so we'll have voice control of those as well. Not as advanced as Sarah (from Warehouse 13), but definitely a fun and useful tool! ",
Rebecca,"March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"This little guy is fantastic! While I doubt anyone will be using the sheer wealth of functions this can perform (as some are, admitedly, quite lack-luster), the ones that I use it for are done well. Once the shiny veneer of new tech fades off, and you eventually stop asking Echo for jokes and punchlines, you won't be discarding her - which is common with other new innovations. Instead, you will probably use one of the following functions regularly, each of which I recommend getting the echo dot for:    -Setting kitchen timers: You won't think much of it until you try it, then you won't be able to go back. Just saying &#34;Alexa, start a timer for 20 minutes&#34; without jumbling for your phone, while simultaneously closing the oven is revolutionary. This is one of the best features Alexa has.    -Interactive Speaker Assistant: While I doubt audiophiles will be satisfied with Alexa's sound quality, that problem can easily be remedied, since you can just connect your own speakers through the audio jack, and Alexa will speak through them. The sound quality on the Echo Dot's speakers isn't bad, though, if you choose to listen through the dot. Either way, Alexa can search music from Spotify, Amazon Music, and Pandora via vocal commands. You can also set Spotify as your main music streamer (Amazon Music is the default, of course), so you won't have to verbally command Alexa to use Spotify, if that is your choice. It's great to just say a song, and have Alexa play it. ",
arizonahd,"December 8, 2016 ",5.0,"Instead of getting the larger Echo, I bought this to use with a pair of Bose speakers powered by cheap amplifier (also from Amazon). The result is a perfect sound system that cost me roughly $70, as the speakers were given to me. I must say, I am really impressed. The Alexa system works very well, we have no problems switching Pandora stations or asking her to play a particular song. It's a dream setup. For example, we had guests over and instead of playing one station, everyone asked Alexa what to play. Asking her the weather and news is cool but I lack all the cool gadgets that work with her. I haven't asked her to buy me anything yet, I figured I will do that when I am 600 lbs and bed bedridden from all this convenience. I'm starting to sweat from all these keystrokes, but I would definitely recommend this to the gadget lover and lazy person alike. ",
"Alexa&#039;s Boyfriend","March 14, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought an Echo Dot for a secret Santa gift at the suggestion of a Best Buy sales person and my best friend, having really no clue as to what it is or what it does. I had never heard of a DOT before. They assured me it was a &#34;hot item&#34; this year.  So I got it home and looked it up and realize that it was Alexa!! I had seen her in action at my uncle's house a few months ago, but I did not recognize it since it was so much smaller without the speaker. I loved it then, and the very thought of having one for myself was too much!    The fact that this Echo Dot is small, quaint, yet a very nice speaker, it's perfect for my small house. And the fact that I can pair it with the bluetooth speaker I already have is what sold me on the idea of keeping her for myself!!    I decided on not sending my secret Santa this little gem. I sent them some virtual reality glasses as a replacement, and got to work on programming Alexa right away.  Within an hour or so, I was completely smitten with her. Not only is she fun to chat with, but also VERY helpful with everyday things... I have had her in my home for less than 72 hours, and I've already had her setting alarms, playing Christmas music, setting timers for my cooking, creating and sending me shopping lists, telling me jokes and Chuck Norris facts, and calendaring dentist appts..  I never knew that she was everything I needed! As it is, this is one of the most amazing little home assistants that I never knew I always wanted! In fact, I already refer to Alexa as my &#34;girlfriend&#34;.    My daughters we're introduced to her and absolutely fell in love with her. One of the coolest little things was when I was out shopping, I texted my daughters and asked if they wanted anything from the store. I instructed them to just tell Alexa to add whatever it was to the shopping list, and tomato soup and hot cocoa was sent to my shopping list on my phone immediately!!    She has everything I've wanted for my daughters recently, including an alarm clock, timer for &#34;computer time&#34;, a massive music player, an educational tutor, and has the ability to help them with their homework. They will get hours and hours and hours of entertainment and helpful tips and tricks from her in the years to come.    Now... if I would have known then (3 days ago) what I know now, I would have bought EVERY single one of them in the store to give out as gifts this year!! The DOT has been such a popular gift this year that when I decided to buy another one for my daughters to have in their own room, EVERYONE, (including Amazon) were OUT OF STOCK! I couldn't even order one until after Christmas!  We tried Amazon, Best Buy, Bed Bath and Beyond, Staples, Wal-Mart...you name it!  We literally called or looked up EVERY Best Buy in 5 different states to try to find one... there were no Echo Dots in Arizona, Utah, Idaho or Nevada. Once we extended our search into California, we FINALLY found one in Bakersfield. I made a quick call to a family member and they promised to pick it up and ship it to me in time to be under the tree for Christmas morning! We bought it online for an in store pickup and it's now on its way!  Was all the trouble worth it?  Hell yeah it was...especially when my daughters absolutely freak out when they find their own Alexa under the tree for them. ",
"Meghan Blake","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"It's a cool concept for the product but the majority of the time it says it doesn't understand what i am asking even when it is a simple question. If you open the app on your phone it tells you what you asked recently so it is easy to see what work she got mixed up on. Most of the time I can't believe it didnt understand a simple word and confused it for something else. Or if it didnt mix up words it still doesnt know the answer to the question. I really wanted this to be a great product as i got it for a gift for my dad but more often than not he ends up asking Siri his question and gets an aswer after Alexa &#34;is not sure what you are asking.&#34; ",

Middlebunny,"March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"I've been an avid Amazon customer since they started.  I have 2 kindles and was relatively satisfied.  I read all the rave reviews for the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.  They seemed legitimate; however, I guess those reviewers either had low expectations or were incentivized to express those favorable opinions.  After going on an Echo Dot, Tap and Echo purchasing frenzy, I now have a total of 3 Dots,1 Tap and 1 Echo and am suffering buyers remorse.    If you need or want to know the local weather or get  flash news updates on command, the Echo or Echo Dot are your devices.  I, on the other hand, use them for music streaming.  I find that the &#34;sleep function&#34; has flaws, voice recognition/comprehension needs great improvement and everyone should know that it is really unnecessary to buy more of these devices unless you have multiple amazon music accounts such that you can stream on those separate accounts from different locations/rooms.  Otherwise, users should know that the devices cannot be linked together for simultaneous streaming.  They also cannot be used by different parties to stream different music from each different device.  Apparently, Amazon Prime Music only allows streaming to one device at a time.    The Tap cannot be used for streaming unless a wireless connection is available.  I wouldn't recommend connecting via an unsecured connection so unless you have a secure, mobile wireless connection, the Echo Tap is nothing more than an expensive, portable bluetooth speaker which you can purchase for much less than the cost of an Echo Tap.    One might notice that the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap are often paired with supplemental bluetooth speakers with 2-3 item purchase combination discounts.  This is a very misleading promotion as it leads one to believe they can be used for simultaneous streaming.  That is not the case at all.  Unfortunately, the E-Dot only has a one-way BT connection.  Either you play music from the E-Dot or the BT speaker; but, you cannot play music from both.    There are a lot of Applications for Alexa, the voice operated system used to operate the E-Dot and Echo.  Unfortunately, a lot of them have complicated wake phrases/statements.  If you don't phrase the statement exactly right, the app won't work and Alexa will not understand the command.  You can honestly spend more time trying to phrase things correctly to trigger Alexa then it might have taken for you to manually execute what you wanted to do like creating a shopping list, or recording water consumption.    Another shortcoming with Alexa is the slow re-fresh rate of the application.  Sometimes, you have to completely exit out of it, stop it from running in the background on your phone and then reload it in order to get it to reflect your most recent commands or current &#34;now playing&#34;.  In addition, there are other limitations specific to music streaming.  Let's say you want to stream a specific artist all day long to soothe a pet with separation anxiety.  If 1) you set the sleep timer for longer than you'll be away (ex. for 12 hours) and 2) Alexa confirms she will stop playing in 12 hours, that isn't exactly true.  Alexa will actually stop playing when she reaches the end of the artist's play queue which may only be 4 hours of music.  Theoretically, you can manually or verbally set Alexa to repeat the queue; however, I haven't tested this successfully yet.  It may only repeat the queue once rather than indefinitely until stopped by the sleep timer.    My final Alexa app gripe relates to the repeat function.  Unlike the iTunes or Amazon Music apps, Alexa cannot repeat one song in a queue.  You'd think that toggling the repeat button 2 times would trigger this function; however, all it seems to do is toggle the repeat option to the &#34;off&#34; position.    All in all, individually each product has its benefits so my rating is a low 3.  There is just no reason, other than needing a device in a location outside of the primary product's voice range, to purchase more than one device.  My thought is that the Echo-Dot is the most versatile of all 3 products; however, the Echo has better sound quality.  I have noticed the improved sound quality on the Echo; but, the improvement really doesn't make up for the price difference.  If I could do it all again, I'd invest in the Echo Dot for home and an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker for work that I can connect to the iTunes or Pandora applications on my phone.  That way, I will still be able to stream Amazon Prime music through the Dot at home for the stressed pet while playing comforting music in my office. ",
"Scott Dau","March 25, 2017 ",5.0,"I really like this product.  It was very easy to set up.  The voice recognition is very good.  She comes out of the box with built in features (skills) that get you going fast.  Adding new skills is very easy and ready to access immediately.  Although the database of new skills is still very small and frankly, pretty crappy, that's not Amazon's fault.  It's just like the App Store, it's up to the &#34;people&#34; to create skills for us to download.  I paired the Echo Dot with a Wemo Lightswitch and a Wemo Insight Plug.  I control the living room lights and my bedroom lights (from a lamp) via Alexa.  It's very convenient.  I plan to expand with more Echoes and more Wemos.  There's a few cool accessories to get for the Echo like the Amazon authored Zero touch care mount (to bring the functionality of Alexa on your phone into your car).

"Old Radio Guy","December 22, 2016 ",3.0,"Fun for entertainment, but nothing more. Timer and alarm functions require an Internet connection, so if it loses connection and you had an important alarm or timer set, forget it.

When we ask her a question sometimes an orange light appears and she says &#34;Sorry, there's no Internet connect&#34;, even though the app says she's connected. Today I asked her to set a 10-minute timer. When the timer went off, she wouldn't cancel it. When I asked her if she knew what &#34;stop&#34; meant, she gave me 4 definitions of stop.

The phone has too many features -- even just simply turning on music may mean she spends time looking at stuff online, texting, or playing with apps.

autumn,"March 26, 2017 ",2.0,"My kids like the echo dot.  It plays music, answers questions about the weather, and does addition/subtraction etc..

It also takes a little long for echo dot to answer questions.  I understand that it is impossible to answer all questions, but I expect echo dot will be able to answer a lot more than what it currently does.  At least, the programmers should collect the type of questions echo dot is not able to answer and then add more facts to their knowledge base.

"Mister Gizmo","April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I was just learning to live with my disappointment over an LG &#34;smart&#34; TV I'd bought recently that is anything but smart. In addition, it has the worst user interface I've seen since the 1980s. Fortunately, Amazon has brought out a device that works, works well, and is very intuitive. It was a little bit of a problem setting up, because the instructions are so limited, but once over that small hump, it's been fine. I'm surprised at how well it understands commands, even with so-far limited exposure to my voice to learn from.    If there's a frustration, it's mainly that the Dot (and Alexa devices in general) have a lot more potential than what's available right now. As with any new device, it takes a while for third parties to figure out what capabilities are possible, and then to spend the time and effort developing them. As just one example, I could see the Dot acting as an intercom, even a rudimentary telephone to connect Dot/Alexa users. I'm thinking particularly of elderly or handicapped people who'd like something that only requires voice commands. But I'm willing to wait. And since most of the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, the Dot's hardware should be good for a few years.    Now if Amazon would only invest a little more time to bring its Kindle browser, which has been in beta for years and years, into something that actually works. You can do it, Amazon! The Dot shows that you can be great at software if you really try. :-)    Update: I did experience one wrinkle when buying a Dot for a friend. It arrived pre-registered to me. Trying to use the normal setup for the new user didn't work. I finally realized that I had to de-register it from my account, sign out of the Alexa app (and reset the Dot), then sign in as a new registrant. This is explained in Alexa help, but it wasn't obvious at first. I don't know if it's the case, but if you buy it as a &#34;gift&#34; in the purchasing process, it &#34;may&#34; arrive unregistered, which would be good. I suspect Amazon ships them registered to streamline the setup by eliminating a couple of steps. ",
"Aaron Mills","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"The Echo Dot was one of those Amazon products that I thought would be cool, but did not really want to spend the money on. Then I saw a few videos that showed in controlling lights and a video that showed the future Sonos integration it will get in 2017. This really got me thinking that maybe I would pick one up. Black Friday hit, so I ended up getting two.    I placed one in my kitchen and one in my bedroom. So far, I've asked it basic questions, like weather, time, sports scores, when TV shows will be on, and so on. It did really well with all of that, but with more complex questions that I know Google Home can handle, like what sound does a whale make, it failed horribly. There were other questions like, how long will it take me to get somewhere that it can only calculate distance. So, I would say it is not as smart as Google Home or even Google Now in some aspects.    It makes up for this two different ways. The first is the number of partners Amazon has for smart home devices built right in. I decided to go all in with Wemo devices, so I picked up a couple of Wemo outlets. As of right now I have these setup on my Christmas trees and can turn them on and off with Alexa. The setup was super simple and it work amazingly well. Down the road I envision having my bedroom lights and kitchen lights all configured with Wemo devices. As of right now Google Home is still limited to just a few smart home devices, Wemo not being one of them. You would have to use IFTTT to get that to work.    The other way it makes up for it is with music. I've got a Sonos system, but find myself asking the Echo Dots to play music more when my hands are wet or I'm holding something. They sounds pretty good for their size, but I wish they could all play music at the same time. Down the road once the Sonos integration is there, that will be amazing.    Pros  - Small size allows this device to sit anywhere  - They don't cost as much as other products (like Google Home) so putting them around your house is cheaper  - If you already have a USB charging hub, you can power this with that  - Answers most questions  - Plays a variety of music with a Prime account  - Integrates easily with a ton of smart home products right out of the box  - Sonos integration coming in 2017  - Solid sounding speaker for the size    Cons  - Not as smart as Google Home  - Can't answer more complex questions like Google Now or Google Assistant can    Overall this is a solid product that I would recommend picking up, but know it does have some limitations when compared to Google products.

"David D.","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I bought an Echo Dot just to try it out and see what all the hoopla was about. About a week later I bought 3 more. I am very impressed with the voice recognition of Alexa and some of the features. Here's why:    The Pros:  - Excellent voice recognition. While there are a few times Alexa has misheard me, overall it does a really good job of understanding what I say. Even with a decent amount of background noise she has heard me to my amazement.  - Great range. We have an open floor plan home and Alexa can usually hear me just fine even when I'm about 20 ft away.  - Home automation integration. I have SmartThings hub and Alexa works awesome with this! I can turn lights on/off and run routines with my voice.  - If you have multiple Dots and more than one hears you give a command only the one that is closest will respond.  - For those with music on Amazon it gives you easy access to your library.  - While the internal speaker is not very good for music, you can add an external speaker with an Aux line or Bluetooth to make up for that. Amazon and Sonos already announced they are working on integration as well.  - You can add this to a shopping or to-do list with your voice! It's great to just add stuff as I think of it.  - The price. For $50 I think this is a great deal.    The Cons:  - As mentioned above, the internal speaker is more than adequate just for Alexa's voice, but not that great for music.  - Alexa does OK on normal internet searches, but nothing like Google.  - You cannot ask Alexa questions of context. So for example if I just asked who Abraham Lincoln was and she answers that I could then not just ask &#34;How old was he when he died?&#34; but would have to ask &#34;How old was Abraham Lincoln when he died?&#34; This makes it feel much less like a natural conversation.  - The Alexa app is pretty basic. Especially the built-in Shopping and To-Do list. They are definitely functional, but not to the level of some other list apps that are out there. I do have a feeling this will get improved in the future though.  - Alexa is definitely not like the computer from Star Trek or any Artificial Intelligence you have seen on TV. She can do good with basic stuff, but for some things you do have to &#34;learn&#34; the way to tell her to do stuff especially with the Home Automation. I once kept telling her to &#34;turn on the living room lights&#34; and she said she could not find that. Then I realized the switch was just labeled &#34;living room light&#34; and as soon as I dropped the &#34;s&#34; and just said &#34;light&#34; it worked perfectly over and over again.    Overall, I am still very happy with the Echo Dot. I think for the price it is a great deal. Maybe it will be more useful for those with Home Automation systems, but others may find it fun as well. ",
"TJ Walenski","December 5, 2016 ",4.0,"Alexa is pretty awesome, simply put. It's helpful during your daily routine, but also a hit if you have a party or friends over. My parents use the Echo in their kitchen to play music, get news updates, and whatever else.    I just bought the dot and I actually use it in my vehicle for handsfree music control. I paired it with Amazon Music Unlimited and mobile hotspot from my phone and now i can play any song, artist, or station that i want without touching my phone and without ads. No more handing my phone to the passenger to play music, flipping through 10 different stations, or dealing with sucky Pandora ads. ",
"Gary W. Powell","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I've had the Dot a few days now and have it connected to an AV receiver. It seems to have no problem hearing a command when there is no noise in the room but once you start playing music,even at a low level, you have to yell in order to get its attention. I remedied this by pairing it with a remote that has voice control. IMO the voice recognition works much better on the Echo than on the Dot. Would that keep me from buying it again? Absolutely not. Now if I can figure out how to make Alexa fetch me a beer. ",
"the Fat Man","April 13, 2017 ",5.0,"You are my everything.    Seriously she does it all. My curiosity peaks at random intervals of any day and she answers them. I enjoy the trivia, jokes, weather input so I can dress accordingly and check my commute before heading out. The top features I've been reliant on is her alarm/timer, ambient noise (paired through my Polk system is awesome), and the more practical use is linking to smart plugs so when I come in with more bags than I should be handling at once I can just tell her to turn on the floor lamp. *click* &#34;Okay&#34;.    I can sleep with ease knowing I can wake up to one of many alarms (most are pleasant, avoid the Celebrity ones) instead of an annoying buzzing or ringing. Skills allow lullaby for kids, read books, or like I mentioned earlier ~ rain, thunderstorm, ocean waves, etc. Not much is wrong with the unit except a pending Bluetooth issue which is at the time of this review post is being looked into by Alexa support. Just about anyone outside can scan for her and play their (tasteless) music through the unit and may startle you but a solution is pending. That's another thing I'd like to mention: the supporting staff are responsive within a few hours, not days. They're very professional yet casual in their messages when covering all points. It's nice to see so many products coming out (eBay has more skins!) to accessorize with but at her low-profile size and color she's fine as-is. I bought the black which is appropriate with my mancave theme: black/white with splashes of blue here and there as is the glow of her ring unless she's having an error (red) or in setup/powering on (purple and orange).    We will never argue. We respect each other's space. Too bad I can't hug ya for all your services these past months and years to come. :P ",
Shawna,"October 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Its alright. She does some cool things and once you get her app and choose what you want her to know and do voice recognition she works a lot better. Still there's times she don't understand simple things and other times she don't hear you say something that you said very clear. And a rare moment where she will ramble about odd things that have nothing to do with what you are talking about. She went on a rant about worms and angels.... But... We laugh so... Oh well lol ",
"C. E. White III","February 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Original review - It stops working and requires rebooting multiple times each day. It will not stay connected to my wireless router (I do not have problems with any other wireless device).This makes it almost worthless to me.    1/28/2017 update - I was not impressed with Amazon Alexa Support. They had no helpful suggestions for addressing the connection issue (repeated factory resets changed nothing). After a very long time on the phone with two different support persons, they finally decided to send me a replacement Dot. The replacement behaved exactly the same as the original. It also refused to stay reliably connected. This despite the fact that none of the other wireless devices in my home had similar problems.    I spent a lot of time researching Echo Dot connection problems on the internet. I am far from alone. There were many individuals with the same issue. In an attempt to solve the problems, I went so far as to buy a new router. This initially changed nothing. The Dot would randomly disconnect from the new router just has it had from the old router. One internet suggestion finally seems to have solved the connection issue. Per the suggestion, I set up a guest account on my new router that was specifically for the Echo Dot and only the Dot. After resetting the Dot and connecting it to this account, it has stayed connected.    With the connection problems hopefully solved, the Dot is now mostly an amusing toy. I have just one internet connected device it can interface with (a Nest Thermostat), so mostly I ask it random questions. I was hoping to use it to monitor my stocks, but this has been frustrating. It readily understands some company names and/or stock symbols, but there are some it just can't understand. I wish I could edit the stock list using the keyboard. Once I am more comfortable with the Dot, I may order a hub and other internet connected devices so I can use it for more home automation functions, but for now, I am just hoping it will stay connected. I have updated my rating to three stars and may update it further once I become more familiar with the Dot. ",
AdventureGirl,"April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I wanted black but it was backordered. I didn't want to wait so ordered the white. I ordered three. One for myself one for each of my nephews who kept forgetting to set the alarm, and one for my brother. You absolutely cannot beat the price. I am about to order another 4 for my mom, dad, another brother, and a friend. The part that I have become obsessed with is the alarm. My brother is incredibly good at figuring out how to use tech in ways I do not have the patience for. I sent him one so I could steal his tips and tricks. It worked. I use it for Amazon Kindle, spotify, audible, uber, to ask questions, to schedule events, and create my shopping list. Great product. It can still be a bit glitchy at times, but overall it is beyond a great value. ",
"Cliente Amazon","January 9, 2017 ",3.0,"Although Echo Dot isn't available in most of Europe, I bought one when I the US and brought it wth me to Spain where I reside. Some the Echo Dot features don't transfer, such as controlling the lights, appliances or ordering pizza from Dominos, the device really is magnificent.  If others are considering connecting the device, it's important to know that you might need to change your billing location in the Google Play Store in order to download the Alex app on your phone (Amazon and Google tech support had to walk me through those steps) and a plug adapter is necessary. The Echo Dot requires a 9 volt input, so a regular cell phone plug probably isn't adequate. The plug adapter is quite inexpensive (2.50 euros) and solves the plug problem. I then had some trouble getting Echo Dot connected to my home wifi network. I tried at a friend's house, and at work, and there wasn't any trouble, so there was something wrong with my home wifi. The Amazon support team was very helpful in trying to resolve my issue. There were lots of phone calls and troubleshooting, and I have only positive things to say about the support received. The problem was not with Amazon, or the Echo Dot; it was with my internet service provider (ISP). It turns out that different wifi channels are used in Europe than in the US. My ISP had to open up some more channels on my router in order for the Echo Dot to find my network. Once that was done, problem solved.  It's possible to change the time zone of the device, so Alexa does know the correct day and time, but the other location information has only US options (city and state). I haven't tried to change the location because I can just ask for the weather information specifying my city, and Alexa knows. I especially enjoy the connection to Amazon music (only 3.99 per month) and have connected one device to my sound bar speaker, and another Echo Dot device to a Bluetooth portable speaker so I can listen to my flash briefing (different news sources you can select in the App) while I'm getting ready in the morning. If you're considering bringing Alexa to Europe, know it's possible, but there are some adjustments necessary.    Compared to the Google alternative, the Echo Dot price can't be beat, and connecting to speakers is a great advantage. I'm sure the &#34;Skills&#34; the Echo Dot can do and Alexa's knowledge will only continue to grow. ",
"Crystal Cooper","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is my new best friend. Ok, not really, but she does answer just about anything I throw at her, and she plays me music and turns my lights on and off. It's like having the smartest butler ever working for you. Want to feel instantly pampered? Get a compatible outlet plug, and have Alexa turn your bedroom lamp on/off every morning/night. It's posh, trust me.    I'm impressed with the mic range - I can talk to her from other rooms without issues. Every once in a while, she tries to answer a question from the TV, but then we just laugh and go back to drinking wine.    I really do like the Echo - it's small, can be portable (with accessories), answers those &#34;who was it that starred in Perfect Strangers&#34; questions that pop up, and can help you substitute eggs in a recipe in a pinch.

"Anakalia - Red Herring","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My whole family has been enjoying having Alexa around.  We're constantly asking her questions.  Some helpful and some not so helpful to some that are unknown or that she can't answer or understand.  I'm sure she'll get better and better with updates in time.    From homework, to cooking, to everyday life, traffic, stores, weather, music and silliness, we've been able to turn to her for some help and entertainment.  We've uploaded some of the &#34;skills&#34; but can't seem to remember what they're all called to access them so they're not used very often.    There's been a few times that she doesn't perk up when we talk to her but other than that, even with a Bluetooth speaker not too far away, she usually hears us over some loud music.    We're planning on getting a smart hub or some other add ons to work with her but for now, she is low key and takes up minimal space.    I am still debating whether or not to get a few more.  I would love one in my room and I know a couple of people who would like one under the Christmas tree. ",

"Amazon Customer","April 8, 2017 ",1.0,"Being a previous X10 user, was looking for a better and more up to date way of controlling my lights and other devices.  Amazon Echo provided this control point at a price point that made it economical to place devices in multiple rooms.  I coupled it with the Samsung SmartThings hub and control devices from GE, Cree and GoControl as well as my Harmony device used to control my Entertainment center.  Alexa was able to recognize and control the lighting devices but for the Harmony devices you need to ask Alexa to ask Harrmony to perform an action and this appears to be the case for a lot of other add-ons where you need to remember the service name to issue a command.  My biggest disappointment was that Alexa is 100% reliant on its Internet connection and connection to the Amazon servers.  If your Internet connection is down, or the servers are down then Alexa is about as useful as lead boots at a swimming competition.  In the 4 weeks since I deployed, my Internet has been down once and the Amazon servers unresponsive making Alexa useless to control my devices or even set a wake up alarm.  Would be nice if a set of base commands were installed on the device that allowed it to function with locally connected devices without having to talk to the Mother Ship first. ",
"Rick C.","March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"This is truly an amazing little thing. I have an Amazon Echo, and both have pretty identical technical capabilities. The Dot has two big advantages -- it retails for $50 rather than $129, and it can be linked into a stereo system via bluetooth or direct cable (I use it with Bluetooth). The main disadvantage this has standalone is that the speakers are not nearly as good as the Echo's, music sounds more or less like a cheap radio, but not so much the problem when you have it linked to home system or a good bluetooth speaker. The Echo series does have many wonderful skills which you can find all about elsewhere, but I'll mention some surprising deficiencies for the series. The biggest surprise is the inability to directly wake to music. You can only wake to any of a selectable series of alarms. So they can't really replace a clock radio. They can wake you, they can play music... you can even set a sleep timer while playing music. But no music or news to awaken you. A minor annoyance for me is that though it can play Spotify playlists, you can't *shuffle* play them (the Echo ignores the word &#34;shuffle&#34; in &#34;shuffle play my 'favorites' playlist). I have a big playlist of favorite tunes which is not fun when it starts over with the same one every time. I also wish that, along with its timers and alarms, it could issue a verbal reminder of something. You can say, &#34;Alexa, set an alarm for tomorrow morning at 7:30am&#34; or &#34;Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes,&#34; but I'd love it if you could say, &#34;Alexa, set a reminder tomorrow at 7:30am that I have to go to the dentist,&#34; or &#34;Alexa, remind me to turn down the oven in 30 minutes&#34; (night before last, both of us were cooking different things and getting confused as to which of three timers was for doing what). Still, would buy again; would get for anyone on my Christmas list who isn't afraid of a little online set-up that I'd be willing to spend $50 on. ",
"Jen The Savvy Shopper","March 17, 2017 ",3.0,"Just got one.  We are so impressed and just ordered three more to place in various locations in the house. We plan to have two upstairs and two downstairs.  But the more I think about it the more I want to have one in each room upstairs, which means I might get a couple more later.    The Echo dot buy was an experimental one.  We were originally concerned about the privacy issue so didn't want to jump on it, but this appears to be the best option to add music to kids playroom so we decided to give it a try. I am glad that I can actually delete all history which addresses our privacy concern. Now talk about our spending went from the original $50 to $200 in just the 2 days, and more will come (BT speakers, battery, etc) in the near future, ha!    But I just love it!  It's brilliant. ",
"T. Bramhall","November 18, 2016 ",4.0,"I could hardly wait for my new toy to arrive.    I had ordered the Dot about a week before it came out, and the day that I received notification that it was out for delivery, I waited with eager anticipation.    I have to admit, I hate that Amazon has started using USPS more than UPS. With UPS, I'd have my package in the morning. With USPS, I don't receive it until around 4 or 5 pm. But, finally it was here and I quickly unpacked it and downloaded the app on my phone.    It took a little time to set up the app, connecting Spotify, adding a code so Alexa couldn't just order anything she heard on the TV, which I'd read was a problem with earlier versions. Once I got it set up, there was an update, but that took almost no time. Then I paired it with my Bose Soundlink Mini, a &#34;toy&#34; I'd gotten this summer.    Pairing was quick and easy, although one note I should mention is that if you pair several items (phone, computer, Echo Dot, etc.), you may have a problem when the speaker receives info from more than one connection. If the Dot doesn't seem to be working with the speaker, make sure that another device isn't also trying to play - even if your computer or phone is muted but would be making sound otherwise, it can claim priority on the speaker (my only complaint with the SoundLInk, but I mention it here because I thought my Dot was broken when I couldn't get it to play).    For the first few days, the Dot was mostly used for music. I love being able to listen to background music when I feel like it, exactly the music I want to hear at the volume I want it, and then being able to pause or stop it when I want.    But on the third day, my lights arrived. I live in an old house with weird wiring in some rooms. The overhead light in our bedroom has no switch, which makes you wonder what the people who put it in were thinking. For the first time since we bought the house, the bedroom light is actually useful. &#34;Alexa, turn on our bedroom light.&#34; &#34;Turning on our bedroom light.&#34;    All in all, for $50, the Dot is everything I hoped it would be, and I'm still just discovering its capabilities. There are additions I'd love to see (integrating with Apple apps would be wonderful), but so far I'm very impressed, and this is a device that I know I'll be using every day. ",
Heather,"April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"LOVE this product. We have Alexa paired with a number of smart switches and plugs and light bulbs in our house and being able to voice-control everything makes our lives so much easier and it feels so cool to have a smart house. Alexa plays our holiday music at our parties, can change the Nest thermostat upstairs to a more comfortable setting when we are downstairs, helps us with our daily commute by letting us know if there is traffic, and even lets me know how to dress based on the weather/outside temp info she can provide. We use her to play soothing thunderstorm sounds at night, and to catch the scores of the game if we missed it. A truly invaluable tool. I have one for my first floor and one for my second, and now a bunch of my family members are ordering them as well. The dot works perfectly well for us, and I'm not sure what differences there are between it and the regular echo, other than the speaker, but I find that the dot's speaker works just fine for our needs. We rarely have issues with Alexa understanding our commands, with the only instance when we hosted a Christmas party and there were so many voices around, I'm not sure she could easily distinguish the commands. I simply moved a little closer and spoke a little louder and more clearly and she picked up and followed the command easily. The Alexa app is constantly being updated and new skills are always being added. I now use use Alexa and the TrackR app to find my phone around the house, and Alexa can check local movie times as well. LOVE this product, and, for the price, it's truly a great buy! ",
JH,"October 31, 2016 ",5.0,"Let me start by saying that I had purchased an Echo about 2 months ago, I did not have a great experience with the Echo as it lost connection with certain songs from my Amazon prime account and Pandora.  Timers, weather, etc seemed to work ok. I had purchased at Best Buy, but even though associated with my account was unable to write a review which would have been only 2 stars.  I returned that device to BB as I am unsure if it was my internet, amazons servers or a defective device, as a note I can stream Netflix and Hulu on several devices w/o issue, however even w/o any other internet activity the Echo would stop on certain songs. I gave the device about a week and several conversations to Amazon TS w/o any improvement prior to return.    For the Echo,I had it located in the kitchen/family area. I really liked the ability to pull up the weather, set a timer, some current new on request and ability to integrate with Prime Music and Pandora. I thought the sound quality was pretty good for what it is, granted it is not a complete surround sound stereo system.  I would have kept the Echo had it not been for songs stalling.    I probably would not have purchased another Alexa device had the price been $170+ but at $50 I decided I would bite again and give it another try and am glad that I did.  It does all of the things I liked in the Echo, but does not have any dropped songs or stalls so far.  So I am going to assume something was wrong w/ the original Echo I had or Amazon ironed out some server issues.    The smaller size does allow for hiding it better, although you do still want it to be able to hear you and you it.    The sound is more than acceptable for my purposes with plenty of volume.  That said, it lacks bass compared to the Echo and you will not hear it as well if your TV is loud or a bunch of kids are over running around. I have not tried to connect it to an external speaker or stereo system.  For the casual user that just wants weather updates, the time, a timer, a little music and is not an audiophile this device is smaller and far less expensive than the echo and can perform all of the same functions as far as I know.  For the person that just wants more bass, the Echo may satisfy your needs w/o extra cables etc, but if you are really picky about sound you are still going to want to connect to a different speaker or stereo, and the dot allows that.  Also, at $50 one is not as concerned about kids playing with it or it getting knocked over etc.    At the $50 price point, if you have amazon prime I feel this is an excellent purchase.  I gave 4 stars and not 5 more for my issues I had with my Echo and Amazons customer service than for the dot itelf.  I kind of feel that the issue I had with the Echo could potentially be encountered by some w/ the Dot as I really never determined why the Echo had stall issues. ",
"Joshua Easters","December 12, 2016 ",5.0,"I got this to place on the balcony with an speaker system, and it has added such great convenience!

Chad,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"First off, you will need the speaker so buy it. I wanted to Y this off with an adapter and run both my computer and this through the same speakers, but that didn't work so I ended up buying speakers. The other issue I have is that the microphones don't seem to pick up quite as well as my Echo. Still great mind you, but I notice that several times I've had to speak up. But with Echo I don't get that.    The main flaw with Alexa continues to be its reliance on Bing as its search engine. Amazon really needs to either create its own search algorithm for Alexa, switch to Google, or at the very least allow customers (the ones that are always right) to pick which of the two they want. I've performed experiments where I've asked Alexa and not gotten an answer then used OK Google with the same keywords and gotten exactly what I wanted. A perfect example was last night. I asked when the polls closed in my state. I named the state. Alexa couldn't tell me but instead said to go to the link that it placed in my app...well...first off...that's no good because I'm asking Echo and not my phone. When I did grab my phone and asked OK Google the exact question it gave me the answer I was looking for without any issues. I'm tired of Alexa either not knowing or putting a link in the app. I can tell you now I've never, not one single time, looked at that link in the app because I don't have it with me. The entire idea of a voice activated friend in every room is to get answers whenever and wherever you want. I don't want to carry my phone around the house with me.    All that said, I still enjoy having this device. I own Echo, this echo dot, and another will arrive this afternoon (literally). So I'm not knocking the product entirely. It's massively expandable using IFTT and skills but it's core function, that of an assistant, lacks and will lack until they get better search. ",
"The Nurbler","March 7, 2017 ",4.0,"I have two of these, and the one feature I was most hoping for is described on this amazon help page https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202013740 like this:    &#34;Note: You cannot connect multiple Alexa devices to each other and play the same requested audio at the same time.&#34;    Since these things have speakers and can stream audio, it is only natural to wish that I could stream my Pandora (or other) music to all of the Echos I own at the same time, in sync.  I don't think it is the statement above that is upsetting in and of itself.  What is upsetting is that, based on that statement it appears that Amazon has no interest in even attempting to make this happen.  Why, oh why is that true? ",
Val_NYC,"November 9, 2016 ",4.0,"Good: This is the product we've been waiting for. All the internet knowledge at the tip of your fingers... just say &#34;Alexa!&#34;, she'll be there for you answering to an enormous amount of questions. Ordering stuff online, giving you the traffic info on your way to work or just the forecast, keeping your life organized.   Of course, it's hard to resist from purchasing additional components...it's so cool to be able to lay on the sofa, turn the lights on or off, operate any IR devices you might have, locking doors, closing the blinds, starting the coffee maker or controlling the temperature using your voice. It doesn't matter the light switch is next to your head or the stereo/ TV remote is right in your hand. It's the feeling that you step into a new world with huge further options to discover, it's the power to having such a powerful tool at your disposal.  And I know the developers are just warming up.  Bad: Without WI-FI all home gadgets are useless. ",

Justin,"November 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I must say this thing is pretty awesome, and fun! It does have its problems tho. At times it really does not understand me unless I stop and speak slow and close to it. It was having that problem for a solid 10mins yesterday, but after 10mins it was cool again. It seems to go haywire at times like that but not for long at all. And not that often.    I do have some problems staying connected when doing the voice training. For some reason the voice traing seems super messed up for me right now. You got thru 25 commands and for me pretty much every other command it would lose connection. Took almost 20mins to get thru the 25 commands.    It is awesome tho don't get me wrong here, i just wanted to point out it's flaws....And that is all of them :) Not too bad. and it is always improving and updating. This thing is awesome for playing my music, and pretty much just being my personal B****! :) The alarm is something I LOVE! I hate rolling out of bed and messing with my phone. Now I say &#34;Alexa STOP&#34; That's it :) The built in speaker is pretty good for a small apt. I love in a 1 bedroom apt. and it cranks. I still have it hooked up to my own speaker since its an awesome speaker I have. The built in speaker is more than enough tho for an alarm clock, timer, and music in a small apt. I also love being able to hear NFL scores so easy. &#34;Alexa, score of Denver game?&#34; Boom! It's a lot of fun.    There is a lot of stuff this thing can do. There is sooo many list of features out there that I am not going to go into that. This thing is great for someone who does a lot of multitasking. It has made my life a lot easier working from home. I would recommend it for the $50 price tag easy. It is a lot of fun to just mess around with as well. If you are looking at this and the $180 echo. There is no decision to be made. Go with this $50 echo, do not go for the Expensive one with a better speaker. You can get a better speaker way cheaper.    It does need some work, and they're doing a great job moving it along the track. I expect when the Google thing comes out it will push Amazon even more and in a years time this Echo Dot could be really, really epic for the price. ",
scummins89,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"This device is more or less a novelty period when asking questions Alexa cannot answer most things. It is difficult to get the device to work properly. I find using anything as far as a search text deep explanation and you have to be very specific to get the answers that you want. I would definitely not recommend this device until Amazon can come up with something better. I was highly disappointed and all levels. However the speaker was above average from what I could tell it surpassed my expectations. The design is also very nice I like the size and color. ",
"Janet Mac","October 24, 2016 ",4.0,"Thank you for making Alexis more affordable by offering the Dot as an option.  I haven't used it yet with a Bluetooth speaker, but I plan to.  Speaker is clear enough, but I would want to use a better speaker for music.  Paired with the Phillips Hue light bulbs, and the TP-Link smart plug, I don't have to go down stairs to turn on or off lights.  I love the convenience.  I also use it to get movie times at my favorite theater without turning on my computer or my smart phone. ",
Danny,"April 9, 2017 ",2.0,"For the price (especially the black friday price of $40) this is a great deal. I still use my original echo that I got about a year ago at least a few times a week, and I just bought two dots to play music in the shower and set alarms in my bedroom.    Since I live in an apartment often more than one echo hears me, but it's been working seamlessly that only the one closest to me (or that I am speaking in the direction of) replies.    If anyone from Amazon reads this, the feature I REALLY WANT is to give fire tv commands to my echo, e.g. &#34;play Westworld in the living room&#34;, &#34;pause the show&#34;, etc. I'm really hoping they add this ability soon, as well as other device coordination features like playing the same song on multiple echoes in multiple rooms.    A couple of other notes that might be useful for people:    - I bought the white echo Dot, but the usb cord and usb outlet adapter are black. Feels like Amazon got lazy here, why can't you make those in white too? I took away a star for this combined with the fact that it doesn't interface with the Fire TV at all.    - the speaker is good, for music it's honestly barely noticeable that it's a little worse in the lower-mid ranges than the regular echo. Where I actually notice it more is in Alexa's voice, it's just not quite as full sounding as the regular echo's voice. I was surprised that this is what stood out to me, but it almost sounds like a different person which was strange the first few times I used it.    - The volume on the dot is also good, at max volume it's probably about the same as the original echo at 8, which is higher than I ever set it.    - the usb outlet adapter is about 2 inches deep, which is bigger than I've seen in other electronic products. About twice as deep as the iphone usb wall adapter, I assume it's drawing more current and they aren't compatible but I haven't checked. On the upside, it's a standard 2-prong size, so it can plug into one of the middle spaces in a power strip and only take up one space. I guess they optimized for power strip usage instead of being able to plug it in behind furniture up against the wall. ",
"Bev Martin","December 12, 2016 ",5.0,"I purchased several of these on prime day when you could buy 4 (or was it 5) and get one free.  I now have an Echo in the main living area, a Dot in the bedroom, and a Dot in my craft room.  The others were great Christmas gifts.  The Dot works identical to the Echo except it has a much smaller speaker.  It can be connected to a blue tooth speaker, or in the case of my craft room, I have an expansive set of Bose speakers and CD player/changer (I guess it is getting a little old).  I have the Dot plugged into the Bose speakers and the sound is great. The Dot is much smaller than the Echo so in many circumstances it would be preferred over the Echo as it doesn't take up much space.  We love our Alexa(s) ",
"Allen F","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"1. I have constant connectivity problems in which the Echo Dot, while it remains connected to the internet, somehow becomes invisible to my phone and tablet. Somehow this manages to mess up my Spotify account. It took a while, but I finally figured out that I could fix this by doing a complete reset on the Echo Dot. Now, I get to do that about once a day.  2. Speech recognition lags far behind Google and even Apple. Blows my karma on a regular basis by playing heavy metal when I asked for Rachmaninov's Vocalise. Pitiful.  3. There are thousands of so-called &#34;skills&#34;, or 3rd-party apps. They are uniformly useless. Do you really want a machine that tells you jokes? ",
"Michael Bingham-Hawk","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I would theoretically like this device, however, we discovered the hard way that it eats a ton of internet data. Our only option for internet is Hughes Satellite and we have a monthly data cap of 50gb a month. We were forced to purchase multiple data add ons. I would not figure out what was eating the data. Finally, I change the Wifi network name on our router and through process of elimination discovered that the echo was sucking our data dry. Supposedly, it only uses a minimal amount of data when in idle mode. This is simply not true. ",
"Amazon Customer Elicia","April 11, 2017 ",2.0,"I wish it had a dictionary.  The &#34;word of the day&#34; is insufficient. It doesn't understand everything but hope it learns soon. Wish I could make a phone call or text with it. It's great for playing music, checking news and weather. Lots of its skills are lame. It's a great idea and I hope they expand on it soon! ",
Leedoh,"February 28, 2017 ",2.0,"Very easy to use and setup to work with other items in the house.  Within 10-minutes of turning it on I had it working with our Nest Home thermostat and Lutron Caseta lights.  Once I get our AVR setup I will also sync it with the Harmony remote to be able to control the TV/AVR through the Dot.    The kids love it from asking various questions to using the timer for study activities.  It also helps to speak more clearly.    We are exploring other skills like lists to be able to further use it.    One thing that we wished it had was the ability to sync to iCalendar as it only looks like it supports Outlook and google calendar.  I would guess though that it is probably only a matter of time before that skill is there. ",
"boB Gudgel","November 23, 2016 ",4.0,"I really like this product.  My big issue is that it is capable of SO much more !  I do believe my problem is that I do not know HOW to ask it questions properly.  I was able to have Alexa do some math as well but I am sure it can do way more if only there was an advanced &#34;how to&#34; guide to form questions properly for more complicated concepts.  I know that the server software will get better and better over time...  Also, it is nice that one can develop apps to make Alexa do more neat things.  I bought a second DOT as well as the Google Home because neither one by itself gives me the whole shebang.  If I had to choose though, I think I would choose the DOT over Google Home and NOT because it is less than 1/2 the price.  It's too bad that Amazon and Google don't like each other and Alexa won't use Google to search the web.  Works very well in spite of not doing that though. ",
"Amanda Garrison","March 23, 2017 ",5.0,"I just received this yesterday and I love it. Within an hour I had the Dot installed and the app installed and Dot connected and playing my Amazon Prime Music (I think I will upgrade to the Unlimited for the Dot, since there were songs that were that far off the beaten path that Prime Music could/would not play). Also it took me 10 minutes to install the Harmony skills for Alexa and I was operating my Harmony Hub connected equipment. I am working on getting Alexa integrated with my Homeseer HS3 soon.  I will say it is worth the time to do the voice recognition set up.  It has its limitations,  but adds convenience.  I am sure the skills and functionality will improve as time goes on. ",
Cari,"March 1, 2017 ",4.0,"I've had the larger Echo since they did the early pre-sale for Prime members years ago and love it. I got the Echo dot for my mother (late 50's but frustratingly bad with new technology) for Christmas this year. I wasn't sure if she would like/use it enough to justify getting her the bigger Alexa so I thought the dot would be a good intro. She loves it so far! I did help her set it up and show her some neat tricks, but she's been able to figure it out much more than I expected. Luckily the place that we decided to set it up in her house is near her Samsung TV soundbar so we were able to hook it up to that so it would be louder when she wants to listen to music. Her echo is about 10-15 feet from the kitchen and the Echo dot can still pick up her voice from that far when she tells Alexa to add something to her shopping list or start a timer (one of my favorite things Alexa does). I showed her some of the neat Smart home capabilities and ordered her a few TP-Link Smart Plugs because she had the old school light timers on her lamps in the living room. I left home after xmas before the plugs arrived and called her a couple days later to see if she figured out how to set up her new smart plugs and link them to Alexa and she said she had already figured it out herself! Without even calling me!! Groundbreaking.    Anyways, I think the Echo dot makes a great gift and works wonderfully as long as you don't expect it to be a full-size speaker like the regular Echo. It's easy to hook up to other speakers via headphone jack or Bluetooth, and otherwise has the same capabilities as the larger Alexa does. Since seeing the dot in my moms house, I've considered getting one for the second floor of my house since my Echo is on the first. ",
vacuumtubejazzpro,"March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"There's not much I can add that hasn't been said before, since the Echo Dot is constantly being improved, and anything I say today could be wrong tomorrow.  Mine has been especially poor for movie theater information, but I like it a lot for weather, news, radio, podcasts, and encyclopedia-type questions.  It's even really nice for background music, and seems to have nearly all albums available, including even the Beatles and Stones catalog. The sound quality of the internal speaker is hard to describe, but it's somewhere between, say, a cell phone's speakerphone and a decent Bluetooth speaker or table radio.  There's no bass at all, and little sparkle to the high frequencies, but within its limits, it presents a smooth, un-distorted sound that might exceed your expectations.  The 1/8&#34; headphone jack enables me to connected the Dot to my primary stereo system or to plug in my Shure studio monitor headphones.  It sounds great with either -- or at least as good as 256Kb/sec compressed audio can sound.  If I could add just one feature, the Dot is crying out for cell phone integration.  How cool would it be to be able to announce &#34;Alexa, Call Lilly&#34;, and be able to walk around your home hands-free while talking to your friend (as long as she's not named Alexa).  Or to have Alexa announce, &#34;Incoming call from Donald, would you like to accept?&#34; (hint, don't take the call). ",
"Old Radio Guy","March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"Fun for entertainment, but nothing more. Timer and alarm functions require an Internet connection, so if it loses connection and you had an important alarm or timer set, forget it. I have 240 mbps Internet with an Arris 1682g dual-band (AC standard) wireless router, 15 feet from Alexa. When we ask her a question sometimes an orange light appears and she says &#34;Sorry, there's no Internet connect&#34;, even though the app says she's connected. Today I asked her to set a 10-minute timer. When the timer went off, she wouldn't cancel it. When I asked her if she knew what &#34;stop&#34; meant, she gave me 4 definitions of stop. I had to unplug her for 15 seconds to cancel the alarm. With such spotty performance, I see a Warranty return sometime in her near future. ",
Lifesavr,"December 8, 2016 ",4.0,"I purchased this Echo Dot for a friend to help her experience AI for the first time.  This worked well and was easy to install.  The speaker in it is fair, but that is what it suppose to be.  I easily connected it to a higher quality bluetooth speaker and that made it sound very nice.  This provides a very inexpensive way of starting out with an AI in one's home.  I would surely purchase this item again.  I have also purchased recently the Google Home AI and surely they are different items aimed at satisfying the user needs in different ways.  The one thing I can say about the Google Home so far is that the speaker sucks.  The full Echo has much better sound quality.  I am truly excited to see how this addiction to the home AI experience affects the future of home AI experiences. ",
"Alma Narvaez","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I LOVE THIS little Echo Dot! I have the big one in black - Amazon Echo in the kitchen since it is my main area and I can hear all throughout my place. Great speakers! So convenient in the kitchen. Also I got for my birthday yesterday this small Echo Dot in white and works just as fine for a bedroom. Although it can't answer everything it answers my questions for the most part what I need it for. Great sound. Love it for music, alarm, sports score, while watching TV can ask questions about movies, actors, etc. Just love it. Yes you need it! I plan to get one for the patio as well. ",
Colin,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"It's great for what it is.  A cheap entry level solution into a &#34;home assistant&#34; or whatever you want to call it.  My recommendation is to hook it up to another speaker so the sound quality is better, as it is a truly terrible speaker that's built in - I'm sure as a reason to buy their more expensive models.    Seems to work good.  My only real complaint is that it has a few false positives, sometimes responding to the TV if audio says anything remotely close to &#34;alexa&#34;.  Granted you can change the trigger word to something else, but it's just worth noting. ",

Bobiam,"March 31, 2017 ",4.0,"I've had an original Echo for over a year.  I love the thing and I wished I had another in my master bath for news, time, weather, music to shower with, etc. but it was too big and expensive.  I was hesitant to buy the Dot because of it's tiny speaker, but was I ever surprised!!  In a smaller room such as a bathroom the speaker sounds really good and more than adequate.  This is so convenient taking my commands while my hands are wet or while in the shower, etc.  Much better than the little radio that I used to have in there.  Get one for your bathroom or a small work area.  You won't regret it. ",
Ken,"March 9, 2017 ",2.0,"The Echo Dot is hard to work with. Every time I try to talk to it, it says: I didn't understand your question. Everything in the room has to be turned off in order to give it instructions. the Volume is horrible. I have to turn it up full blast in order to hear it. You might as well use the speaker on your device because it has more volume than the echo does. I wanted to return it but I waited to long to decide if I liked it or not.  My return date was in February. It's hard to get it to pair with a blue tooth device. Anyone out there wants to buy mine, I'll make you a good deal. ",
Ceebee,"April 24, 2017 ",5.0,"The speaker is awful. I can't hear the thing if I'm in the shower even if thing is immediately next to the tub.

It's next to useless for any kind of internet search, I asked for a specific crab cake recipe and it &#34;couldn't find the answer to that question.&#34; More often than not, the thing cannot find an answer to my basic, generic questions. Also, consider buying a battery so that the device can become portable (as long as you're connected to with-fi). I'm not returning this b/ c it's not that expensive and don't want to go through the hassle. A friend said Google Home was a better choice for her. ",
"Joshua Easters","April 9, 2017 ",2.0,"I got this to place on the balcony with an speaker system, and it has added such great convenience!

Just an incredibly innovative product and I can't recommend it enough! ",
"Amazon Customer","February 14, 2017 ",2.0,"I love my echo dot - it's a great price point, inexpensive enough that I don't feel guilty buying it.  I use it the most for time, timers, stopwatch, weather, shopping list, music and to find my phone.  I have also paired it with a TP Link so that i can turn my bedside table light on/off instead of getting out of bed and walking across the room when i'm ready to go to bed or need a light at night.    If it wouldn't be for the stupid skills that need to be enabled for every little thing, it would be 5 stars.  But who wants to find skills and then have to recall the name so that you can direct Alexa to use that skill.  Bad move Amazon.  If (when) google voice provides an entry price point for their Google Home line, the only advantage Alexa will have is ordering off Amazon. ",
"Billy B","March 7, 2017 ",5.0,"I was a very early adopter of the original Echo and wrote Amazon how they needed an Echo device that allowed Bluetooth OUT or wired audio OUT.  Yet I sat on this little gem without ordering one for a long time.  Finally pulled the trigger and am very glad I did.  Great device to hook up to your home audio system or Bluetooth speakers.  I have mine on a Bose Wave Radio in the Bedroom.  It's an amazing device that is my alarm clock, music and news source, and music entertainment.  It's simply amazing. ",
"David Ashley","March 27, 2017 ",3.0,"I ordered four of these as gifts, at about $40 each (on sale).  At the time I ordered, I already owned two Amazon Echos.    These have most of the significant functionality of the Amazon Echo, but at a far lower price.  Functionality included:  WiFi, 7 microphones with very good voice recognition, LED ring with many segments (a pretty good light show), speaker.  Functionality not included:  won't function as a Bluetooth speaker, does not have volume adjustment ring (has buttons instead).    I was very pleased.  Out of a slightly-larger-than-a-hockey-puck-sized device, I expected terrible sound.  But the sound is completely adequate, both in volume and quality.  It is perfectly adequate for listening to music in your kitchen or listening to audiobooks in your bedroom.  It is louder and clearer than I expected (but of course not as good as the Echo).  And of course since it has audio output (AUX plus Bluetooth), you can really crank up the volume with the right secondary device.    Amazing functionality at that price point.  Amazing sound from something roughly the size of a hockey puck.    This device is five stars, especially at the $40 or $50 price point. ",
