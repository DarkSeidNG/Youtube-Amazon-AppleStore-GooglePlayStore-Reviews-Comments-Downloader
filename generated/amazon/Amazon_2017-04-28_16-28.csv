nycebo,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I've been wanting an Eero for a long time, ever since it was first announced. The idea of having a mesh network just sounded so appealing. By the time that I finally got around to buying one, a couple of competitors had popped up. The most promising of them is the Luma. So, I actually bought both mesh routers and will proceed to review and compare them here (a copy of this review will be posted on both the Luma and the EERO product pages).    DESIGN  The Eero hardware is really awesome. As others have mentioned, it looks like something that Apple would design. Very glossy white and sleek looking. The routers are small squares that lie flat and have power and network cables coming out the back. There's also a USB, presumably for NSCs or printers. Eero also gave extra thought to maximizing radio antenna efficiency: the tops of the routers are modestly rounded to prevent users from putting glasses or other items on top of them (and thus obstructing strong signal).    The Luma hardware is pretty nice also. Actually, the honeycomb is pretty handsome on a bookshelf and I like that it comes in different colors. BUT, and this is a big bug, the Luma is meant to stand on edge. And, when the power and network cables are plugged in, it's unsteady. This doesn't matter too much if your first router is in the fiber closet, but it'll fall over somewhat often out in the open and look the eyesore.    Edge to Eero.    SETUP  I have Verizon FIOS fiber running at my home. Setup was pretty easy as I just plugged one end of a network RJ-45 cable into the ONT and then the other end directly into the &#34;first&#34; router. Luma apparently also allows for ethernet backhaul, but Eero doesn't at present. Regardlees, I don't use that feature so it's not relevent to me. Moreover, I doubt most buyers of this product will use it either. Anyway...    The Luma was set up first. Things went pretty smoothly. I downloaded the app from Android Play store and created an account with username and password. Remember to log into your old router and release the IP address for your ISP. Then I just followed the instructions on the app: powered down the old router, powered down the ONT (aka modem), plugged the network cable into the ONT and the Luma hub, and then plugged them both in. The Luma app on my Google Nexus 6P found the hub immediately, named it and asked me to sit patiently while it registered on the network. Sadly, that never happened. I tried one more time...no go. A quick search online revealed that some Android devices have difficulty. So, I tried setup with my Google Nexus 9 tablet and voila! It registered and I had wireless network. For the next two hubs, I used an old iPhone and things worked very smoothly also. So, perhaps it just didn't like my Nexus 6P. Small bug but no harm done.    The Eero set up was also smooth....after I figured out how to release my IP address on the Luma (see below). Basically, I had to power down the ONT and wait a couple hours. Once I did, setup with my Nexus 6P was quick this time round. Again, I downloaded the Eero app and created an account by entering my telephone number and then entering a 6 digit SMS code. The Eero hub was named, registered and had live internet. Good to go.    I'll call this a tie despite the Nexus 6P hiccup with Luma. But if you have a Nexus 6P and want to use a Luma, be prepared to need to try a different device for setup. If you're a stickler, edge to Eero.    THE APP INTERFACE  Right off the bat, both Eero and Luma apps are sparse. If you're used to configuring a wireless router in the past,  you will be unpleasantly surprised by the absence of desired features, including dynamic DNS, QoS, IP release, etc. However, I recognize that these devices are supposed to be family friendly and that they are. Following the instructions in both apps is super easy and very efficiently and quickly gets the first wifi puck up and running. NOTE: I must emphasize that the Verizon FIOS ONT needs to release the IP address in order to switch routers. If you don't release it, then you need to sit around for 2 hours with it powered down until does so automatically. This shouldn't affect most users who just buy either the Luma or the Eero. But, if you are planning on testing a couple devices, it's wise to remember.    Anyway, at this point, both apps look very similar and clean with their router status view, upload and download speeds and devices attached tab. Furthermore, they let you add new routers to the mesh network easily, name them (although Eero allows for custom names), reserve IP addresses (in advanced settings menus), enable port forwarding, assign wireless devices to a user profile, UPnP, etc. Here's where they differ:    The Eero app allows devices to be nicknamed (a super nice feature), allows for a custom DHCP, and allows DNS config if you want to use Google or OpenDNS or whomever.    The Luma can't do any of those at present. However, it does allow for IGMP Snooping to be enabled or disabled. Luma also offers a rating filter for all or specified users. I don't know what the movie-like ratings mean but it would seem handy if I had young kids to whom I wanted to restrict content.    In the end, they are both pretty similar. If I had to give one an edge, it would be the Eero simply because it allows nicknames for device connections. I dig that.    Minor edge to Eero.    SIGNAL  Okay, a lot of words to get to the part that matters most. How is the signal? Alas, this is really hard to quantify. Basically, I walked around all of the rooms in my home with the Wifi Analyzer app and took readings. On average, the Eero was about 2-5 db better than the Luma in each room. Having read some reviews online, perhaps it has to do with the extra 5Ghz antenna. Who knows? But, it was a pretty minor discrepancy and may have had more to do with how the hubs hand off the connection to one another (or don't) than actually signal strength. I will say this, BOTH Eero and Luma very capably covered all corners and rooms of my home. That alone is a tremendous victory compared to my sad history with range extenders that just never satisfied us at all.    So, minor edge to Eero but very satisfactory marks to both.    THROUGHPUT  After writing the above, a big surprise here. No bones about it but the Luma just clobbered the Eero. I have no explanation for this, especially after Eero's signal advantage. Basically, my devices would connect to the Eero hubs admirably and all looked well, achieving 120% of my Verizon FIOS bandwidth. But, after an hour or so, throughput would just plummet to about 10-30%. Badly. It made me crazy. Browsing was bad. Streaming was very difficult. My wife (who doesn't care about these tests at all) would complain and ask what I was doing to the network. I ensured that I was running the latest version but it didn't seem to resolve anything. I power-cycled everything. No success.    The Luma, on the other hand, functioned well. It would test at 100-120% of my FIOS bandwidth and almost always stay there, even if I ventured to far corners of the apartment. It made streaming on multiple devices, browsing, downloading, and music MUCH nicer than I have ever had in the past. And, the wife didn't complain. All is not rosy though. With some music sources, Luma needs a little attention. Sonos (Pandora and TuneIn Radio) ran into buffering pauses every so often. I'm hopeful that they can resolve this soon.    So, I don't have a good answer for why this was the case...especially since a lot of other users have raved about Eero. Perhaps the signal just doesn't steer my devices to the faster frequency connection. Candidly, even the 2.4GHz shouldn't have an issue. It was just curious.    Edge to Luma. But remember that you might not have this experience and I wasn’t going to waste more than a weekend trying to nail down the issue.    PRICE  Because of the intro pricing for pre-ordering the Luma, it was $250 cheaper for me than the Eero. These devices are already pricey compared to traditional routers so it matters.    Edge to Luma.    FINAL RESULTS  Here's the rub, since Luma cost much less and functioned better, I just ended up keeping it. Yes, the little hexagons aren't as aesthetically pleasing but I can't have complaints about video quality on Netflix and Amazon Prime. Since we don't have cable, HD streaming is very important. So, while others have had good success with Eero, I just can't affirm their experiences. Unless you have extensive streaming requirements or network throughput needs, I think that Luma should suffice nicely. And for the price, it's a no brainer...even if it is only $100 less than the Eero now.    But, and it's a big but: both manufacturers really need to keep stepping it up in development. The apps and features are way too vanilla at present. Good signal and performance will only get you so far with more advanced users.    EERO (3 stars)  LUMA (4 stars) ",
"eero Support","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Fantastic and game changing.  I have a large old brick home that requires internet on three floors.  Here is a list of the wireless routers that I purchased in the last three years and that did not work to provide reliable wireless in our home: (1) Airport Extreme (2) Netgear N900 Wireless Router, (3) Linksys EA9200.  In a failed attempt to make these three different wireless routers work I also added a Netgear range extender and used an Securfi Almond as a wireless range extender.  None of these combinations provided reliable wireless internet throughout our home.  Sometimes everything would work and sometimes some devices would get kicked off the network and could not login without rebooting everything.  The range extenders often did nothing.  Before I purchased eero, I was unplugging and restarting my modem and router at least once a day. Even at its best, I could never reliable get devices to work that required a reliable and strong wireless connection. In particular,  I have 5 Nestcams that would rarely stay connected for a full day. They require a very strong and reliable wireless connection to work.  Also, WiFi calling on my AT&T iPhone does not work unless it has a strong 5ghz wifi connection which I never was able to achieve consistently in my home.  I have approximately 30 different devices connected to our network at any time (5 iPhones, 2 iPads, 2 apples TVs, 1 Roku, 1 iMac, 2 MacBook Air's, 8 Sonos speakers, 5 Nestcams, 1 Peleton bike, 2 printers, 2 backup hard disks etc.) and in order to get all this stuff, I had to hard wire as many of them as possible directly to ethernet because wifi was never reliable enough.    eero has changed everything.  It took less than an hour to set up 3 eero units.  Everything worked on it immediately (Note: you have to restart your modem as instructed and unplug an restart any ethernet switches).  We have wifi in every corner of every floor of our house.  Every Nestcam has worked continuously without fail and I have full wifi calling on my iPhone.  The eero app (which is fantastic) lets me check the status of my network from anywhere and has shown 60mbps of download speed, 5mbps of upload speed and all three eero units online since the moment I plugged them in. My family has never been happier.    ps If anyone wants any of the routers or extenders the eero system replaced, let me know and I will send them to you for free (picture attached).    Update as of June 26, 2016: since the day I set eero up in April, I have never touched it. I have never had to reboot it or restart it. I have never lost internet connectivity for a minute. No other router I have had has worked like this. ",
"Mr. Truth","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Feb 8, 2017 update:  They just released the 2.2.0 firmware update yesterday.  It is supposed to have fixed delays in switching access points when roaming, down to something like 50ms, among other things.  This problem affected people using WiFi calling on Apple devices, where the call might drop if moving about.  Also, I did notice streaming apps would lose connection when the connection dropped.  It does appear to be better, but have yet to extensively test, but support page feedback looks very positive.  They do update firmware every month or two, and actively post on their community and reddit pages.  One positive I want to mention is that streaming performance outside, where I used to have serious issues by the pool, appears to be much better now than with my old (but recent) Apple router, even though the main node is placed in the same room as before (and is closest to the pool).  Looking forward to seeing how well this works this summer.  So while there are cheaper options out there, this does have very good customer support and a much more mature product than something like the Google WiFi.  Also noticed that Wifi signal is unaffected while a microwave oven is on--I was able to stream on my phone while sitting right next to it, which is a pleasant surprise.  One more thing.  Be wary of critical reviews containing outdated info, especially the featured ones here.  Firmware updates move quickly (for the networking space), so you should really go to the Eero community support or reddit pages to get the most current feedback so you don't pass over the product due to negative reviewers who won't update/remove their reviews because they'll lose their up votes.    Original:    This replaced an Airport Extreme and 2 Airport Express extenders. One issue with the old setup is that when moving around the house, devices would stay locked with degraded unusable connections for too long and not switch. Another is that I needed to get streaming to work flawlessly because I am planning to add multiple Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera 2 pack. Once I added a Skybell HD I could see issues because that device gets bogged down an unreliable without a very robust WiFi signal. While moving the Express around helped, I could still see the signal strength fluctuate even when connected to it, just located on the other side of the wall. Also, with one Nest cam streaming continuously, there would be hiccups with that stream when the Skybell was also recording. All these issues seem to have disappeared since installing the Eeros, and now I've ordered another two Nest cams and upgraded the Skybell to use full 1080 video instead of degraded 480 or 720 options.    Installation was very very easy. I mean not a single issue with the Eeros themselves, but I did disable/enable Wifi on two Macs and reboot of a Slingbox 500. I appreciated that they allow you to do configure some advanced networking features, and while there does not appear to be user configurable QoS yet, their web page says there is a basic implementation in place, and that they may offer more capabilities.    Even if you don't buy this mesh networking product, most people would be better off with one over a traditional router because these vendors are actively competing on features and performance with aggressive firmware updates, and the only thing a tradition router will get is a once in a blue moon security update. On that note, I would discourage people from an Orbi, since that appears to be a gussied up Netgear with the latest specs. Once you take a look at the browser configuration interface, it will be very familiar to anyone who has had a Netgear router, devoid of any imagination or cutting edge features or modern interface. No useful info about clients offered. At least for the Eero, I could not find a single review claiming the routers needed periodic rebooting, as we are all accustomed to, even with the Apple products (though better than Dlink or Netgear routers).    Eero is the one recommended by Leo Laporte, as I saw on his feed, though since Eero is a sponsor, objectivity could be compromised. I was seriously thinking about the Amplifi since the router itself is uber cool, but I had issues with the very large satellites and their orientation, as well as a number of reviews suggesting things like poor performance or quality control issues. One thing that sold me about the Eero is their claim that their implementation performs active routing, as you will see on the blog post explaining the TrueMesh technology. So if one node is busy, it can reroute traffic to another, which makes these satellites behave more like routers actually employing an active routing protocol. From speaking with Amplifi tech support, I was not convinced that the roaming functionality would work seamlessly, but I can't speak from first hand experience. While I might buy and try still, so far I'm content with the Eeros.    Let me say that some of the earlier reviews, say pre-Nov 17 2016, do not have the benefit of using the 2.x firmware. I fully expect many reviews addressing performance as a concern are out of date since they don't reflect current reality. My unit shipped with 1.2 firmware, and once I updated to 2.1, the WAN throughput doubled from 55Mbps to 110Mbps, my ISP limit. I may pay another $10 per month to upgrade my ISP speed once I get enough Nest cams to tax my upper limit (11Mbps) on the upload. From the Nest webpage, each cam at 1080p uses 450 Kbps (0.45 Mbps) upload on average, and 1.2Mbps max, so really I should be well under the ISP max with a number of camera streaming. The 802.11ac protocol, used by the Eeros, supports 1.3 Gbps, or 1331 Mbps, so for anyone curious, the protocol between the Eeros should have more than ample room to support numerous 1080 streams, plus a 4K stream with ease.    Upgrading firmware was easy--I just pushed the option in the IOS app to upgrade, and it proceeded to upgrade all three devices. Even those with recent purchases may not have taken the initiative to update the firmware, so that is something to consider when reading reviews since most people don't report what they are using.    I did seriously consider the Google Wifi, but was concerned about the immaturity and lack of any advanced features. It might work for average users, but for instance, from what I read you cannot even specify a preferred subnet. While perhaps that might change with future updates, with the Eero you get a maturing product, versus a very new Google product. The one concern I have with Eero is the high price.  I guess you would want to buy this if you want superior customer support with a lot of attention placed on advancing the product's capabilities.  And probably because it is, at this point, more mature than a number of recent offerings.    One thing that bothered me before purchasing was the lack of line of sight that they recommend. My primary router is in a corner room, and not central in the house, and invariably goes through drywall covered walls. I was researching Power over Ethernet to use a a backhaul to the Eero satellites, but decided to setup and test without POE. So far, I can say I don't see a reason I will ever need to use POE with these existing two satellites. One issue with what I found on POE products offered on amazon is that I would be worried about periodic rebooting and troubleshooting of those devices. So my advice for anyone similarly concerned about line of sight is to try it naked first and figure out a way to place within rooms that minimizes obstructions. Obviously, anyone with Cat 6 interior cabling already installed would want to use that.    Apr 2017 update:    Every few weeks my 2009 iMac goes off Wifi with these eeros and will not reconnect and requires a reboot.  The other Apple products seem OK, so I don't know what is going on, and I haven't had a chance to get support to intervene on this yet.  At this point, that is my only gripe about these. ",
Entrope,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"We have a fairly large home and property where we need wifi in almost every section of the property for everything from Apple TV's to security cameras.  We have literally spent thousands of dollars attempting to make the wifi signal be reliable within our home, on the grounds of the property, and within other structures on the property. Some of the solutions worked (albeit usually temporarily), but the solutions that did work required the services of our computer technician to install and/or fix. That being said, that has grown increasingly expensive as a simple reboot of the system if anything did go hay wire generated a bill from the IT company. In a last ditch effort before hard wiring the entire property, we tried eero.  In less than 30 minutes, we had the entire property up and running on eero WITHOUT THE NEED FOR THE IT COMPANY!!!  We hardly ever write a review, but I felt compelled to do so for this product.  I can't say enough about the quality and SIMPLICITY of the product!!!  Buy it.  You won't regret the decision!!!!! ",
"Andy B.","February 8, 2017 ",5.0,"This system has worked incredibly well.  It is certainly not cheap, but it seems to be a case of getting what you pay for: excellent performance and fast set up.  Setup relies on a simple iPhone app and was super simple.  The network performance has been flawless and fast.  However, two important notes: (1) it takes a couple days for the network to optimize itself, so be patient - mine was pretty fast out of the box, but a friend's eero network (in a taller house) improved by nearly 3X over the course of about 48 hours (2) you have to do the latest software updates for the best performance. Below are the performance numbers for my old Airport Extreme, followed by the eero without a patch and then the eero with the patch. ",
"Occasional Reviewer","August 21, 2016 ",5.0,"I'm am geek without all the knowledge so keep that in mind when you read this review.  I have tried everything to get wifi to reach all part of my house.  My office is in the back so the router would not put off enough signal at 50 feet away to work my iPhone.. randomly came across this product thanks to the geek squad installing my new microwave.. free advice I'll take it.    Do not let the price scare you! The upstairs portion of my house is almost 2000sq feet with a fireplace and wall in the middle. I have 4 eero's set up in 4 part of the house and I absolutely love it    Set up is a breeze with the app and it even tells you if the location you picked will not work. Just to give you an idea on my wifi speed, I was getting 49mb in my car. About 50 feet from the box in the kitchen.  79mbs in certain parts of the house and 30 mb in the basement.    I run kodi on hd, Apple TV, the wife finally loves me again now that she can use her laptop in the living room.    There are cheaper options but I've learned my lesson. Definitely worth the buy ",
"carlton marshall","December 26, 2016 ",5.0,"review 12/17/16    Eero with three access points function at least as well as three separate access points (any brand) on the same SSID.  I wired all three of my eero units to wifi in order to handle the &#34;backhaul&#34;.    The fundamental problem with this setup:  Apple devices such as iphone 6s and the late 2016 macbook pro with touch bar (absolute latest devices available from Apple) do not handoff from one eero to another without dropping connection.  The handoff from access point to access point varies from 1 to 10 seconds depending who knows what.  You WILL DROP VOIP CALLS or IPHONE/IMUSIC/AIRPLAY streams during handoff.  It is NOT ANY different in performance compared to having multiple airport express access points.    If all you want is more broad coverage of wifi, any number of solutions will be feasible. If you want SEAMLESS transition, I would say NOTHING exists that is perfect at this time.    Apple has no way of knowing how many access points you have and it clearly does not scan or actively trade access points until your bandwidth drops into oblivion and you lose connection first.  Even then, the handoff is way too slow to reconnect.    It is possible in addition that the foam insulation in my house is causing more radio reflections and slowing things down even further.  But that makes my point even more important:  the challenging house is where you would want an eero to work... and that's exactly where it won't.    People seem to have reported poor results in other wifi discussions with apple products in terms of handoff between access points.  Unless devices are actively scanning with a second wifi antenna and pre-connecting, you won't get the desired results.  Another option might be if a device was connected to two signals at once.    I am going back to me centrally placed asus router so that I can do Iphone over wifi with AT&T since my cell reception sucks in my house.  I lose some phone coverage at certain corners of my house, but this is something I am going to have to live with.  I suspect nothing important will change in my house until wifi technology moves towards a true mesh network at some point.    SEAMLESS HANDOFF is what we are looking for Eero and Apple.  Eero is falsely advertising until this can be done.  Eero bears responsibility for not warning the average user that their product won't work with all clients.  I am clearly not the average user and so I was able to figure out that this is not going to work no matter how much I screw around with it.    I gave this 3 stars but I should have been much more harsh for wasting half my day on this nonsense.  I am curious how many people who installed an Eero are predominantly just on one AP and therefore are reporting good results.  If someone has any further theories, I am willing to hear them... ",
Kishore,"November 4, 2016 ",5.0,"We tired many different routers, including adding access points or signal boosters and nothing worked. The router is on the 3rd floor of our home. The wi-fi was okay up there but on the second floor where the Xbox and iPads are, it was terrible.    It took 10 minutes to install three eero units, and we were getting 150mbps almost immediately. Throughout the entire house.    The reason I give this review only 4 stars instead of 5, is that it took about 48 hours for the speeds to remain constantly high. We'd go from 150mbps to &#60; 5.  Support suggest constantly power cycling the eero units and my modem, which does help, but I shouldn't have to power cycle so often.    It's been a week and speeds are consistently high. The eero units upgrade their firmware in about 24 hours. Most of the issues you will read on here and other forums are related to the very early release before they updated the firmware.    It's expensive, but it was worth every penny.  Could we have probably found a cheaper and simpler solution, possibly but these are good looking and elegant and just work.  Reminds me of Apple in a way.    I've attached an image from fast.com of our wireless speeds. We pay for 150mbps from Xfinity and as you can see our wireless is faster than what we're even paying for. ",
"Jack Marchetti","December 17, 2016 ",3.0,"Let me start by saying that I normally don't write many reviews on products, nor do I put my name on them.  However, this is one that I will make an exception for.  I absolutely love the eero systems that I have bought.  And just so you know, I went with the 2 pack to get started.    You really can't ask for a more simple setup process.  Simply plug your first eero device into your modem/router and then follow the steps on your mobile app.  Adding a second eero was even easier.    In case this helps you with your decision to by, the current house these 2 devices are covering is around 2500 sq. ft and 2 story.  I have one eero upstairs in the media room and one downstairs in the living room.  These 2 cover the entire house with no issue and I can even get coverage out into the front and back yards.    I've been in IT for many years and appreciate being able to just set eero up and then forget about it.  Occasionally I'll receive an email saying my devices have been updated to improve security and performance.  Thank you for that!  Last thing I want after working a full day is to come home and have to worry about updating firmware on my wireless devices.    If you are a huge techie and want every single wireless or network option/feature to play around with then this may not be the device you are looking for.  But if you are looking for a stable, quality product that does everything it needs and then some, this is a great purchase!  A bit pricey yes, but well worth it in the long run! ",
"Shawn H.","June 15, 2016 ",4.0,"I purchased the 3 pack in July 2016 and I've had absolutely no issues with them whatsoever. I cannot say the same for the&nbsp;NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Dual Band Wi-Fi Gigabit Router (R7000) with Open Source Support. Compatible with Amazon Echo/Alexa&nbsp;that I purchased in January 2015 and its companion, the&nbsp;NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Desktop WiFi Range Extender (EX7000-100NAS)&nbsp;purchased in June 2015. At the time, I thought I was out of my mind spending $400 on the eero Home WiFi System (it would've been $500 at the time, but Amazon offered a promo of $100 off), especially considering the amount of money I had already spent on the Netgear Nighthawk equipment. While the Netgear equipment provided fast throughput, I clearly decided 6 mos after purchasing the router that I needed an extender. Also, by 2016 I was experiencing dropouts all the time to the point that I routinely had to cycle the router nearly every day. I could not for the life of me figure out what was going on w/the Netgear router. I was so frustrated that I simply had to try the eero Home WiFi System. To date, I've had no dropouts; no need to cycle power - the eero simply works and is frustration free. I have one in second floor my home office, one in my upstairs bedroom, and the third in a cabinet (supposedly a no-no re: reception) that house my gaming systems, DVR, etc. There are currently 23 connected devices including 2 desktops, 3 laptops, 2 tablets, 3 cell phones, 4 Sonos speakers, 3 streaming devices, 3 Arlo cameras, 1 Ring doorbell camera (which prompted the purchase of the Netgear Extender), multiple Hue lightbulbs, etc. etc. When needed and in use, everything that is on my network works and works well. I never experience buffering issues when streaming music or TV. Web pages load quickly and multiplayer gaming is lag free. I also have a strong signal in my front and back yard! (I'm using this with Comcast Blast Plus!I also like that they are low profile and simply elegant compared to the beastly size and unattractive look of my old Netgear equipment (currently housed in a drawer until I figure out what to do with them). The only draw back I can think of is that there is only one ethernet port. However, that problem is easily solved through the purchase of an ethernet switching device such as the one I purchased for roughly $10:&nbsp;NETGEAR 5-Port Fast Ethernet 10/100Mbps Switch (FS205).  Oh - and I initially had an issue in which I had a problem getting eero to work with my employer's VPN and customer support was quick, friendly and solved the problem. That was the one and only problem I've had with these. All in all, If you're looking for a hassle free solution to router/WiFi issues and you don't mind that you're not going to be able to tweak various settings like QOS, then the eero system is the way to go. Frankly, I don't miss looking at or tweaking the various settings on Netgear's software - I really don't have a need to with the eero since it works as expected. Which is to say that the eero Home Wifi System exceeded my expectations and was definitely worth the expense in order to achieve hassle free WiFi throughout my home (including the yard, attic and basement). Highly, highly recommended. ",

"J. Mangan","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"My long time network configuration - an Apple Time Capsule with Apple Airport Expresses as network extenders finally had to be &#34;retired&#34; because network performance was becoming inconsistent. It served me well for years; however, I could never get a solid wifi signal throughout my home, nor the performance throughput I was paying for with Comcast.    Got tired of my wife complaining about as the signal degradation the past year. Watch the Eero video on their web site.....it is spot on. I was doing everything the guy in the video was doing. I purchased Eero's products, because I didn't want to deal with a non-consumer friendly, poorly designed, and less than stellar performance networking solution. I did look at competing mesh networking products, but chose Eero for the favorable customer experience.    Set-up was as easy as everyone has written about. Just plug the devices in as instructed, and everything was recognized by their iOS app. Took a few minutes on my devices were all online. I kept my same network name as my old one and the same network password, so all my devices were recognized.    Only task I had to do was update the firmware. The firmware update done via their iOS app and the network worked perfectly after upgrade. The only extra thing I did was assign a unique name to every device on my network. I did not care if I didn't have all the configuration parameters like I did with my Apple set-up, because I never used the overly technical settings to begin with.    I now have 17 unique devices on the network with no reported problems. This includes one Nest thermostat, three Nest smoke alarms, one Apple time machine network drive, two iPads, two iPhones, one Apple TV, one Amazon Fire stick, one Apple iMac, one Apple MacBook Pro, and a five others for good measure. No lags, no offline conditions, etc. It appears to just work.    Observations:    - Easy to install and set-up.  - Eero constantly improving their software and features. Very easy to see how committed they are to making this a best in class product.  - iOS app is straight forward. No bloated app design. They keep it simple and clean. No way to get lost in it.  - App allows you to turn off the device indicator light.  - Covers my two-story home with consistent high throughput wifi coverage.  - Responsive customer service. When one of my devices failed after 48 hrs. I called Eero and got a live person who spoke English...they shipped a replacement device immediately. All I had to do was return the defective device in the package with pre-paid shipping label. Easy.  - Easy online Help information. Again, information is easy to find/search for, well composed, and offers easy to follow instructions.  - Delivers a consistent and available connection across my 2200 foot two story home. Check out the awesome performance I am getting in the picture I posted.    Misc.    - One satellite device failed after 48 hrs, but Eero replaced it immediately (thank you Eero).  - When checking the wifi performance via the iOS app, it is not clear how the network speed results are determined. It would be nice know which device it is testing the network throughput from. When I test with Speedtest.net, I get a totally different network performance number. I don't know why. Maybe another user can enlighten me. I did notice when I check the network speed on multiple devices with the Eero app....they all activate. Interesting, no issue on that, just my curiosity why?  - I wish the devices were smaller in footprint like the Apple Airport Express.    No showstoppers, a positive customer experience, and my wife is happy with her husband again.    Thank you Eero, keep up the good work! ",
sp,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"THIS. IS. THE. VERY. BEST. period.    I could just stop there. We've had trouble with internet FOREVER. I can't remember a time when we didn't have to literally restart our modem multiple times a day. (Old house - plaster walls, multiple levels etc.)  I had tried everything.  Multiple power lines.  Multiple routers and wifi and extenders, etc.  Then I read about mesh networks.  And did my research.  Wow.  My life has changed !! Eero is amazing.  Easy to set up.  Easy to use.  Easy to monitor when set up.  AND THE BEST PART ... I HAVE NOT RESTARTED MY MODEM SINCE WE GOT IT OVER A MONTH AGO.  And the signal strength is POWERFUL...and reaches all of our trouble spots without any trouble.  LOVE IT. THANK YOU EERO. THANK YOU THANK YOU !!! ",
Booknut,"March 27, 2017 ",5.0,"Let me make it very simple, I have been in the tech industry since the invention of the Apple and have installed and used every type of wireless router and extender. Eero was the easiest to install of any I have used and solved the problem I had of getting consisted strong signal through every corner of my house and basement, where I have my office, even with the modem located two floors above. I purchased the 3 unit solution. Finally, my signal strengths and speeds allow me to do everything I want at any location on the 7 devices (including an Echo) I use. I also love the ability to add guests to my system without giving them my main password. ",
"Stuart Siegel","January 3, 2017 ",5.0,"OK, check my past reviews and see no raving about anything. This was phenomenal!  Best product ever!  No instructions, uses a IOS app (I'm sure there is an android equivalent).  If I had a normal situation, I would have been up and running in 5 minutes. My situation was challenging, because I get a very bad/no service signal on my cell phone without my ATT microcell which comes over the wifi network. So when I tried to do the install which begins with the router off, I would constantly loses cell service which halted the install. I was halted hundreds of times but eero kept remembering where I was and eventually completed the install. Now I have faster wifi then ever before and the same throughout my 2200 sq ft house. I have 3 eeros and I might have been OK with just 2 units. Love this thing!  I have watched this product for a year wondering if it was worth the price, and it is- and more so with the $100 price reduction. I am a FAN! ",
"K. Kwan","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have purchased the 2 units packaging but since most reviews are posted here so I am posting mine here as well. I got this two days ago and it worked great right off the bat, I got pretty good signal in one area my old router was given me problem.  Anyway that did not last, end of day one my wireless printer was not working and somehow I could not even join the network.  I tried restarting the printer several times but the printer just could not find the network at all.  So i tried rebooting my eeros and at the end deleted my entire network and started over over again.  The printer was working but my second eero just refused to be connected to the main one even it was sitting next to each other.  It kept telling me my second eero was out of range in bad placement while they were next to each other.  I tried to restart, and also completely reset the eero by using the reset button at the back, still not working.  At the end i had to switch the main and the slave units and it finally worked again.  Good thing just don't last, the next day i saw my network just disappeared for like a minute and kicked all items off.  At the end I just returned them as I don't think this product is ready for prime time.  Also if you notice there are a lot of positive 5 starts reviews by &#34;NON verified&#34; buyers so you know they are trying to bump up the ratings.  Just my opinion. ",
"eero Support","November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"These appear to have resolved a problem of spotty wifi around my house.  Set up was very easy.  The only problem I had was that after getting these set up, they auto-updated the software and the app got frozen -- although the eeros themselves were working.  I finally deleted the app and reinstalled it and everything has been good since then.  I am surprised that I do get an occasional message when trying to use my iPad and my Apple TV, both in the same room as an eero, telling me that the signal is too weak.  There is a clear line of sight between all three devices and the Apple TV is close to the eero but a bit lower.  I'll experiment a bit with placement and assume this will be resolved.  Regardless, I would recommend these because of the design, ease of set up and blanket coverage elsewhere in my house. ",
wsconn1,"April 22, 2016 ",3.0,"Finally found a solution to an almost impossible building with thick concrete and steel walls, where nothing else had covered our whole condo unit (or anyone else's).  No extender and fancy router had worked well. Now have coverage in all rooms, and iPhone gets wifi all over too, a boon since the cellular coverage was spotty at best.  And quite simple to install.  Only challenge was trying to figure out a way to get units to be roughly in sight of each other, which I did. ",
"Allan Cohen","April 9, 2017 ",4.0,"This new technology is as good an improvement as I could have hoped for.  I have Comcast high speed internet, very fast and I use the latest Apple Airport Extreme for my router.  We have a large house (3700 square feet) and we have many bad spots with poor speed.  For example my Apple Macbook Air in our kitchen sometimes is as slow as 2-5 mbps, while if I put the laptop next to the router (which is upstairs) I can get 100-175 mbps.  I also noticed that Apple has announced they are getting out of the router business--that suggested to me they realize their technology isn't keeping up and perhaps they don't want to invest in this area.  So I bought the 3-pack Eero and set it up, total time probably 20-25 minutes.  I chose to sort of triangulate my house, two units upstairs at each end of the house and one in the kitchen.  Despite the fact that Eero says it may take 24 hours to get up to full speed I am getting 125-175 mbps everywhere---yeehaa!  My Facetime to London was better and my Ring doorbell videos are much better.  One tip for setting it up:  Eero said to plug in the first unit and the modem simultaneously,  but the Comcast modem takes about a minute to connect so the Eero unit seemed to be struggling to connect.  I would suggest plugging in the modem first, let it show all the lights up and running, then plug in the Eero.  One other thought; some online reviews complain about the somewhat higher price of the Eero vs. Google wifi versus Orbi for example.  I think this is a mistake.  Having the best and fastest wifi in one's home is about as important as anything you have running in your house.  I am willing to pay extra for the best solution which this clearly is. ",
"David S.","August 19, 2016 ",5.0,"My house is 2400 sqft. rambler that is &#34;L&#34; shaped. The Internet connection enters the house all the way at one end.    I have tried powerline adapters, wifi extenders and high end wifi routers. Short of paying $750.00 - $1000.00 to wire the house with Cat6 this is the easiest solution.    I started with the 3pack. They were very easy to setup. The first week I had some connectivity issues so I purchased a 4th. I'm guessing the issues had to do more with the fact of where I wanted to place the units. I probably could have had put them in other less than desirable locations and I would have been fine.    I noticed that over time signal got more reliable perhaps the MIMO antenna learns where to concentrate its power in each unit.    The eero creates a &#34;mesh&#34; network so your devices will seemlessly switch between units.    Another excellent feature is that each eero has two radios inside one for sending and one for receiving data. This means unlike traditional extenders your data speed aren't cut in half with each additional unit.    I would recommend them for anyone who wants a reliable wifi network in their house. ",
Longliner,"February 19, 2017 ",5.0,"Have had these now for about 6 months, they work very well.  Have never had to reboot or fuss with them at all.  If there is an interruption from our ISP as soon as service comes back they are right on.  You have one password to access service anywhere in the house AND my wife did not complain about the boxes, very unobtrusive simple white.  I have 4 in my house and the speed does vary from room to room, the fastest being the box closest to the Comcast modem source, but every room has sufficient speeds to power anything you want to do.  Finally, I am not sure if I have EVER encountered any technology as easy to set up as eero, completely amazing, real idiots deluxe, it was up and running in minutes and has never stopped.  All in all a great system, highly recommended - wish they were cheaper :( ",

"Paul Herz","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"My family's home is an older home, with thick interior walls made of brick (not just brick façade). What's more, it's two stories and it's long. Ever since Wi-Fi came into popular use, we had a single router in a closet at one end of the house — an old Linksys. Of course, that meant that barely one half of the house had Wi-Fi, but this was still in the days of Wi-Fi extension cards. About five years ago, I scrapped that router and put an Apple Airport Extreme in its place, with an Airport Express in the opposite corner of the house. This worked a lot better, but there was a dreaded dead zone in the middle, which became apparent as we walked through it with our smartphones and our current task slowed to a halt. As soon as I found out about this system, which claims to handle good signal propagation for you (provided you place them at a certain interval with line-of-sight), I was very excited. I bought five for the house, and dotted them throughout, favoring the rooms of family members who had chronically complained about terrible signals and speeds for years. After giving the system a few days to &#34;self-configure,&#34; (eero's secret sauce), everyone had consistently good speeds and reliable signal in every corner of the house, on every device. What's more, we get the speed we're actually paying for with our ISP. Suffice to say I love this product. I don't think the price is that bad when I compare a single unit to an Airport Express, similar in price and size — the eero does more than the Express anyways. One caveat to anyone looking at these is the speed drop that you may experience when your device is connected to an eero node that is several hops away from a wired connection. eero has reduced this problem compared to standard repeaters, but the fact is that you lose speed with each hop — my solution was to hardwire a few eero nodes using Power over Ethernet devices to get ethernet in the middle of the house.

"Jose Porro","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Setting this up was really easy and is providing great coverage.  At first I was put back a bit because I was used to having a 2.4g and 5g network using my old system where zeros just creates one and doesn't really specify what its doing.  After using it for a couple of weeks, I couldn't care less as I have the bandwidth I need in the spot I needed it in.  I also set up the guest network which works perfectly.  This is not cheap, but so far, I feel like it was money well spent.  No more networking concerns.    Because I bought a 110 year old house, there is no cabling option so everything has to work on wifi.  But because of the walls being plaster and brick, my old system with extenders just wasn't working.  Now I have almost 20 devices connected (from the video doorbell, to all the computers, TV, sound system, lights, etc) without any issue.  I have an internet service that provides 50Mbps download speed.  Next to the connected router i am getting consistent speed of 57Mbps using netflix's speed test.  At the other end of the house where I have a TV connected with an Apple TV, the test is producing 27-29Mbps which is plenty for streaming.  There are areas that drop below that speed, but so far nothing that is terrible.  I may end up buying additional routers to help in some of the weaker areas, but for now, I cannot be happier with the system. ",
SuperJon,"September 30, 2016 ",5.0,"I installed this system in my small office approximately three weeks ago.  We have 15 devices connecting to them wirelessly.  So far, they have worked flawlessly.  They are incredibly easy to setup using the free mobile app.  They offer superb bandwidth via WiFi and seem to really do well at not dropping connections.  I have absolutely zero complaints so far.  As well, the range for each module is very impressive.  We can easily go 100 ft in any direction and have excellent signal.    My one favorite feature about the EERO system compared to several other similar systems I was looking at, is that each module has two ethernet ports on that back that allow two things to be available: 1) I can hardwire devices at my office(that do not have wifi option) to these via ethernet cable, and 2) I can hardwire the modules via ethernet back to the main unit serving as the router which provides a more robust setup with a much less chance of dropouts.    I will definitely recommend these to other for their small offices and homes. These are fantastic! ",
"G. C.","September 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Since I heard the news Apple's leaving the wireless router market, I've decided to give eero a try, as my airport extreme is aging (tech-wise), and I have always want to give the viritual MESH network a try.    Not disappointed at all. Have 3 eero place at different part of the home. In the past, I have had slow wireless coverage in the upstairs area, eero's able to extend the coverage in a noticeable manner.    Setup is still not as easy as the AirPort Extreme but still better than the Google Onehub.    The Eero iOS app is also nice -- I am able to monitor the home network while I am *not* at home and off of the wifi network. ",
RoadRage,"January 18, 2017 ",5.0,"I struggle w/ 4 or 5 stars. I am a engineer and my network maybe was a bit different then the intended audience and I want to be fair if this is at all the cause for my challenges. That being said, if you are looking for a simple to use wifi mesh that will cover a large square footage home, this is a great product and dead simple to install. My only complaint is after initial install the app stated that &#34;Everything Looks Good&#34; although I was unable to pass traffic from any wireless connected device. It was not until I went into &#34;Help--&#62;My Internet is slow--&#62;Run Health Check&#34; that there was a sign of an issue. I just found this very misleading and as a technical person I did know howto logically troubleshoot but would my friend or family member or would this be a call to the guy who recommends it, me ? The other issue was an undocumented feature that suddenly appeared after a software update that now my wireless devices can not converse with my wired devices, this presents an issue because my wired device is my desktop/media server and now none of my devices can do app hand off in spotify to my desktop.  Another EXCELLENT win for this solution is support, I spoke with a girl who was extremely knowledgeable and courteous and would say this is the best consumer network device support in the industry right now.  Please keep in mind, if you have a very simple cable modem and wireless setup, you may have no issues but I have a cable modem, router, switch, wired VoIP, wired desktops, and now Eero for wifi and there are some challenges.

"Peter Jensen","December 9, 2016 ",5.0,"I loved the small footprint of the devices, and the simplicity of the management. However I ended up returning them after a prolonged troubleshooting with the otherwise excellent customer service. I had multiple periodic but recurring issues with the eero. First and foremost my Sonos systems really did not like the eero system - my players would drop off the network randomly and there would be much skipping and stopping of music play. Occasionally my streaming devices would lose connectivity too, but the frequency was much less so than with Sonos. The eero troubleshooting seemed fixated on my netgear gigabit switch which they thought eero did work well with. Since I couldn't detach my wired network for extended periods the troubleshooting stalled and I decided to return the eero. As contrast - I replaced it with the Orbi mesh network router. All of my Sonos devices have worked perfectly since, I have had no issues with my streaming devices. Connectivity and speed seem really good and my wired switch is operating as expected so my recommendation would be to go with Orbi (which is also the mesh &#34;pick&#34; by the Wirecutter blog). ",
"J. L. Coddington","April 14, 2017 ",4.0,"Before eero, one of our computers would disconnect from WiFi frequently and we had occasional buffering issues with Netflix and Amazon Video on our smart televisions. I should also mention that In the last couple of years we've added two tablets, an Amazon Echo, an Echo Dot, a device that monitors our rooftop solar panels, a Joule sous vide, a Hue bridge and several WiFi-enabled LED light bulbs. Projecting that there will be more smart devices to come in the near future, we needed to act. After researching routers and router extenders, it was decided that the eero system would be our best option. A hefty price break sealed the deal and we purchased a three pack. Since the eero system was put into service to blanket the house, we've had no further connectivity issues. Installation was incredibly simple--all devices connected easily and they work as they are supposed to. As non-techies, automatic updates are a big plus; there is no wondering if our router is up-to-date (if it wasn't, we wouldn't have known how to update it anyway). Unlike our previous routers, eero's appearance is sleek and unobtrusive. We like our eero system so much that we will be ordering another one or two for our vacation home shortly. ",
"Irene Erlin","April 19, 2017 ",2.0,"I have tried many extender router, different brands from cheap to the most expensive ones, somehow all of them always gave problems such as disconnected many times, signal lost, super difficult to do the setting etc. Eero was my one last attempt, and it worked like magic. Very easy to install even for people who knows nothing about router setting, just install the app, tap tap tap. Signal strong, no disconnection, simply work. I had a problem before and tried to contact the customer support, their response was super, I got personal help one on one who patiently helped me find the problem. One downside though: it's expensive, but compare to what I have spent with many brands that now just stay in my drawer, I say Eero is definitely the best investment! ",
Michael,"December 26, 2016 ",5.0,"Fantastic.  I live in a 4 story house and was using a patchwork quilt of wireless routers, but still had dead zones everywhere, dropped signals and all sorts of problems.  I set up the eero system using 1 eero for each floor and it works perfectly.  The eeros are each plugged in to an ethernet jack.  However, I had to configure the system in a specific way that may be of interest to some of you.  The house is wired with ethernet jacks on each floor; they all emanate from the basement where the signal comes in from Time Warner Cable.  I had to get 4 eeros, and put one of them upstream of the switch that channels the signals to the different rooms.  Furthermore, I had to get a new switch since the very old linksys device I used to be using as a switch would not stop handing out its own IP addresses no matter how many times I changed its parameters telling it not to!  The eeros did not like that and got confused.  Once I bought a simple new 16-port switch, everything worked perfectly.    There's another product out there called Ubiquiti Unifi wireless access points, but apparently you have to be a tech genius to set it up and the tech support is non-existent.  Avoid at all costs. ",

I'll admit the price tag gave me pause initially, but I was desperate for a solution to inconsistent WiFi throughout my home and constantly buffering Netflix and Hulu. We don't have cable, so streaming quality is important to us. The system came highly recommended by a friend who had similar issues, so I gave it a try. I had tried various routers and range extenders (wired and wireless) in the past, none of which seemed to work as advertised.    First, and most importantly, the system works. It created a single, continuous network throughout my home. I don't have to switch networks when I'm on the patio or upstairs and my online and streaming experience is now what I expect it to be. We have phones, tablets, computers, printers, Sonos, Roku, etc. all connected to a single network and it works awesome.    The packaging was clean and elegant. The setup could not have been more simple. The iPhone app is incredible. It allows me to monitor the network, see which devices are connected, test download and upload speeds, turn on/off guest access, and more.    After several weeks, one of the units wasn't connecting to the network, so I called their support number. It was late on a Sunday evening and I was connected with a polite, English-speaking representative. He tried a few things and in a matter of minutes decided to express ship a new replacement unit instead of keeping me on the line. It was easily one of the best call center experiences I've had.

"Melissa B","November 29, 2016 ",5.0,"We got this a few months ago and have had no issues with it.  And now that they have added Family Profiles, it's even better.  After years of incomplete Wi-Fi coverage of our 2 story home (2600 sqft), we finally have coverage everywhere - including the back yard.  It was very easy to set up, and all our devices work with it (laptops, Apple TV, Roku, iTouch, iphone, Nintendo DS, Wii U, etc).  The new family profiles let me manage our kids' devices individually, automatically cutting them off an hour before bedtime and letting me pause their access at any time.  I can also see all devices on the network and manage them individually.  The app is easy to use and I can use it anywhere.  I use the guest network for babysitters and other guests and can turn if off and/or change the password easily thru the app.  Note - Only issue we did have was the Apple TV dropping access, but we used a network cable to connect it directly into one of the Eero units and have had no more dropping.

"david renton","January 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Having spent money over and over on various wifi extenders, it was a joy to be able to install this product quite easily and for it to work really well, just about instantaneously.  The concept is elegant, you add more if you need to, and I believe they all take care of the housekeeping between them, handing you from one to the other as you move around your house.  No more waiting while my device hunts for a different supplier of the same wifi signal while it switches from the main wifi to the range extender.  No more 'the server timed out because your device appears to be offline' messages. I would always think &#34;I didn't stop paying for that internet - it's still there, and I shouldn't have to coax a device into communicating with my router&#34;.  Also the design is pleasing, the squared-off white hockey puck doesn't look like much wherever it's placed, and the cord from the bit that plugs into the wall outlet is long enough that you have placement options.

"Gilbert L. Standen","June 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I was 100% totally satisfied with the 2-pack eero.  First of all I use a Blackberry OS 10 device (Blackberry Passport) and the first step is to download their eero app which as a Blackberry OS10 user you can download the android app from Google Play Store on Blackberry OS10 (see Cobalt guide at crackberry.com on how to install Google Play Store on Blackberry OS10 devices) or you can download it from 1MobileMarket but oddly even though I bought this product from Amazon, the eero app was not available in the Amazon App Store.  Anyway, the eero app RUNS PEFECTCLY on Blackberry OS10 so I'm sure it will run perfectly on true Android phones as well, and they also have eero for Apple iPhone.  As far as installation and setup it was the easiest sweetest wifi setup ever.  You first install the eero app and then the app takes you through the install and setup of the equipment.  My existing setup was a Cisco DPC3208 Cable Modem on the Charter Cable network and a Netgear WNDR3400v3 for providing wired connections plugged into the ethernet port of the Cisco Modem.  The eero devices have two ports.  You can use one port for the connection to the modem and the other port (they are equivalent ports btw) you can use to plug in a switch for wired connections.  I added the switch last after everything was completely setup by plugging it into the extra port on the gateway eero attached to the modem.  So the setup is done from the eero app. All the steps went totally smoothly with no problems - sweet.  There was one page though after the initial connection and plug-in of everything where it said something like &#34;network not detected plug in your router&#34; but I just pressed next to the next step and it detected the network immediately so not sure what was up with that page.  All the rest of the steps were totally smooth.  You take the next eero and position it somewhere in the house where you need wifi and then once all the eero have been added to the network (which is ALL done by the eero APP - it tells you what is happening and what if anything you need to do next).  Then the app prompts if you want to download updates to the eero software and I tapped yes and that took about 10 minutes or so and went through with no problems at all.  Now one cool thing is that this eero network was TOTALLY ADDITIVE.  The existing Cisco Modem has a wireless network built-in too, and that is still working and available, but now the eero network is added too so there are two networks to choose from, with the eero being the extendable network (I could buy another eero unit and add it to the network if necessary).  I give this product 5 stars and would give it 6 stars if I could!  It's a really easy to deploy great product that works and just adds on to your existing network at least for my network. ",

Over the years I've encountered nearly every problem known to man around residential internet and wireless networks. If you value having reliable connectivity and have at least six wireless devices then you should totally make the investment in the Eero device.    I also really like having admin control over my devices via the mobile app. The app allows you to boot any device and group them so you know exactly which device is connected and how they contribute to the bandwidth load on your network. Also some really clean features for managing temporary guest networks. I have a vertical layout townhouse, 2,000 sq ft with four floors between the basement and roof terrace. I installed my Eero 3 pack wired via ethernet but I found that even the two pack was very effective. I have 100mbps service with 14 connected devices (5 of which are wired using a gigabit switch). ",
"Paco M. Aubrejuan","April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"I've struggled with wifi coverage in my house for a long time.  My router is at one end of the house, and my television on the other end.  I purchased three different high end routers over the past couple of years, and each of them worked intermittently.  I would have to reboot my router every couple days as my bandwidth at the far end of my house lagged.    I read the review for Eero and saw that it received high scores in two key areas for me:  First, I wanted something that was super simple to install and maintain.  I only need one feature- for the router to work.  Second, I wanted it to be super stable and not cycle between working well and not working well.  I can say now that the Eero is a perfect 10/10 on both of these requirements.  I haven't had to reboot a single time in the last month, and my family has finally stopped complaining about the bad wifi signal.  It is well worth the extra money to finally have a router system that works and continues to work. ",
"Mary Ventura","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"5 years ago I moved from a 1300 sqft home to a 3300 sqft home. And for 5 years I have struggled to get consistent, high quality coverage throughout our space.  I have spent at least $300 in modems, wifi routers and extenders, not to mention hours...sometimes the better part of an entire day setting a network up, only to find equipment isn't compatible and I need to start over.    We had made due with one extender that needed to be reset about 3x week.    When I heard about Eero I was excited, maybe my evenings of crawling out of bed in the middle of a show to reset the signal were over.    They ARE!!! Eero is as amazing as I heard it was!!!  I set the whole system (I bought the 3 pack) up in about 30 minutes- that includes time spent reading the instructions.  We have a network, a personalized password that makes sense...not the weird random series of characters everyone hates but beginners don't know how to change...    (For reference, I don't consider myself a beginner in this work, I am tech savvy and able to work my way through networks and systems, however setting up multiple different extenders on one network proved difficult for me. We had personalized network password before eero).    I can control everything from my phone...not much to control but I can see how many devices are on the signal, turn the device lights off/on, and see the speeds I'm uploading/downloading at.    Also, the diagram says to centralize all the hubs, but due to the odd layout of our house it just wasn't possible. Even without the centralizing we have full signal in every room, including our garages and backyard. We basically cover 1/2 an acre!!! It's not full strength all over, but it's covers the space!    We have been up and running solidly for a month now...no issues!    The CONS-  *I know I should list $$$, however I think the quality of the devices compared to the cost I've spent trying to get what this delivers is fairly comparable...I'd much rather spend the money once on one functional product than little bits at a time trying to make something work that just doesn't ever get there.  *Ethernet outlets are limited. This isn't a huge deal, but our printer is outdated and we needed a way to connect it. Updating printer now. ",
Doug,"June 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I installed this eero (pack of 3 unit) combo mesh system as soon as I received them via Amazon Prime. Because I was also installing Comcast 150mbps Internet service the next day and until installed , I continued to use the slower att DSL solution that day with these new units with a WiFi ssid already configured to my own desired WiFi IDs/passwords. Then using these eero units, I just power cycled then reconnected to the nice/simple Netgear cable modem(CM600-100NAS) I ordered at the same time as I ordered these eero units, just changing a the 10BaseT cable from the att gateway to new Comcast modem when Comcast lit up the service the following day at my house.    With the Comcast service, I wanted better WiFi coverage than supplied by any Comcast gateway integrated router. Plus I did-not want to lease any cablemodem/routher wifi equipment from Comcast (ROI of providing myself less than a year).  It seemed like the eero was a possible clean solution, providing better wifi coverage than available using the gateways provided under lease from my ISP (Comcast).    The eero packaging was very clean and well marked for &#34;how to install&#34; and the iPhone application to do the actual set-up was surprisingly very simple to use. After installing the initial set of eero's with full success, I decided to get fancy as I wanted to get &#34;5 bars of coverage&#34; everywhere in a rather large home footprint along with a separate detached storage area/building, so I ordered a 2nd set of eeros to expand my newly installed wifi mesh network.    After expanding my eero mesh network, all went well again except some results with speedtest.net were more inconsistant than before my eero added expansion. To understand what was going on I rang a call into the eero support line (link to call right on the Iphone eero application(and iphone application easy to use, configure ssids/passwords, adding a guest network, etc). This support call I made is where eero really shined because:  A gentleman named Dave answered the phone at the eeros support number. Dave was not just a phone agent answering and reading from a script. Rather, he was obviously a well educated/experienced IT networking professional with good customer support skills. After reviewing my home network configuration and my concerns, Dave ran a performance test between my eeros and while doing so answered my many rather detailed questions (I'm &#34;retired from IT&#34;) with accuracy which I really appreciated. The quality of Dave's efforts working with me by phone was superb. It turns out I had two erros closer than need be, and in the end Dave's time with me over the phone assisted me in tuning this new eeros mesh network perfectly.  It's been flawless since.    In addition, as a side benefit of the eero design: each remote eero in the mesh network provides a spare 10BaseT port that can be used to connect a hardwired device (TV, PC, switch, etc) if desired, or be used, if a hardwired network is available, as a &#34;backhaul&#34; to the erro that is plugged into the cable modem.    So bottom line, eero provided me a perfect homerun solution.    Doug ",
Shopgirl17,"January 13, 2017 ",5.0,"It's truely worth the hype! I have had my eero for a few days now and I am super impressed. My home is over 2400 sq feet and I was constantly restarting my previous router. I always had dead spots and could never run more than 3 devices at once. Now with eero I have 9 devices on wifi with no lags, no buffering, and no slowness at all. I am truely amazed. I would curse my modem, router, and ISP everday because I was constantly power cycling my modem and router multiple times a day.  NOT ANY MORE since I have eero! It's worth $500 but I got it for $100 less on Prime Day. If you are experiencing the same issues then get past the $500 price tag. It is worth it. ",
"gustav zantanon","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I love old sturdy houses. They don't build 'em like they used to. Unfortunately, in 1873 WIFI was in it's infancy. Check that. It might have only been a glimmer in Jules Verne's or H.G.Wells' eyes. Anyway, these days thick plaster and lath walls soak up a WIFI signal like Bounty Towels on a TV ad. Plus the floor plan of my house puts the Entertainment room on the far end of the house. To explain my inability to connect or the eternal spinning vortex of the buffering icon I have always found lotsa blame with 1-My Internet Service Providers (even switching companies in my frustration) 2-The content providers server farms 3-Poltergeists (I am waiting for the day customer service for the above will invoke this as the best explanation). I tried two different WIFI extenders. There was only a teenie bit of improvement. The second extender claimed to be using both frequencies, but no improvements.    Then I saw a sidebar ad on Amazon (thank you for not using pop-ups) for a new concept in WIFI delivery for the home. Eero uses multiple devices strategically placed through the building to boost the signal. This time I read the directions before I started installing. But hey, I got excited, and soon realized I had plugged all three devices into power and totally out of order. While I was scolding my impetuosity, my Android (smartphone not the little electronic french maid* I also found on Amazon) told me that setup was complete and successful. My immediate skepticism is understandable (see above) so I do what I always do when my mother tells me juicy gossip from her neighborhood--trust but verify. I turned TV on, went to Internet content and clicked on Amazon Prime (seemed to be previously most finicky). To my delight, I watched an entire hour of the excellent series &#34;The Man in the High Castle&#34; without a single buffering pause. Yea. I am going to quit writing so I can get back to binge watching. Hope this helps    *Disclaimer: To the best of my knowledge, Amazon has no current or future plans to offer Android Maids to the general public. I believe you need to sign up for Amazon Prime** to make such a purchase.  **No, that's not true either. Good bye. ",
"Irene Erlin","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I have tried many extender router, different brands from cheap to the most expensive ones, somehow all of them always gave problems such as disconnected many times, signal lost, super difficult to do the setting etc. Eero was my one last attempt, and it worked like magic. Very easy to install even for people who knows nothing about router setting, just install the app, tap tap tap. Signal strong, no disconnection, simply work. I had a problem before and tried to contact the customer support, their response was super, I got personal help one on one who patiently helped me find the problem. One downside though: it's expensive, but compare to what I have spent with many brands that now just stay in my drawer, I say Eero is definitely the best investment! ",

The two airports would work well for a week and then it would get slower , slower and eventually need to be rebooted and then the saga continues for a week. Now I have a 3 eero setup and a minimum 30Mbps in space I used to get 5 , and most of the house 230Mbps , the network has been stable for a month with no crashes. Eero has updated the firmware at least 6 times silently and constantly improving in the background with no interruptions to the network. This is truly something which simplifies Wifi and just works. I'm excited to see some more features for QoS and other aspects like manual ability to restart the routers , mac addressing filtering or IP filtering . I gave it 4 stars because it holds onto my network which no other router has been able to , a missing star as it does not have all the features which compares itself to other routers in that category ",
Stark,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have never done an Amazon review before, but I wanted to share the fantastic experience I have had with eero—both the product and the company.    First, the product: Not much needs to be said except that I now have blazingly fast wifi throughout my house. It could not be easier to set up. The hardware is elegant and unobtrusive, unlike the alien spacecraft that other wifi companies seem to be producing these days. Also, the eero model of constant updates and improvements is far superior to what you will get from other companies. My eeros have already updated themselves several times, with improvements in performance and new features added.    As for the company, I cannot say enough about how great they are to work with. I did have some problems initially with streaming music services not working properly. I contacted eero, and they worked tirelessly to figure out what the problem was. The problem turned out to be related to another component in my network (not the eeros themselves) but they saw it through until the problem was solved. I now have no problems whatsoever with my network and in fact everything works much better than before. Also, unlike with other companies, I did not receive generic emails with general suggestions and links to online help documents. Instead, I exchanged emails with a single customer service representative who actually took the time to respond to my specific questions and worked with me until my problem was solved. For me, this kind of service and attention to detail makes the eero system worth every penny. This is a company that truly cares about its customers and about getting it right.    Conclusion: Buy it, you won’t be disappointed! ",

Not disappointed at all. Have 3 eero place at different part of the home. In the past, I have had slow wireless coverage in the upstairs area, eero's able to extend the coverage in a noticeable manner.

Matt,"July 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I live in a condo complex where my unit has 3 levels, lots of walls and stairs, and about 25 other wireless signals from neighbors. Traditional wifi setup (of a modem/router combo unit on the first floor and a range extender on the second level) just wasn't working. And believe me, I have tried and tried. After years of frustration and spotty signal strength from other products, I decided to go top of the line and order eero (3 pack). Finally, my problems are solved.  About 15 minutes after opening the box, eero was updated and broadcasting. I've never had a problem since. My ISP (Comcast unfortunately) provides 75Mbps; every speed test I've run with eero indicates 80+. The handoff of devices from one router to the next is equally impressive. The real kicker is the wall to wall coverage though; signal strength is routinely double that (160+), when before that I felt lucky to get 10.  I've used many devices at once; a wired computer, wired DVR, wireless DVR, wireless laptop, two iPads, three smart phones. None of them have ever lost a signal.  Expensive yes, but so worth it. ",
GreatWhiteShark,"December 9, 2016 ",5.0,"This is my second time giving eero a try.

Eero just did not work as advertised on AT&amp;T.    Fast forward to 6 months later after being frustrated with AT&amp;T speeds I switched over to Wave Broadband and got the 250 Mbps down and 10 Mbps package. Initially I took there generic cable modem/wifi router. What a disappointment, I had better speeds than with AT&amp;T however I was not getting what I paid for.

"A. Petranek","January 26, 2017 ",5.0,"I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled in this case. I had been struggling with our home wifi for years. We have a 2-story home and my wife has her office in our detached garage. Getting good wifi coverage has been impossible. To try to improve things, I originally purchased a typical range extender. That helped... but it was inconsistent - would sometimes provide a great signal on our second floor and in the garage, but often not - which might have been more frustrating than not having it at all. I was always rebooting it to try to get it to work.    I bought the Eero system out of desperation. Didn't want to have to go to a wired system, but didn't have much hope that it would actually do the job. I figured with my Prime membership and Amazon's return policy, I didn't have much to lose. I ordered 4 just to make sure I'd have adequate coverage in our home.    From the moment I plugged them in, things just worked. It was like magic. I didn't want to believe it at first - I kept our other router pumping out it's signal thinking that the Eero network would fail at any moment. It didn't. Ever.

For reasons I will not go into here, I quickly abandoned them because of the very security problem I was trying to get away from. With lots more investigation I looked for another solution. I came across eero, installed it and have not looked back since. I will simply say that if you are looking for an all around state of the art mesh network (wired) wireless routers that you can easily manage with their app and feel secure in this new internet of things world...eero is it! Don't worry about their cost... they are worth it... even at twice the price. They are &#34;monitored&#34; with upgrades as needed for the purchase price.

"Mal JD","February 18, 2017 ",5.0,"I live with my family of four in a two storey 1800 square foot house built in the 1920s. The house is not open plan and the walls are mostly lath and plaster. Typically we have a dozen or more devices competing for bandwidth. I had been “surviving” on the modem/router (gateway) supplied by Comcast, but the wi-fi signal to most parts of my house was weak at best. In the living room it was often less than one Mbps. In the upstairs bedrooms it was frequently less than five Mbps.    Before spending significant dollars on an Eero or Google wifi product, I purchased a new modem and new router, the latter a Linksys WRT1900ACS (I’ve since returned it). While it received good reviews for range, it made only marginal improvement in my home. In the living room where I plan to put a smart TV, it was still averaging under 10Mbps. So I decided to spring for one of the new mesh systems. I would have purchased Google wifi based upon the reviews, but they are out of stock everywhere.    So I decided to go with Eero. I purchased the three pack, even though that would seem overkill based upon what I read. I managed to get one Eero in one of the upstairs bedrooms, in line of sight (when doors aren’t closed) with the base Eero in the home office. Now the upstairs bedrooms get 100Mbps much of the time, but certainly above 75Mbps. Problem solved. The third Eero I put in the kitchen two rooms over from the living room. To my slight surprise, the Chromecast on my current TV connected to the Eero in the bedroom, directly above it. The living room now gets greater than 75 Mbps most of the time. Back in the kitchen and the adjoining dining room, I’m also getting in excess of 75Mbps. The back yard also benefits from the third Eero. Problem solved.    I may still try Google wifi, if I can get my hands on it before my return period ends with Amazon for the Eero, but if not, at least I can now enjoy awesome wi-fi coverage, even if it did cost me a few bucks more. As for the Eero - the set up was a breeze. My Sonos plugged in to the kitchen Eero worked first time, and the Eero app has worked flawlessly. The only slight disappointment, apart from the price, is not having the option to not broadcast the SSID. Perhaps that capability will come in one of their frequent updates. Also, I can’t see what devices are connected to a particular Eero, by selecting that Eero in the app. Instead I have to go to each device separately to see which Eero it is connected to. ",

"mike w","November 7, 2016 ",5.0,"We have an older, 3000 sq ft house and had dead zones and performance problems with my old Airport Extreme router.  Decided to take the plung to this one for better coverage (I also wanted to reach our outdoor kitchen area where we sometimes set up a Fire TV stick and projector to watch a movie).  I'm not sure if it is the bump to AC or the mesh network, but the 3 eero devices have been amazing. Looking forward to being able to turn off my kid's wifi via Echo as well.    I would give it 5 stars, except for 2 minor things:    1. Manual parental controls are great (scheduling no internet times, turning off internet on demand), but I'd love for more granular control in the form of a couple of new features. First, some basic content filtering.  My kids are getting older, and I'd love some simple filtering to prevent them from getting to known bad sites. Second, maybe allow time limits (not time of day, but limiting active internet use to 2 hours, for example). This would be harder, because iPads / iPhones are always in the background doing something on the network, so determining &#34;active&#34; usage could be challenging.    2. I cannot seem to get the port forwarding working. I have a Synology NAS running a web server with a wordpress blog, and I cannot seem to get it to allow the connection through.  Need to follow up with support, but the WiFi has been so great, I actually am OK with my web server being inaccessible in the meantime!    Edit: I just got a response from eero support about the port forwarding.  So it seems that the port forwarding is working fine, but the eero does not support hairpin NAT / NAT loopback, which means I can't access my internal servers through the external domain / IP.  Not a huge issue, since internally I can simply access the server via my internal IP.  When I access my domain on any other network, it works fine. So, while it's still not fully resolved, they did get back to me in 2 days and provided an answer to why I though it wasn't working. ",
"Steven D. Arnold","August 19, 2016 ",5.0,"I've tried many different wifi base stations over time. Most of them were somewhere between decent and unusable. Even high-quality vendors, like Apple's Airport, still kicked my devices and my family's off the network or didn't give good coverage throughout the house (which has four floors), thus resulting in poor or no performance in many cases. I have young children who sometimes watch movies on an iPad, so bad connectivity translates directly to an unpleasant day for me. I have to have a solution that works.    One idea I had was to put a different wifi router in each part of the house, hardwired via ethernet. The downside with this is if you connect to the one on the top floor with your phone, and then you walk downstairs, your connectivity is bad. So an interesting idea, but not really practical. And don't even start me on extenders. In my experience, they're all terrible, assuming they work at all, which is often not the case.    eevo really solves this problem and does a great job. I got the package of three base stations. I have my own internal network and don't want to connect the eevo directly to the Internet, so I set it up in bridged mode and made it serve a range of DHCP IP addresses. (Note: these are advanced settings, but it's nice to know it's possible to do this.) In my case, all three base stations were connected to house ethernet, which probably helps, but this is not technically necessary, according to eevo. (I did not test this, because I'm happy with my current configuration, and I'm sure at any rate that ethernet will be faster..)    The three base stations merged seamlessly into a single wifi network, available throughout the house. The network offers very strong signal (all bars) everywhere. It's the same network, so there's no need to connect to a different network in a different part of the house. The speed is excellent, very comparable to the best wifi routers I've used in the past. And neither I, nor my wife and kids, ever get kicked off the network. It's extremely stable.    It did take me a while to figure out I really wanted bridged networking. I just needed eevo to give me wifi DHCP access to my own network, nothing fancy beyond that. Also, the eevo documentation insists that you must plug your primary eevo directly into the service provider's modem, bypassing any firewalls etc, but this is not in fact necessary -- or I should say it might be necessary if your firewall is set up in an overly restrictive manner, but it was not a problem for me. (It might well also have been a problem if bridged networking had not been a sufficient solution for me.) I guess the point here is the docs are less than clear about this.    Overall, eevo provides exceptional service in signal, in speed, and in stability, far better for a whole-house solution than anything else I've ever tried -- and I've tried many, many different things over the years. It's a clear winner and if your needs and problems match those I described, I strongly recommend that you give eevo a try. ",
"D. Gerrity","January 8, 2017 ",4.0,"Im an electrical engineer and computer enthusiast.  I don't generally write a lot of reviews, however in this case the product is so outstanding I thought I would add my voice to the thousand others.    I have a 1300 square foot single floor condominium with high speed internet.  It would seem Eero would not be targeting me; with only drywall, a single wifi router should work.    After trying multiple types of wifi routers, including twice getting the latest generation AirPort Extreme router, I was frustrated with dropouts, start stops, timeouts, and interrupted streaming.    I'm not entirely sure, but I do think there were issues with the AirPort and my ISP around DNS, where some of the stuttering was due to IP address resolution potentially due to the IPv6 neighbor discovery protocol.  Or, perhaps it was crowding on the frequency due to 15 in range networks.    Regardless, by plugging in two Eeros (in 5 minutes), all those problems VANISHED and my internet speeds from my wifi devices increased by an order of magnitude.  I now have a third Eero for redundancy. They work like a charm.    Simple, fast, perhaps not inexpensive - nonetheless I recommend without reservation. ",
SuperJon,"March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"I have had these installed in our office for a month now and am 100% satisfied and very impressed with them.    I am a partner of a financial advising firm. We recently purchased and renovated a two story 3,500 sqft house for our new office. The house was built in the early part of the 1800's. the walls on this house are 12&#34; thick and solid concrete and brick. I was very concerned that I was going to struggle to get wifi signal properly dispersed into all the rooms of the building.    I put the first AP on the main floor. The other two are upstairs in different offices. I did a thorough site survey and am getting very strong signal in every room and around the outside perimeter of the building. This was true even with our mobile devices.    The initial installation was remarkably simple to on my iPhone 7 using the EERO app. One of the valuable &#34;extra&#34; features of this system are the duavailable Ethernet ports on the back of each device. My office manager uses a tower-style PC. It has no wireless capability. His office has no hardwired Ethernet ports in it. We were able to put one of the EERO devices in his office and run an Ethernet cable from the device over to his PC. He gets excellent connectivity and function.    I am very particular about my tech and expect it to perform as best as is possible. I could not be more pleased with the wifi speeds I am getting from this system. As well, none of my people have had any trouble whatsoever connecting to the wifi signal and getting good reliable service.    I will surely use these again when I need a wifi solution! ",
"Andrew Stuckey","July 31, 2016 ",5.0,"I gotta say I am impressed with this system.  Crazy easy to set up and no more large router with antenna sticking out everywhere in my living room.  Like most, I was concerned about the cost of the product for a company/brand that I have never heard of.  But I've been tired of my existing Wifi network so I knew I was going to go with a full system rather than a standalone router.    My setup: 17 wireless devices and 5 wired over a house that is 2-story/3200 sq ft with 200 mbps service.  Modem and router is in the back of the house on the main floor.  So upstairs toward the front of the house really struggled with speeds.  Range was fine but speeds weren't good enough because those are the bedrooms.  My house is newly built in 2015 so the materials in the wall aren't an issue.  Just the distance and plus its much better to have a router upstairs so the signal can filter down rather than downstairs trying to send the signal up.  However, I don't have a choice because of where my only cable line comes in the house (satellite everywhere else).  Over the last year, I've used Airport Extreme, Netgear Nighthawk (all of them) and Onhub.  I've been using the Nighthawk X6 the past few months.  Powerful, but overkill especially when you still have weak spots in the house.  So over the past couple weeks started looking again when I had to start rebooting the router a couple times a week for it to give me my proper speeds.  I had 3 choices: Amplifi, Eero and Google Wifi (when it comes out).  I didn't consider Orbi or Luma.  So I went with Eero.  I was up and running in 10 mins.  Unplug modem, hook up eero.  Power up everything and setup on app.  Done.  I made my SSID and password the same as my other router and all of the other devices immediately connected without issue.    So far my speeds have been great all over the house.  Everything loads fast.  As I get further away from the router connected to the modem the speeds drop a little but not by much.  And that is what makes it better than a regular range extender.  You get range AND speed.  They're not hardwired to each other so the speeds I get are excellent considered.  App is great and simple.  Light years ahead of Netgear's Genie app in terms of UI.  Almost everything that's out is ahead of that ;)    Couple things I wish it had:    1. Additional Ethernet port  2. Ability to create different SSIDs for 5GHZ and 2.4GHZ bands    For someone who wants a lot of advanced options that you would find in a Nighthawk router then you probably won't be pleased with this.  But I really just wanted something I set up, add a guest network and be done.  I don't care about QoS functionality and stuff like that.  So I'll see how this continues to work over the next few weeks and update my review accordingly.  Really with this, price is the major deal breaker for most.  If you can get by that, you should be fine with your purchase.  My review is more like 4.5/5. ",
BDW,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I have an old three level house.  I'm very tech savvy and wifi has been a total hassle in this house. I've bought top of the line routers, range extenders, and its all just been a total pain in the rear for one reason or another.    I read about eero in a science magazine, and it sounded too good to be true.  So I bought the 3pack.    WOW!  Works exactly as advertised.  Setup was so easy with the app.  ZERO HASSLE.  no complicated advanced settings to hassle with. No more dead spots. Excellent speed throughout my entire house - and outside too!    The ethernet ports on the back are great for the smart TV.  Did I mention NO HASSLE.  everyone in the family isvhappy. Visitors are happy.  I'm happy.  No more wasting hours of my life on ugly overpriced wifi routers!    Eero rules!!!  I'm so stoked.  Their marketing materials are spot on!  Home Wi-Fi is a huge part of enjoying the modern home.  Eero nailed it.  Literally changed my life!    Buy it!!!!  Ignore the negative reviews.  This is a 5-star product, I promise you!! ",
"Amazon Customer","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I picked eero to upgrade my wifi. I had an older Apple airport and was waiting for the next generation of Airports. Apple instead discontinued their Airports. I was a little hesitant at the switch to eero. I've used non Apple routers before, and was somewhat dreading the set up. I opened the box and then down loaded the app to my iPhone. It walked me through the set up like a stroll in the park. Set up number one, then it asked if I wanted to do another and then again for the third. I options for network control were easy to see and work. Family member restrictions for the children were easier than on the airport. The look and feel was more Apple like than Apples own products. I wish I'd switched earlier. Streaming to my AppleTVs has improved with less buffering. Streaming live TV through my HDHomerun extend has improved markedly. For people considering chord cutting that have multiple TVs, eero is a must have upgrade for your wifi. ",
buzzaxe,"July 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I Comcast as internet provider. I have a 3-level house and modem is in basement.The struggle has been to get WiFi to the rest of the house. The modem by itself was not effective at all. Like many, I tried to extend to the rest of the house using WiFi extenders (plug in to wall type). These worked ok but I still could only get between 18 and 46 Mbps. I was thinking this was as good as it was going to get until I saw the eero product.  I purchased the 3-pack and was impressed with how easy it was to setup (via iPhone app). Connected the first to the basement modem which created a new WiFi network and then connected the others throughout the house. I placed one on the first floor and one on the second floor. The eero app you download helps to get everything setup and could not believe how easy it was. I am now consistently running between 112-125 Mbps regardless of where I am at in the house. I also run multiple Xbox one consoles and Netflix, YouTube, etc. are no longer dropping connections.  I was able to get the $100 discount so my price for the 3 pack was $399. For me it was well worth because frustration with dropped or slow connections has stopped.    One quirk is that after setting up one of the eero, I had to move it but could not get it to reconnect. My solution was to remove it from the network with the iPhone app, reset the device (on the back of the eero using a needle/safety pin), and then adding back to the network using the app. Worked great after that.    Would definitely recommend this although the price is a little steep. ",
"Scott E Larson","February 19, 2017 ",5.0,"THANKS EERO!  GREAT PRODUCT!    My eero system was easy to set up and get working, but took some tweaking (with the placement of the devices - working with eero tech support) to REALLY dial up the performance.    Initial setup was simple once I turned my phone's bluetooth on...the first time I tried (with bluetooth off) it failed (obvious, in hindsight).  After my setup was complete, my wifi performance was as-good (and sometimes better) than my existing wifi network, which consisted of three (3) Apple Airport Extreme base stations, which mostly adequately covered most/all of my house but which did experience the occasional (always frustrating) dropouts.  I found my initial performance was mostly better than my 3-Apple-Airport-Extreme solution, and at slightly lower cost (3 eeros are ~$500, 3 Apple Airport Extremes are (179 *3) ~$580).    Once I moved the &#34;eero base station&#34; across the room (so that it was now adjacent to an &#34;internal wall&#34; instead of being next to an &#34;external wall&#34; as it had been initially), performance of the eero's became markedly better than the Apple Airport Extremes.    I'll be getting rid of my Apple Airport Extremes now! ",
"Amazon Customer","November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"This is the wifi I have been waiting for! I am absolutely amazed at how well this works. I will admit, I was skeptical especially after trying everything else. I have tried moving my wireless router out in the open, trying multiple extenders in multiple locations, changing ISP companies, and nothing has helped. The eero system simply works and works very well. I never write reviews, but I feel like this product warranted one. The price is right at the amount where you can't just impulse buy something like this. It took me several weeks to pull the trigger, but knowing what I know now, I would have bought eero a long time ago. My internet speeds in areas that were previous dead zones are faster now than what I was getting standing right next to my previous router. If it keeps working this well, I will be a customer for life. ",
K.F.,"July 6, 2016 ",5.0,"Despite a few hiccups, the system has been great.    My setup: I have a ~1400 sq ft, 2 story home. I bought 2 eeros so that I could place one downstairs (with my modem) and one upstairs where I used to have issues with connectivity. Prior to purchasing the eero system I had a tplink router and a tplink wifi extender plugged in upstairs. This worked in some cases but I had issues with devices dropping the network and even one device that would/could not connect to the wifi at all. My home has a second floor hallway which is open to the first floor.    Pros: I am getting faster internet. Devices are no longer dropping off the network. All my devices can now connect. The eero looks sleek and the app is pretty easy to use.    Cons: The system seems to be a bit finicky when it comes to placement of the eeros. It said to have the eero at person level but the only way I could get the upstairs eero to connect was to move the downstairs eero up onto a ~8 ft high shelf. Now, the two eeros have line of sight without any walls but it was still a little bit of a dance to get them to &#34;see&#34; each other. Maybe once you have them connected you can move them more easily. I don't have a need to since it works as is, but it wasn't as straight forward a process as I had hoped. Enough to make it not worth it? No. Enough to mention? I think so. Also I messed up connecting an ethernet switch, but once I explained my problem, it was updated on the help site. All in all, I think highly of the company and the product. ",
CSherr,"July 17, 2016 ",5.0,"Man, I really, really wanted these to work. The setup on them was *way* faster than the Linksys Velops. Their range is lower than the Velops, but I was okay with that because all I wanted was consistent, reliable wifi. While they started out slower than the linksys, they were still fast enough for everything we needed. The problem comes that within a week or two the speed drops off to almost nothing. I had my macbook pro literally 2 feet from one of the hardwired base stations. I was getting 2mbps. I restarted the base station (which requires you to unplug/plug it back in). After it came back up, I was getting 180mbps again. Not having to restart the eeros was the only reason I bought them (i.e. rock solid wifi). Their support was fairly good, but we never could get them to work 100%. So, I returned them. At this point, I'm back to using 4 airport extremes (all hardwired) around my house. I haven't had any issues since. ",
"eero support","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"We had an older WiFi with an extender that gave us constant headaches -- we often had to unplug the units several times a day and signal strength was uneven throughout our large house. After doing research on the eero vs. Google's unit, we decided on the eero not only because of the good reviews (in Amazon and in the technical press) but also because Google requires you to make the unit part of the ever-creeping Google ecosystem that watches everything you do in searches, emails, and the like, and adds it to the profile it keeps for you in order to sell ads more targeted to how they have you categorized. I would rather have my WiFi system just do its work without whispering about me to Google in the background!    The system is dead easy to set up -- literally, we just plugged and played, following the directions in the app. It worked right out of the box. Since installing eero, we have had flawless service - no interruptions and signal strength throughout the house is high.    The design of the units is sleek and unobtrusive. Although we didn't need to ask for help, apparently the support offered is excellent.    This works as well as any modern internet product we have put into service in recent years. Completely satisfied; would recommend and buy again if need arose. ",
"G. Thompson","March 29, 2017 ",2.0,"It's truely worth the hype! I have had my eero for a few days now and I am super impressed. My home is over 2400 sq feet and I was constantly restarting my previous router. I always had dead spots and could never run more than 3 devices at once. Now with eero I have 9 devices on wifi with no lags, no buffering, and no slowness at all. I am truely amazed. I would curse my modem, router, and ISP everday because I was constantly power cycling my modem and router multiple times a day.  NOT ANY MORE since I have eero! It's worth $500 but I got it for $100 less on Prime Day. If you are experiencing the same issues then get past the $500 price tag. It is worth it. ",
Shopgirl17,"March 12, 2017 ",5.0,"Just go buy this thing if you want flawless wifi all over your house and yard.  I bought this product with the hopes of having good wifi around my pool and that I could put Sonos speakers (that run on wifi) in my gazebo by my pool.  It works better than I could've ever imagined.  My previous setup had spotty reception at the back door.  Now I have full bars consistently on the other side of my pool (probably 50 ft from the back door). I was able to setup Sonos speakers out there and it works like a charm.    The setup for this is about as easy as it gets. You might have to play with it a little bit once you get it setup with the placement of each Eero for maximum performance, but you could probably put them anywhere and it would work great. I tried them in a couple of different rooms, they worked great everywhere, but some configuration seemed to work a little better than others.    Yes, it's expensive.  Like some reviews will tell you, if your a smart guy, you could probably rig up your own custom open mesh network that would the same for a fraction of the cost.  But I don't know how to do that, nor do I want to learn...I just want my wifi to work.  I recently cut the cable cord and we watch everything over streaming internet now, so I was able to justify this to my self.  This cost is just a few months of savings from not having a cable bill.    There's a lot of cool little features the app has too.  I probably don't know them all, but it has a built in way to run a speed test.  It somehow makes my wifi faster.  My plan is &#34;up to 25mbps&#34; and before, I would get a wide range of results from 2-18mbps.  Rarely ever 20+.  Now with Eero, 28mbps is the norm.  It has an option where you can just text your network name and password to others you want to allow on your network.  There's also a way to create a guest network, which i haven't done yet, but seems like it would be ideal for maybe a Fantasy Football draft where you could grant a bunch of people temporary access to your network and then remove it afterwards.    I've had trouble with wifi for years and this was my solution...man I wish I had this 5 years ago! ",

Sean,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Setting up eero was for me a revelation on par with using TiVo for the first time. I set up 3 units on 3 floors of a brick townhouse in about 10 minutes. The best part for me has been &#34;administering&#34; the network remotely through the iOS app. I have some guests staying at my place, and I didn't have to run over there to set up a guest network for them and change the password. You can also keep tabs on how many devices are on the network at any time.    In my case, the wireless router (TP-Link) that I replaced was acceptable. The eeros just penetrate more of the house. I plan to experiment more with placement, as I plan to add at least one wifi security camera to the network. It would be a good feature if the eero smartphone app guided you on placement or told you if, for example, moving one of the devices to a new location helped or hurt.    Overall a fantastic experience in my first few days. ",
ddlj81,"July 30, 2016 ",5.0,"Extremely easy to setup via the app. Ensures the same wi-fi name can be extended through out the home (unlike some other products).  The app can test download speeds and upload speeds at various points in home. My download speed of iPhone increased 4 times from 24 bps to close to 100 bps consistently (after 24 hrs, the effect is even more prominent). My corner bedroom which used a slow PC got a 3 times boost in download speed. I have tried two other systems before (Azeus and extenders), but this system is the only one you will ever need. My house about 4000 sq feet and since I installed this, there is a huge difference.

KH,"October 2, 2016 ",5.0,"works great. ended up buying a 3rd (should have bought the 3 pack). I have 3 floors in my house. The eero in the upper and lower floor are direct wired to my switch. The one in the middle floor is wireless only. Did a speed test with a Ethernet connection from the middle floor eero to my laptop, get to 250mbps pretty constantly which is great. Bought these to be able to have a continuous wifi signal on the same network ID. It takes a little time for devices to switch over, so I sometimes have to turn airplane mode off/on quickly to get the strongest signal. If you wait a few minutes, it does it usually automatically.  Important &#62; if you want to direct wire them, then you CANNOT just connect them all to a switch (unless I got that info wrong). After some research, I found that you have to connect the primary directly to your router with the one Ethernet port and then connect the 2nd Ethernet port to your switch. There should be a bit more documentation on that. ",

"Michael Green","September 17, 2016 ",5.0,"I installed two of these in a small house and the coverage is outstanding. That's not surprising given the size of the house, but the more interesting thing is how well the devices work. With multiple access points, I used to have to occasionally mess with WiFi on my phone to get it to associate with  the device with the strongest signal. At other times, I would have to take extra steps to get things to connect with WiFi at all. After installing the eero access points, I don't even have to think about WiFi. Another feature that is a positive is how the system updates. It just happens and you get notified. No downloading firmware and rebooting. It's not that hard to update firmware on an access point, but it's much nicer to know that the system is just taking care of that and then letting you know. It really is the case that these are very easily installed and then just work. That says lots about the care and thought that went into the engineering and user experience design. ",

"Michael Brown","September 7, 2016 ",5.0,"Very happy customer here!  I first heard of the eero system from the Cult of Mac podcast (if you're an Apple fan and haven't heard it yet, I highly suggest you give it a go).  One of the podcasters was raving about how the eero had massively improved the wifi coverage in his home, and I was instantly intrigued.  My house is about 1,300 square feet and the modem sits in one corner while the Apple TV sits in the diagonally opposite corner.  Before eero, shows on Netflix, Amazon, etc. would constantly pause to buffer, which of course can be quite frustrating.  The price tag for the three-pack eero system is a hefty one, no denying that, but I justified the purchase because I had some Amazon gift cards that covered half of the cost...and I'm very glad I made that purchase!  Setup was so easy: download the app to your phone and it walks you through in a matter of minutes.  It's suggested that you place your eero devices within sight of each other, but the physical structure of my house makes that impossible.  I have one in each opposite corner, plus one in the hallway in the middle of the house.  It works perfectly!  I will note that the first day I used the system, I noticed a couple of times the blinking light on the devices that indicated loss of connectivity.  However, during that first night the system did its initial software update (so cool that it does it on its own!), and ever since then it's been running flawlessly.  Strong wifi signal throughout the house, zero loss of connectivity, zero spontaneous Netflix bufferings.  If you can swallow the cost of the device, stop thinking about it and just buy it! ",
"Daniel Hosler","February 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Having installed two of these systems, I can tell you they are extraordinarily easy to setup, and monitor through the iphone app. The setup is easy, intuitive, and the troubleshooting if the device is not in a good location was very helpful.    My only suggestion (and it may already be corrected) is as follows. My network sits behind a firewall that is doing the DHCP. In order to get the device setup, and routing correctly for all the fun devices on my network (4 Sonos boxes, Ring doorbell, couple others), you must first setup EERO in front of the firewall. Next step was to then change the IP address to a range within the private network. And lastly, switch into bridge mode. It then takes 15-30 minutes as each EERO needs to restart, and pass along the info.    This was critical in order for all the wireless devices to be able to talk to one another. I think a youtube video showing exactly how this works would be helpful. Again, it may be up there by the time someone reads this. ",
"Retired Engr","August 9, 2016 ",5.0,"I have a 3 story condo and my wi fi wasn't reaching from the bottom to top floor.  I had tried a range extender and, while it allowed me to get an adequate signal where I added the extender, there were still a number of weak spots plus my devices wouldn't always change networks properly.  I read all the reviews on the eero system and finally decided to give it a try.  Most of the reviews I read have already hit the high points.  The 3 devices come well packaged and appear to be robustly built with a good quality finish.  I didn't have any issues setting up the devices using my iPhone; I was up and running in less than 30 minutes.  My signal strength/download rates were improved significantly throughout the house and now there is no need to switch networks since the mesh approach makes the devices look like one network.  After installation, I wanted to move one of the devices for improved coverage; so sent a test to eeros to make sure I knew how.  The response came shortly and it turned out you just unplug the device from its current location and plug it in in the new location; everything synchs up automatically.  I've been running for a couple of months now and everything is still working great.  I definitely would recommend this product. ",

"Mal JD","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I live with my family of four in a two storey 1800 square foot house built in the 1920s. The house is not open plan and the walls are mostly lath and plaster. Typically we have a dozen or more devices competing for bandwidth. I had been “surviving” on the modem/router (gateway) supplied by Comcast, but the wi-fi signal to most parts of my house was weak at best. In the living room it was often less than one Mbps. In the upstairs bedrooms it was frequently less than five Mbps.    Before spending significant dollars on an Eero or Google wifi product, I purchased a new modem and new router, the latter a Linksys WRT1900ACS (I’ve since returned it). While it received good reviews for range, it made only marginal improvement in my home. In the living room where I plan to put a smart TV, it was still averaging under 10Mbps. So I decided to spring for one of the new mesh systems. I would have purchased Google wifi based upon the reviews, but they are out of stock everywhere.    So I decided to go with Eero. I purchased the three pack, even though that would seem overkill based upon what I read. I managed to get one Eero in one of the upstairs bedrooms, in line of sight (when doors aren’t closed) with the base Eero in the home office. Now the upstairs bedrooms get 100Mbps much of the time, but certainly above 75Mbps. Problem solved. The third Eero I put in the kitchen two rooms over from the living room. To my slight surprise, the Chromecast on my current TV connected to the Eero in the bedroom, directly above it. The living room now gets greater than 75 Mbps most of the time. Back in the kitchen and the adjoining dining room, I’m also getting in excess of 75Mbps. The back yard also benefits from the third Eero. Problem solved.    I may still try Google wifi, if I can get my hands on it before my return period ends with Amazon for the Eero, but if not, at least I can now enjoy awesome wi-fi coverage, even if it did cost me a few bucks more. As for the Eero - the set up was a breeze. My Sonos plugged in to the kitchen Eero worked first time, and the Eero app has worked flawlessly. The only slight disappointment, apart from the price, is not having the option to not broadcast the SSID. Perhaps that capability will come in one of their frequent updates. Also, I can’t see what devices are connected to a particular Eero, by selecting that Eero in the app. Instead I have to go to each device separately to see which Eero it is connected to. ",

I was skeptical Eero would be the solution and had a hard time stomaching the high price tag.  Within 15 min of it's arrival, I had all 3 stations set up via the simple user friendly app. We have been using Eero for 2 weeks now and life has drastically improved!  I cannot praise this system enough. The wireless is perfect and extremely fast everywhere in our house, even with the 10-20 devices we have running. It's even been flawless on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings which were previously the worst. I can get a crystal clear fast connection by my pool and in the basement. No more buffering and no more bouncing b/w the extender and regular network. Eero is a dream come true! ",
"Daniel Hosler","July 30, 2016 ",5.0,"Having installed two of these systems, I can tell you they are extraordinarily easy to setup, and monitor through the iphone app. The setup is easy, intuitive, and the troubleshooting if the device is not in a good location was very helpful.    My only suggestion (and it may already be corrected) is as follows. My network sits behind a firewall that is doing the DHCP. In order to get the device setup, and routing correctly for all the fun devices on my network (4 Sonos boxes, Ring doorbell, couple others), you must first setup EERO in front of the firewall. Next step was to then change the IP address to a range within the private network. And lastly, switch into bridge mode. It then takes 15-30 minutes as each EERO needs to restart, and pass along the info.    This was critical in order for all the wireless devices to be able to talk to one another. I think a youtube video showing exactly how this works would be helpful. Again, it may be up there by the time someone reads this. ",

Prior to Eero my Verizon Fios router could not reach the top floor or basement effectively. Even when it did the bandwidth was poor. Even my Nighthawk router could not provide decent download speeds for my PS4.    I purchased a set of 3 devices and in minutes I was up and running. I can now easily hit base max speed on my fios connection and have tripled my downloading of games.    I will note that one device offered the most impressive speed increase but was not enough to cover the entire house. With all 3 the speed drops slightly but the range is fantastic.

SuperJon,"August 3, 2016 ",5.0,"I have had these installed in our office for a month now and am 100% satisfied and very impressed with them.    I am a partner of a financial advising firm. We recently purchased and renovated a two story 3,500 sqft house for our new office. The house was built in the early part of the 1800's. the walls on this house are 12&#34; thick and solid concrete and brick. I was very concerned that I was going to struggle to get wifi signal properly dispersed into all the rooms of the building.    I put the first AP on the main floor. The other two are upstairs in different offices. I did a thorough site survey and am getting very strong signal in every room and around the outside perimeter of the building. This was true even with our mobile devices.    The initial installation was remarkably simple to on my iPhone 7 using the EERO app. One of the valuable &#34;extra&#34; features of this system are the duavailable Ethernet ports on the back of each device. My office manager uses a tower-style PC. It has no wireless capability. His office has no hardwired Ethernet ports in it. We were able to put one of the EERO devices in his office and run an Ethernet cable from the device over to his PC. He gets excellent connectivity and function.    I am very particular about my tech and expect it to perform as best as is possible. I could not be more pleased with the wifi speeds I am getting from this system. As well, none of my people have had any trouble whatsoever connecting to the wifi signal and getting good reliable service.    I will surely use these again when I need a wifi solution! ",
"Geoffrey D. Hoffman","November 3, 2016 ",5.0,"If I would've written a review within the first month or two it would've been five stars, hands down. Unboxing and setup are a breeze and the iPhone app is a nice touch. I'm glad I waited because after 3 or 4 months, something has happened and I'm worse off than I was before with a single point wifi router. I don't think the product deserves 5 stars. I agree with all the 5 star reviews for the first 3 months of owning the product.    Out of the blue, for no apparent reason, with no changes to my home, the Eero node placement, or number of devices connecting, I am suddenly getting random network outages, dropped wifi and reconnecting, I have to forget the network and re-join it, my printer 100% refuses to connect, I had to forcibly put in the MAC address with a DHCP reservation to get my Macbook Pro to connect. It is really disappointing. When it works, it's great, but it's becoming very inconsistent and I am having a 3 week long conversation with support to try to remedy the situation. They told me to try swapping one of the nodes with the one attached to the physical router. I tried that and it had no effect.    This product is definitely not worth $500 and tech support has been slow to respond. ",
"eero support","February 10, 2017 ",5.0,"We have an older, 3000 sq ft house and had dead zones and performance problems with my old Airport Extreme router.  Decided to take the plung to this one for better coverage (I also wanted to reach our outdoor kitchen area where we sometimes set up a Fire TV stick and projector to watch a movie).  I'm not sure if it is the bump to AC or the mesh network, but the 3 eero devices have been amazing. Looking forward to being able to turn off my kid's wifi via Echo as well.    I would give it 5 stars, except for 2 minor things:    1. Manual parental controls are great (scheduling no internet times, turning off internet on demand), but I'd love for more granular control in the form of a couple of new features. First, some basic content filtering.  My kids are getting older, and I'd love some simple filtering to prevent them from getting to known bad sites. Second, maybe allow time limits (not time of day, but limiting active internet use to 2 hours, for example). This would be harder, because iPads / iPhones are always in the background doing something on the network, so determining &#34;active&#34; usage could be challenging.    2. I cannot seem to get the port forwarding working. I have a Synology NAS running a web server with a wordpress blog, and I cannot seem to get it to allow the connection through.  Need to follow up with support, but the WiFi has been so great, I actually am OK with my web server being inaccessible in the meantime!    Edit: I just got a response from eero support about the port forwarding.  So it seems that the port forwarding is working fine, but the eero does not support hairpin NAT / NAT loopback, which means I can't access my internal servers through the external domain / IP.  Not a huge issue, since internally I can simply access the server via my internal IP.  When I access my domain on any other network, it works fine. So, while it's still not fully resolved, they did get back to me in 2 days and provided an answer to why I though it wasn't working. ",

I used to fight having multiple wi-fi endpoints, and the best speed I could hope for was usually about 10 Mbps.  Coverage was non-existent in the farthest bedrooms, now a speedtest from my phone, from the furthest wifi, shows 108Mbps download, which is my full Internet throughput, at the far corner of the house where it would never connect before.  Handoff between devices as you move through the house is seamless, before, even with the same SSIDs, I'd have to disable and reenable wifi before it would grab the closer device.  All configured very easily through the phone app.  We switched Internet providers while I was out of town, and had to redo the system.

I previously had no problems with my internet in my last place so I figured it must be my router, so I replaced it with one from Apple. Streaming movies was just annoying with buffering every 15 minutes so I added an extender which helped but it still buffered several times a night, and my smart TV was useless.  I was pondering different ways to resolve the problem when I came across the eero on the internet.  I knew I would ultimately spend as much money troubleshooting the problem so I figured why not give it a try. So glad I did, no more buffering and the picture quality alone is worth it.  And my smart TV now responds with my amazon prime streaming.  Absolutely pleased and amazed! ",
"Conner S.","December 5, 2016 ",5.0,"I don't usually review amazon products, but when I do it's because they're flawless. I had the eero system for all of 15 minutes before I had it out of the box and set up. The unboxing experience can only be described as &#34;Apple-Like,&#34; with the box design clearly able to guide the user towards which pieces to take out first without having to read any instructions. After I had downloaded the app, setting up each node took ~4 minutes, for a total of approximately 12 minutes between unplugging my old modem and connecting my devices to the new network. Once the system was set up, the app then proceeded to do a speed test on its own as if to say, &#34;See what you've been missing?&#34;    My entire life it feels like, we have been struggling with sub-par wifi connectivity at the far ends of my house, but no more. In a spot where I would have been lucky to receive 3Mbps down this morning, I now get upwards of 30Mbps, which is actually the speed that we are paying for. Until today, I had been telling my parents it's normal to only get 10% of the bandwidth you were paying for, because it was, but no longer!    So far in my &#60;1hr using the setup, it seems pretty sweet. I'll be sure to update this if I run into any issues after a week. ",
"Curtis E Smith","April 30, 2016 ",5.0,"It's a bit pricy for extremely limited security controls. There is no ability to manage it from any desktop\laptop computer. I strongly disagree with the App only approach to managing the devices, as many people would be more comfortable with a mouse and a full keyboard. The functionality is there, and switching from AP to AP is seamless. Overall it works as advertised, it's easy to setup due to it's lack of feature control. You really can't change anything other than the password and the SSID, so it's nearly impossible to misconfigure. The use of bluetooth for initial configuration is pretty intelligent, and made it much easier than trying to connect to the default IP address. There are no mounting brackets, so it needs to be placed on the floor or a shelf. PoE would be a nice feature, as getting the right length and hiding cat cable is much easier than dealing with a power cable.    Overall I think the product is really good at it's intended purpose, which is to extend a wireless network beyond a single AP. Do it so that anyone can set it up, and have it work. They have covered those objectives. I think for the price they are charging, they could have added some additional management, and the ability to properly place\hide them in the home. Beyond WiFi that works, I really don't want to see the devices. ",
"Mark C.","July 3, 2016 ",5.0,"I truly labored over which home wifi mesh system to buy.  I heavily researched Eero, Google Wifi, Plume, Amplifi, and Orbi.  I thoroughly changed my mind several times but never felt completely decided.  I liked Eero from the start, but was put off by the price.  Would have gone with Google Wifi but the performance didn't measure up.  Amplifi was an early pick but ultimately the unsightly style of the remote antenna turned me away.  And despite Orbi's superior speed, those things are HUGE to leave sitting out on the table.  Ultimately I was sold by Eero's amazing commitment to service, support, and features.  The latest 2.0 firmware upgrade has seen significant performance improvements.    We have a central column in the middle of our townhouse with plumbing, AC, walls, etc. that notoriously blocked the central upstairs' wifi signal to much of the downstairs.  Where we did get signal it was degraded and slow.  Out of the box last night I had the first device up and connected via the app in under 10 minutes.

"George P. Burdell","July 5, 2016 ",4.0,"Over the past decade, I've tried various WiFi gear from most of the well known major network device manufacturers to create an extended home WiFi network. In almost every case, the setup was usually problematic requiring multiple attempts to get everything configured.  Then, once everything was set up, I was still left lacking with spotty dead zones.  Thereafter, I could pretty much count on one or more of the extended WiFi nodes to stop responding periodically, thus requiring either a reboot or worst case a reset and completely starting over with reconfiguring it.  Ugh!  What a hassle!  In the end, the best case scenario I had was 3 or 4 individual extended WiFi networks that I had to connect / disconnect between as I roamed throughout my home, each time experiencing a network bandwidth speed cut in half as result of extending the network.  Bleeh!    Then about a year ago, while searching for a better solution, I heard about the upcoming release of eero, a new WiFi based on mesh technology. Since then, I have been anxiously awaiting for the product release. When I finally received it, I couldn't believe how simple the setup was. It was so brain dead easy. Within 30 minutes, I had replaced my problematic, multiple WiFi networks with a single, consolidated WiFi network. It's been  Now, I don't even think about my WiFi.

As the Direct TV guy was setting up the sets we could not get them connected to my home Comcast router even though it was nearby and had a tested 30Mbps download speed.  Just as we were struggling to get connected the doorbell rang and my Eero three pack showed up from Amazon.  Speed was of the essence so I looked at the directions and went to work.  In less than 10 minutes I set up the three units - number one attached to the Comcast cable modem,  number two downstairs and number three on the main floor.  I downloaded the Eero app and bingo the network was visible on my phone and iPad.  I gave it a name and a password and then tried the TVs again.  Bot immediately connected.  Not only that, but I could even stream 4K on demand programs right away.  Now the entire house has a very strong signal (there are three floors but I didn't even have to put one upstairs).

I have seamless, fast, rock-solid coverage throughout my house. It was very easy to set up, and the app is understandable. eero is lightyears ahead of anything else. I was reminded of this again yesterday when I set up a Belkin wifi in my daughter's dorm room (I had to go with one of the access points &#34;recommended&#34; by the university).    When I got home from taking my daughter back to school yesterday, the electricity went out at our house, reminding me of another advantage of the eero. In the past, with the Airport Time Capsule, the electricity would go out. When it came back, I would have to go into my office and restart components in the right order to get them to come back up. This often took 30 minutes or so. Not yesterday. When the system went down, I received an email. When it came back up, it took about 3 minutes or so, but it all reset itself so that we were back on line.

kingmi,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"Has greatly improved my wifi experience!  I was dubious about this product when I first heard about it. I read five or six reviews and saw their tests and still thought....yeah, I will be wasting money.  The review that changed my mind was someone that had Comcast, and lived in an older building with the type of walls I do. Reviewer mentioned how this improved the service and does not blame Xfinity for the problems as much as he used to. That intrigued me enough to spend a decent amount of money.    Got the box and had a small issue with setup. While setting up the first unit by the router, there was a failure message after I named the location for it. Stated it could not locate it any more. I tried a few times to figure out how to reset it, before I realized that it was back online and working well.  Not blaming the system for this - minor issue that I easily resolved. Had the whole setup done in 20 mins...and most people would have it done a lot quicker than that.    Here is the con - and the reason for 4 stars. I did email Tech support.  I mentioned in the email that the eero speed test on the computer site was a bad link. (I could test it on my phone, but I really wanted to test it on my laptop in different parts of the apartment.  I also asked if there is a detriment of putting the units too close together.  Some parts of eero stated they should be 40 feet away, but when one of mine wasn't being located that far away, it recommended putting it closer and said 30 feet away. So, I was curious on since I was only using two of the three units, what would be the negatives of having them closer together and using three.  I think it was three or four days later I got a reply that my network speeds are great and they recommend not changing the setup.  That is good info to have, but it didn't answer the two issues.  1) speed test link on their site is not working  2) what is the negative of putting them closer together.  This may seem trivial  and if I could give 4.5 stars, I would...but if I email with questions, I kinda want the answers - especially if the app and site gave two different distances, and the site provides a link that does not work.    Back to positive stuff:  My internet since moving to this apartment and switching to the demon spawn known as Comcast has been horrible. I couldn't watch Netflix at certain times of the day, and even had buffering issues on Youtube. Sometimes basic loading of sites were annoyingly long.  Set up this unit, and have had no buffering issues at all. I am getting the download speeds for the actual internet package I bought.  Very easy set up.  For someone that lives online, and gets most of their entertainment from online, this is a blessing. Even my PS4 has no trouble staying online (with gameplay or even just downloading updates).    The price seems a bit high, but for the situation I am in, and for how much I am online, I am 100% fine with the price of this product. ",

K.F.,"March 11, 2016 ",4.0,"Despite a few hiccups, the system has been great.    My setup: I have a ~1400 sq ft, 2 story home. I bought 2 eeros so that I could place one downstairs (with my modem) and one upstairs where I used to have issues with connectivity. Prior to purchasing the eero system I had a tplink router and a tplink wifi extender plugged in upstairs. This worked in some cases but I had issues with devices dropping the network and even one device that would/could not connect to the wifi at all. My home has a second floor hallway which is open to the first floor.    Pros: I am getting faster internet. Devices are no longer dropping off the network. All my devices can now connect. The eero looks sleek and the app is pretty easy to use.    Cons: The system seems to be a bit finicky when it comes to placement of the eeros. It said to have the eero at person level but the only way I could get the upstairs eero to connect was to move the downstairs eero up onto a ~8 ft high shelf. Now, the two eeros have line of sight without any walls but it was still a little bit of a dance to get them to &#34;see&#34; each other. Maybe once you have them connected you can move them more easily. I don't have a need to since it works as is, but it wasn't as straight forward a process as I had hoped. Enough to make it not worth it? No. Enough to mention? I think so. Also I messed up connecting an ethernet switch, but once I explained my problem, it was updated on the help site.

"Andrew Stuckey","August 6, 2016 ",5.0,"I gotta say I am impressed with this system.  Crazy easy to set up and no more large router with antenna sticking out everywhere in my living room.  Like most, I was concerned about the cost of the product for a company/brand that I have never heard of.  But I've been tired of my existing Wifi network so I knew I was going to go with a full system rather than a standalone router.    My setup: 17 wireless devices and 5 wired over a house that is 2-story/3200 sq ft with 200 mbps service.  Modem and router is in the back of the house on the main floor.  So upstairs toward the front of the house really struggled with speeds.  Range was fine but speeds weren't good enough because those are the bedrooms.  My house is newly built in 2015 so the materials in the wall aren't an issue.  Just the distance and plus its much better to have a router upstairs so the signal can filter down rather than downstairs trying to send the signal up.  However, I don't have a choice because of where my only cable line comes in the house (satellite everywhere else).  Over the last year, I've used Airport Extreme, Netgear Nighthawk (all of them) and Onhub.  I've been using the Nighthawk X6 the past few months.  Powerful, but overkill especially when you still have weak spots in the house.  So over the past couple weeks started looking again when I had to start rebooting the router a couple times a week for it to give me my proper speeds.  I had 3 choices: Amplifi, Eero and Google Wifi (when it comes out).  I didn't consider Orbi or Luma.  So I went with Eero.  I was up and running in 10 mins.  Unplug modem, hook up eero.  Power up everything and setup on app.  Done.  I made my SSID and password the same as my other router and all of the other devices immediately connected without issue.    So far my speeds have been great all over the house.  Everything loads fast.  As I get further away from the router connected to the modem the speeds drop a little but not by much.  And that is what makes it better than a regular range extender.  You get range AND speed.  They're not hardwired to each other so the speeds I get are excellent considered.  App is great and simple.  Light years ahead of Netgear's Genie app in terms of UI.  Almost everything that's out is ahead of that ;)    Couple things I wish it had:    1. Additional Ethernet port  2. Ability to create different SSIDs for 5GHZ and 2.4GHZ bands    For someone who wants a lot of advanced options that you would find in a Nighthawk router then you probably won't be pleased with this.  But I really just wanted something I set up, add a guest network and be done.  I don't care about QoS functionality and stuff like that.  So I'll see how this continues to work over the next few weeks and update my review accordingly.  Really with this, price is the major deal breaker for most.  If you can get by that, you should be fine with your purchase.  My review is more like 4.5/5. ",

Bill,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"This is simply an exceptional product.  In summary, it was relatively easy to set up and provides strong, fast coverage across my home.      Prior to installing, download the app and set your phone to cellular with bluetooth on (turn off wifi on your phone).  Follow directions setting up the base device (I believe they are exactly the same but I will refer to the 1st device as the base).  You might want to conduct a software update at this time but I'm not sure it really matters.  Let the app lead you thru the set up of your satellite devices which should be line of sight and 40 feet or so away.  I did run into problems with the second phase as I was experiencing a bluetooth glitch.  I eventually called tech support which was fantastic!  They quickly answered and solved the issue.  The completion of the set up was a breeze from that point on.  I was told that this wasn't a common issue but its nice to know that the support line was this good.    I was working off of an Apple time capsule prior to installing the Eero device and it lost coverage and speed across the my house.  The difference is simply striking!  I could average 5 - 20 Mbs download depending upon the room I was in except for the extreme points in the house where is was a crap shot as to signal.  Now my coverage is 25 - 40 Mbs in the far reaches of my home.  Note: the Eero app seems to test your potential speed not the actual speed (it seems to regularly give 60Mbs as metric).  So I was using another speed test.    Again, simply a fantastic purchase and I am very happy with it across the board ",
Seewolf,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I spent a lot of time looking at different mesh systems and settled on the eero. I couldn't be happier.    I previously had multiple wifi networks in my home to provide full coverage over the three floors. I spent quite a bit of time looking at systems from Ubiquiti and Luma. I purchased an Ubiquiti system that was open box and one of the three access points was giving me trouble so I ended up returning it. The Luma system I had on order was promised for months and never arrived. Thank you to Amazon for helping me get that straightened out. Luckily for me, the delay gave me a chance to read reviews of bot the eero and Luma system and I decided to pay the extra money for the eero system.    I'm lucky that my home has an extensive wired network in place so I was able to install all three pieces with wired connections - one on each level of the home. I now have fast and strong connections in every room of my home with no dead spots and no need to change from one network to another. The ability to see every device (wired and wireless) in the house is great. My previous main wireless router was the SkyDog system and I got used to having easy access to turn on and off individual devices and assign them to groups. This is great when the kids are spending too much time online and need a gentle reminder that it is time to put the electronics away (although it isn't really that gentle when there access is suddenly shut off!).    I've been very happy with the speed of the wifi. My home currently has 80Mbps broadband. My previous system never came close to this speed but I now routinely see the full 80Mbps through speedtest.net or fast.com (when the wifi traffic on the network is low).    A couple of things I would like to see:  - The ability to hide the SSID. There is currently no way to turn off the transmission of the network name. I usually keep this hidden, in a dense neighborhood I see this as one extra layer of security.  - A filter for web content. This is one thing I loved about the SkyDog system (RIP) and one of the big reasons I initially had a Luma system on order but am so happy with the rest of the system the I'm willing to deal with that. By the way, as of the writing of this review I have a friend who did get the Luma system and has been disappointed so far since (according to them) the filter function is not yet active.    Overall, I would recommend this system to anyone who needs a robust mesh network to cover a larger home or small office. ",
BrenGlenn,"March 18, 2017 ",5.0,"I live in a 100 year old house with plaster walls though out. we've tried every sort of signal booster. Finally, I happened upon eero while browsing Amazon Launchpad.  Read every review, not kidding, before deciding to pop for a $500 maybe-solution.  It came in the mail. I had little time to open it and even less time to install.  Left it on my countertop for the weekend.  Later that evening, while I was out, I receive this text from my 18 year-old son, &#34;Installed new wifi thing. Speed Comparison: Formula 1 vs. Prius.&#34;  I couldn't tell you actual speed difference in numbers, but, can tell you I noticed marked decrease in loading times and no burping Netflix (ugh, hate movies that don't play).  I have two teens with gadgets galore.  They are no longer complaining.  Anyone want to buy a box full of wifi boosting crap that didn't work? ",
"Amazon Customer","October 7, 2016 ",5.0,"Even though I had purchased a high end router, I found I still needed to use a range extender ((also high end) to cover all areas of our 1800 sq ft main level with full basement home. I was having two continuing issues. First issue, I was having to reboot the system often, sometimes more than once daily. Secondly, because I had the router in the basement and the range extender on the main level, when I walked from the main level (connected to the range extender) to the basement, the phone would automatically switch connection to the router. When I returned upstairs, the phone would remain connected to the router which was not strong enough strength to do anything so I would have to go to wifi settings on the phone & manually select it for the range extender. Not a big deal unless you travel to the basement like I do probably 20 times daily.    I stumbled on something discussing the Eero system and then read many reviews on them and other whole house wifi systems. I decided to purchase a three Eero pack. It was super easy to install, it has been over three months and I have not had to reboot one time, and because my phone sees it as one wifi connection, I can now travel throughout the house with strong signal strength and internet speed.    I have one in the basement, one on the main level, and the third one connected to an older TiVo that does not have wireless connection - connected to the Eero ethernet port.    For me, it proved to be the end of frustration  of a system that just wasn't working well. ",
"J. Michael","May 9, 2016 ",5.0,"My home is a very tricky environment for WiFi. Lots of walls, awkward corners, obstacles, etc.    Even though the distance from my legacy router (Apple AirPort Extreme) to my home office was only 30 feet, I had zero WiFi connectivity in my home office.    I purchased eero to solve my home office WiFi problem after reading about eero from Walt Mossberg's review. Game changer decision.    Immediately after installing eero (which took almost no time), I had 100% WiFi connectivity in my home office! It's difficult to express the joy this brought me after suffering through crappy WiFi since I moved into my home. It's as simple and effective as eero proclaims.    If I could rate eero six stars, I would. ",
"sean jensen","February 16, 2017 ",5.0,"Dead simple. Plug the first node into your gateway. Connect to the wireless signal with your phone. Walk away until the signal is less than optimal. Drop another node at the threshold of great to OK. Power it up. Repeat. When you're done, you're done. I've been using eeros for months now in a long, sprawling ranch-style house, and have had ZERO issues. They simply update themselves. I can check the status of the network from my phone, and trigger speed tests on it. I've set up a guest network with two clicks, and can always see what devices are on which network. I've left my ISP's wireless broadcast on, but it's never interfered. No more band hopping, channel tuning, MAC filtering, and all the other tech finagling that have been part of connected life for the past decade. At first I kinda missed the tinkering, but no more. WiFi can now be taken for granted. ",
Rzaman,"March 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Absolutely amazed at how this transformed my life. No longer do I have to hear complaints from the family about how they are not getting a signal. Now, not only a signal, but a strong one. Easily tripled the speed, and in fact, I actually am getting a higher speed in some rooms that I am paying for.  I was a little skeptical about how easy the setup was after reading most of the reviews. I was preparing for a rough afternoon of banging my head against the wall dealing with setup. I asked my wife to run to the store to pick up a 6 pack of beer to make the process less painful.... Believe it or not, I actually had the entire eero setup before she got home. I set up 4 units in my home and have completely trouble free WIFI now. ",
Jase,"September 8, 2016 ",5.0,"Our home is not especially large, but we did have trouble with WiFi when using a &#34;top-of-the-line,&#34; conventional wireless router.  With eero, WiFi is as strong in our back yard as it is coming out of the wall.    I had read that I could place my old wireless router in &#34;bridge mode&#34; so that it could simply serve as the required cable modem for my eero.  I was a little worried because I'm not very tech savvy, and that sounded like something could easily go wrong.  So I decided to just forget about bridge mode, and run the eero without disabling the WiFi features of my old router.  In our case, the eero works flawlessly alongside the old router.  Less than 15 minutes to get all three up and running.    The best thing about our WiFi environment with eero is that it just disappears from our daily thoughts.  We just enjoy as much WiFi as we want, wherever we want.    Highest recommendation. ",
"Bryan Tackett","January 17, 2017 ",5.0,"We live in a duplex down condo that was just not being served effectively by our Apple AirPort Extreme. I took that chance in buying this and am so glad I did. Setup was extremely simple - took me less than 15 minutes to get everything up-and-running. We've had no issues with reliability of connection or speed or loss of bandwidth. This blankets our 1800SF with no dead spots. And that's important since my Verizon cell signal won't reach far into the condo, especially downstairs in my office. This allows me to seamlessly connect to the WiFi, affording me the ability to make calls over WiFi on my cell. Absolutely recommend this amazing system! ",
"Amazon Woman","January 24, 2017 ",5.0,"It was easy to setup.  I have Verizon fios and I did have to call Verizon to recognize my eero.  Once the Verizon rep allowed the device it was smooth sailing. Just saved $120 whoopee!!  I placed the main router in the dining room where my computer is setup temporarily and another in master bedroom.  It did take a abt 12 hours for the bedroom router to start taking on devices.  the main reason I purchased this system is because I was having issue streaming to the bedroom from downstairs the TV kept dropping the connection.  Its still happening after talking to eero and vizio support Vizio is replacing my TV so I will update this after I have the new TV. ",
Tom,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"The detectors are great. They work as advertised and are easily monitored and controlloed from my cell phone.    The setup is where they could have done better. I bought 5 of these and wanted them all to be interconected. They are and it works great. However, they fail to tell you that you have to activate each detector in the chain when seting up a new one. Even the scond and third from the original three pack. When setting these up, after activating it it tells you to go ahead and install it. If you do you will have to get it and activate it for the setup of the new detector to complete. I had to have all four in the chain going when I set up the fifth.    So, If you're installing more than one of these. Sit at a table and do all the setup at once while your comfortable. I would have rate these five stars, but I think this is a VERY MAJOR flaw in the set up. I don't believe they're unaware of the problem, so there doing this on purpose. Not what I'm looking for in a tech company. ",
Marcin,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Mostly met expectations. Not quiet as easy setup. Have a decent size 2400 sq ft home though line of site from room to open space poses challenges when setting up the mesh. Not as easy as just putting the access points to spread across the whole house. Though overall mak s it easier for hose less savvy with technology.    For those of us more savvy, a bit limited with what I like to setup for port forwarding or access restrictions. We are having a hallenge with Fios and eliminating the Fios router completely. Won't let us use eero as the direct connection. Either a lot mutation or some issue with the Ethernet jack from the street.    Will need further testing to see this Fios compatibility.  Otherwise working well and keeps a significantly fast connection. ",
"Greg Cooper","October 25, 2016 ",4.0,"I had huge doubts when I began to set these up because the second one I tried to setup was struggling to connect to the first. I did a little reading and they suggest keeping them within line-of-sight of one another. This isn't really possible in my apartment unless I owned maybe 8 or 9 of them and then it would just be an apartment covered in eeros and plugs, not something I want. Fortunately, I was able to position it just outside of line-of-sight and was able to get them to connect. The following morning, however, they had disconnected from one another again which got me insanely worried but they did reconnect without me doing anything other than restarting the first one.    However, since that initial hiccup, it has been unbelievably good. I was previously running a Netgear Nighthawk C7000 and an R7000 (separately across months) and both failed miserably. Neither of these routers are particularly cheap either which made it all the more annoying. My best speed with the R7000, which was the router I was using before switching to eeros, was maxing out at about 190 Mbps in the room where it was located. The speed instantly rocketed up to 290 Mbps which is faster than I'm actually paying for, no one tell Comcast.    I purposefully get a WiFi spot check in various rooms before making the switch so I could get an accurate read out on whether or not the eeros actually improved my network reliability or speed. Here's some of the changes averaged out across 3 tests lasting 10 seconds each (rooms with an eero in them have been marked as such):    Living room (eero): 190 Mbps to 290 Mbps  Kitchen: 110 Mbps to 200 Mbps  Bathroom: 75 Mbps to 145 Mbps  Master bedroom (eero): 15 Mbps to 120 Mbps (the original speed was actually a major reason I looked into eeros)  Second bedroom: 45 Mbps to 150 Mbps    (The remaining eero is located in my hallway, which I never tested before hand)    On top of the speed improvements, it also allowed me to wire in certain devices which have rather poor connections regardless of WiFi speed such as a PS4, Roku, and Apple TV. A major improvement was the reliability of my Philips Hue box. Since I could now put it in a more reasonable location than my living room (which had no bulbs in it), I'm now able to use my Hue bulbs very consistently without bulbs disconnecting from the box.    I've been raving about these to friends and family like crazy and I plan to purchase another three to really create a ridiculous home network with an eero in my second bedroom, kitchen, and maybe at the opposite end of my hallway (I have an T shaped hallway). You should buy! ",
"Amazon Customer","August 13, 2016 ",4.0,"I live in San Francisco in an old 1906 home. Wifi has always been an issue in this house. I had come to accept that I would not get internet in some areas of the house which seems so weird in San Francisco.  I'm glad my friends recommended eero even though at first I did not believe the hype. Once purchased, the set up of the 3 pack eero system took about 10 minutes. I placed them in three locations on three different floors of my house- ground floor, kitchen (1st floor), and the living room on the 2nd floor. Immediately (well after the system boots up) I had a stronger wifi connection in all the areas where I was previously able to connect to the internet. Additionally I now have internet in all the areas where I literally could not even open a web page before. Upload and download speeds are much faster. Love it so far! ",
"Reed H","July 21, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought a 3 pack as a Christmas/House warming gift for my son who just moved into a 3 story home and was hoping he already had a good system for their new home and I would be able to keep the eero.  No such luck as he hooked it up in no time and was excited about the speed and that it found his nest thermostat and smoke detectors.  They also have a studio living space above their detached garage that they will rent out and promised all utilities and didn't have a solution for wifi.  This solved that issue.    That night in the guest bedroom on the third floor I tried a speed test and only registered 4.44 download and 1.45 upload. I wasn't impressed until I realized I was on their old wifi.  I switched to the eero network a minute later and registered 119.69 download and 6.20 upload.  He is on Xfinity cable.    So I had to get one for myself for our three story  home  with basement and lathe and plaster walls.  I no longer have to hold my iPad up in the air, pointing to the door if I try to read email in bed!  My download speeds there went from 3.5 to 89.4.  I'm also on cable.    I did have a little trouble setting it up and called their support on New Year's Eve in the morning and they didn't give me a bad time when I figured out that I hadn't screwed the cable into the modem properly as it was merely dangling like chad on a Florida ballot!  I was up and running right away!    Get the full use of your internet speed!! ",
Lorac,"May 24, 2016 ",5.0,"The eero has changed everything in our household.  We have a 5,000 square foot home with 3 floors to cover.  The house is long and the cable modem and old router were in the office at the furthest end of the house.  We used high-quality updated routers with after-market antennas yet we still could not keep a decent enough signal at the opposite end of the main floor to run a webcam in the dining room (furthest point from router in office).  In addition we couldn't get adequate signal upstairs or in the basement.  With 10 ft. ceilings it made the distance to upstairs even further.  In the basement only one room directly under the router could get a decent signal.  eero has changed everything for us with respect to multiple dead zones and signal strength.  We used a 3-pack of EERO on the main floor only.  One where the old router was located at one end of the house, another in near the middle of the main floor and the third at the other end (dining room) of the main floor.  The signal strength is so good now we can use any wireless device, including phones, cameras, Hue lights and computers consistently on the main floor.  But.... what we didn't necessarily expect is that with these 3 units spread across the main floor the signal strength is good enough to cover the entire second floor as well as the entire basement.  I checked all areas using the WiFi Analyzer app on my android phone.  We even have signal strength in the garage to install a wifi security camera there as well.  Now we can use an iPad in the basement living room.  We can use any device in the bedrooms upstairs.  This product is extremely easy to set-up.  All you do is plug the first one in and do what your phone app tells you to do to set up the other two units.  It helps you place them appropriately.  We aren't using all features yet, but we plan to give priority to our OOMA voip telephone (also connected via wifi) so voice traffic gets priority over other traffic.  The units look nice on top of furniture or a desk.  I highly recommend an eero 3-pack for large homes! ",
DukMan,"January 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I find this to be a great product. While I am not a system engineer, I am slightly 'techie' and was in need of a new router and this was recommended to me by my son. I did the research and felt this would meet my needs. My two previous routers never delivered the speed or the coverage, in fact one was 2 months old and I was very upset with the 'over promise and under deliver'. The EERO has been an absolute winner from the minute I installed it.    The setup was very easy. I did need to call support and it was very helpful and I was up and running in 30 minutes. The speed is fantastic and I have double the coverage from previous. I just can't imagine how it could be easier or better than the experience I have had so far. ",
rosenkav1,"July 18, 2016 ",5.0,"Overall, I enjoyed a very easy, snag-free installation process with Eero.  I also bought the 3-Eero pack and a new modem at the same time.  I don't know how much of the improvement to internet speed over wifi that I've enjoyed since installing both can be credited to Eero versus the new modem or the combination of the two, but we do seem to have far better speed and coverage throughout our house.  We do not pay for business-class service through our cable provider, just a slightly upgraded conventional service, but before installing Eero, my internet connection in my office upstairs was slow as molasses -- online speed tests showed download speeds of anywhere from 2 to 6 Mbps, and now I'm consistently around 50 Mbps, according to the Eero app.  We've had only the occasional hiccup with streaming music or video entertainment with the new setup, most of which we do in the upstairs areas of our house.  My only gripe, and it's no fault of the Eero, is that I had to reinstall all three of our Nest smoke detectors after setup, which required pulling them out of the ceiling and resetting them all.  At least climbing up and down the ladder all those times made for some good exercise. ",
ianoid,"January 18, 2017 ",5.0,"It works great. It was simple to setup. Just put a little thought about where you place the base units. They are supposed to be in line of sight from one another, but just not being too far apart (15 feet?) is sufficient. The three I have downstairs blanket the upstairs with WiFi now, where most of the rooms would fall short in the past. If I had a problem, I'd move a base unit upstairs.    I have tried all manner of routers like the Nighthawk and other high powered single routers. I am done buying more routers. I'm sticking with this Eero.    If your house is really big,  you may want to buy extra base stations. It's not magic, but it's definitely a better setup than any single router solution I've experienced. ",
gregf1082,"February 15, 2017 ",5.0,"I purchased  3 pack several weeks ago to replace an old set of routers I had at my previous house.  I moved to a 2000 square foot ranch house that is spread out more than my old house. The old routers and extenders were not handling everything thoughout the house and yard.  When I moved I purchased a 75MB service.  The best service I could get from the old routers inside the house was 29MB.  After hearing about EERO on the podcast IOS Today I started reading the reviews for the EERO over several weeks I finally decided to purchase the 3 pack.  It was amazing how easy it  was to install the three units.  I did not have any probems getting them up and running. The modem is down in the basement so the first EERO is down there next to the modem.. The next one is on the main level in the middle of the house to the front of the house in the office.  The third one is about 30 feet away from the one in the basement but on the main level on the back side of the house.  Coverage is fantastic inside the house, the garage  and out in the front yard and back yard!  I now receive the 75MB that I am paying for and have great coverage everywhere!  I like the idea that the system will be updated automatically.  Everyone in the family is happy that we have made the move to EERO! ",
"Michael Brown","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"Very happy customer here!  I first heard of the eero system from the Cult of Mac podcast (if you're an Apple fan and haven't heard it yet, I highly suggest you give it a go).  One of the podcasters was raving about how the eero had massively improved the wifi coverage in his home, and I was instantly intrigued.  My house is about 1,300 square feet and the modem sits in one corner while the Apple TV sits in the diagonally opposite corner.  Before eero, shows on Netflix, Amazon, etc. would constantly pause to buffer, which of course can be quite frustrating.  The price tag for the three-pack eero system is a hefty one, no denying that, but I justified the purchase because I had some Amazon gift cards that covered half of the cost...and I'm very glad I made that purchase!  Setup was so easy: download the app to your phone and it walks you through in a matter of minutes.  It's suggested that you place your eero devices within sight of each other, but the physical structure of my house makes that impossible.  I have one in each opposite corner, plus one in the hallway in the middle of the house.  It works perfectly!  I will note that the first day I used the system, I noticed a couple of times the blinking light on the devices that indicated loss of connectivity.  However, during that first night the system did its initial software update (so cool that it does it on its own!), and ever since then it's been running flawlessly.  Strong wifi signal throughout the house, zero loss of connectivity, zero spontaneous Netflix bufferings.  If you can swallow the cost of the device, stop thinking about it and just buy it! ",
"Erin Souza","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Amazing product - so easy to set up and understand. Unlike an extender which basically just screws with your Sonos and doesn't actually provide an extension of usable wifi - EERO actually broadened my wifi capability. We have 3 cottages on our farm in addition to the main house and now all buildings have great wifi! Strong enough bandwidth for our family members staying over to watch Netflix and/or hold video conferences from their cottage.    Love this product - I wish all my new technology worked as seamlessly and reliably. Great job! ",
Srinivasa,"August 9, 2016 ",5.0,"My home is split over 3 levels. I have a 300 mbps connection which I could never receive reliably or at any significant speed down in the basement. After trying out numerous alternatives (routers, access points, extenders, and power line adapters), I stumbled on eero. I now have 4 of them spread over the house and get the expected 300 mbps from anywhere the house. An expensive proposition at $600 for 4 units -- but boy -- has it been worth it !!    The installation process is super slick and I can see that this will be how setup applications will be in the future -- with a fancy app that guides you at every step and knows what you are doing. A couple of weeks or so after I had installed the eero units, I decided to turn off the WIFI on the router provided by the cable company. This actually improved the performance and reliability of the entire eero system and I suggest everyone do this.    One odd thing that I have noticed is that if the internet connection goes down, the eero that is connected to the router gets very hot. I mean really HOT -- and it may be something the eero folks need to worry about -- perhaps some venting slits in the side or the top of the unit may be required to prevent damage to the unit if the internet connection goes down for extended periods of time.    Apart from this observation regarding an edge condition -- I think the eero is a game changer and a truly amazing product. ",
"Ariel Benzakein","March 31, 2016 ",5.0,"I replaced an Amplifi HD with a 3 eero setup because the Amplifi HD only supports 30 wireless devices (I have 35 now and will be adding more for home automation) and the eero supports up to 128.  I have FiOS 500 up/500 down, so there is plenty of bandwidth to support everything.  The eero is pretty easy to set up - all plug & play; the trick is in positioning the satellite systems in optimal locations.  My house is about 3400 sq ft and I now have solid WIFI everywhere.  I found the throughput to be a lot better on the Amplfii, but the eero is pretty good too (nothing below 120 down in any corner of my house, which is certainly fast enough). ",
"David Aldis","August 29, 2016 ",5.0,"I have to start by stating that I'm using this in Europe, which right now is not the intended market for the Eero. To register the device you have to enter a US cell number , even though it's unnecessary. The power brick is universal voltage, but apparently using it on 240v voids the warranty.  All that aside, it works really well in my very old stone house with very thick walls. We don't have a great internet speed so that hasn't improved, but the internal coverage and transfer speeds have gone up quite dramatically. I used to use powerline adapters, but Eero beats those into the ground.  It's very easy to set up too, notwithstanding the registration issue. My mum could probably do it.  So, expensive, but a good system. ",

The list includes linksys 1900, 3200, asus ac5300, netgear nighthawk x6 all with access points from various manufactures. None of these product worked for my 5000 sq ft home. I bought eeros thinking of it did not work I would return. After installing the product I can say it is the best wireless solution I have ever owned. The installation and setup  Was simple and quick. I am getting near 100mps speeds in most parts of my home with the worst speed I tested was 40mps. I was even able to control my music from my Apple TV outside my home in my backyard. Great solution, I highly recommend purchasing if you have a large home. ",

No matter what combination of repeaters, repositioning the wifi basestation, etc., we could never get reliable wifi until eero.    It took maybe 10 minutes to set up their set of 3 eero stations.  Setup was very easy.    For the last month, my Mom has been able to stream netflix to her smart TV or iPad without any problems.  Previously, she was worried to use her cellular iPad for netflix, concerned that her wifi would drop and switch to cellular without her realizing it. Now, she's confident. ",

It could not be easier and, as they say, &#34;it just works.&#34;  If you are a computer scientist who programs routers and HTML code this might be too simplistic for you.  But for most of us - this thing rocks.  It is noticeably faster, completely stable (no drops at all), and I like how you can just shoot a guest a guest password link so they can use your wifi while they're there.  I used to have to switch routers as I walked around my house.  Now it's completely transparent.  Highly recommend.  The only negative is that it's expensive.

"Mark C.","October 3, 2016 ",5.0,"I truly labored over which home wifi mesh system to buy.  I heavily researched Eero, Google Wifi, Plume, Amplifi, and Orbi.  I thoroughly changed my mind several times but never felt completely decided.  I liked Eero from the start, but was put off by the price.  Would have gone with Google Wifi but the performance didn't measure up.  Amplifi was an early pick but ultimately the unsightly style of the remote antenna turned me away.  And despite Orbi's superior speed, those things are HUGE to leave sitting out on the table.  Ultimately I was sold by Eero's amazing commitment to service, support, and features.  The latest 2.0 firmware upgrade has seen significant performance improvements.    We have a central column in the middle of our townhouse with plumbing, AC, walls, etc. that notoriously blocked the central upstairs' wifi signal to much of the downstairs.  Where we did get signal it was degraded and slow.  Out of the box last night I had the first device up and connected via the app in under 10 minutes.  Same for the other two, and I have 5 bars of wifi in every corner of my townhouse.  Speed everywhere has gone from 1-5 Mb to 40-80 Mb! ",
"Eric Z.","March 24, 2016 ",5.0,"My wife and I have an older, all masonry house with an addition that we occupy a great deal of the time. I mention this as that was our challenge. Location of a singular router could never satisfy seamless WiFi through out the structure. If we located router in the original structure, the newer half was shielded by the impenetrable all masonry wall. If we located the router in the newer addition, then vice versa. We knew there was no single unit solution. We also spend a great deal of time in the back yard...some 60 feet from the house.   We do not game, work a home office, and TV or video is limited to watching baseball...a lot of baseball! We are not very savvy with the details required to install our own mesh type system. So we were condemned to creating/buying a solution. We bought the doo dads that were going to boost, stretch, span, and solve all our WiFi woes.  This then that...nope, that didn't work. How about this antenna? No difference. Nothing that could be purchased and simply placed existed to solve our situation. Until Eero.   My wife had run across an article in the paper (crazy, huh? Well, it was the digital version!) discussing Eero. I took a look and read/researched all that I could.  There were some complaints about the cost. It was a stretch, but I figured if it actually worked 50% better than what we had, then it was less money than all we have spent so far on a system that supplies very sub par WiFi!  Before we purchased the Eero, I rather whimsically sent an email to their support including a floor plan our structure and desires from the WiFi system. I nearly fell out of my chair when there was a personal response some 3 hours later! Whoa...people answer support email? Really? It actually contained details of usefulness on where, how, and why to do what.  I responded with another diagram proposing the placement of Eero units. They responded ...AGAIN! OK. I am sold. I will buy this! I purchased a 3 pack. I knew we needed one each in the two halves of the house to cross the original dividing wall. The third I would try on the patio in an attempt to send a signal to the backyard.   We have a combined modem/router that we own. So first challenge was to log into the router and set it for bridge mode. Easy enough. We did have a limited amount of Ethernet CAT5 run through the structure. We set the first Eero (I like to call it the master as it configures things) in the newer half supplied by CAT5 from the bridged modem and then CAT5 downstream to our switch, both in the basement. We had previously downloaded the set up app and BOOM! We had WiFi in that half of the house. A second was placed (wireless) some 30' away in the older half, with signal fairly &#34;line of sight&#34; through a hall. BOOM! That half has WiFi! The third was placed on patio (wireless) and BOOM! The patio is humming! All worked flawlessly. We have some 14 devices being served. Even the Wemo works which had always been a persnickety little device!   The patio installation did not exactly serve the backyard area as we had hoped, but we knew it would be difficult. In an attempt to improve this situation, I had installed a CAT5 cable from the switch in basement to the patio. We &#34;forgot&#34; the patio Eero and moved it to a higher location on patio and plugged it into Ethernet. After it found the network and was all happy, BOOM! We had WiFi in the back yard...some 60' away! Last evening we streamed ball game audio and and MLB highlight videos without buffering or glitches.    We knew that 3 Eero would likely not service all of our structure due to it's dense and awkward arrangement. So yes, I bought another 3 pack! We have not installed the second 3 pack as yet, but suspect these will supply the balance of house...with ease.   To recapitulate:   Eero works. If you would like a very simple network without having to learn all the technical details to build your own, this is it. We now have coverage at speeds that match what we are paying for from our ISP. I read all of Eero's site listing ranges, how to locate, etc. I can confidently and honestly say, it performs better than advertised. The signal is reaching farther than recommended. We  are overwhelmingly happy with our Eero purchase! ",
Folkmeister,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"If your family complains / does not understand how to switch between the several access points and extenders you have lovingly set up in your house, then the EERO is for you!  If your teenagers are running up your data plan on their devices because the internet in your house is &#34;too slow&#34; or &#34;doesn't work&#34;,  then the EERO is for you too!  This is an awesome product that solved those problems for me.  I had one question during setup about how to change the default IP range (so that existing devices on my network with static IP addresses did not have to be reconfigured).

Paynar,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Love this thing. House is about 3700 sq ft and has some dead spots in corners and on back porch around pool. I have used the Netgear Plug-In Wi-Fi Range Extenders over the past year and yes they do work....problem with these is every time you move into another area that is covered by one you have to login into that extender so there is no smooth transition throughout the house. Someone recommended the eero system and after researching it I decided to take the leap and purchase it. It's amazingly simple to set up and speeds are improved, doubled in my situation compared to range extenders. I think it's a lot of money to drop down but after using it for a couple months I am very pleased and would do it again. NO switching to the closest extender anymore, just works wherever you go using the mesh network within your home. I have coverage in the dead spots and out by the pool. I have a Pentair pool wifi controller, WD My Cloud network drive and Sonos bridge all connected through a switch that is connected through the wired eero box. This was the only tricky part using the ATT gateway that is located in a not so ideal laundry room. You must have one of the eero boxes hardwired so I hooked mine up in the office (not the laundry room with the gateway directly) and it worked thankfully. Took a little work to reconnect devices to the new eero network (most people won't have this problem I'm guessing) and then everything was accessible. ",
"Meghan K Test","March 19, 2017 ",5.0,"Easy set up, works great.  Even bought a set for my in-laws who were having signal issues 25 feet from their Fios router.  They have a split level home with the Fios modem/router in the basement near the stairs.  I put one Eero there and one on the main level at the back of the house.  They now have a good signal all over the inside of the house and out back on the deck as well.  I live in a 3 level colonial and get a great signal with just two Eeros - one on the main level at the right side of the house attached to the Fios modem/router and one in my closet (not even out in the open) in the top floor left side of the house.  I still get a decent signal about 150 feet in front of my house outside.  Such a great product for its ease of set up (10 minutes) and ability to easily name and choose a password for your network.  No more staying with the default network name and password that comes on the Verizon router because who the hell wants to take the time how to figure out how to connect to it to change it?  While I (35 year old guy) set up mine and my in-laws, I am confident that even my mom could figure this out and she still needs tutorial every time she wants to transfer photos from her camera to her PC.  One thing I noticed: they do get warm so keep it in the open air by itself and on a ventilated shelf if you can.  Enjoy! ",
xcv58,"July 21, 2016 ",5.0,"The good part is easy to setup.    And the signal is not good, especially compare with Airport Extreme. I set up 3 eero as a straight line. The 1st connects to my model. The 2nd, 3rd connect wirelessly. Then I connect my old Airport Extreme with 2nd eero.    I use iMac, two MacBook pro, iPhone, and iPad mini to test speed around 3rd eero. Only one of my MacBook Pro can get up to 70Mb speed around 3nd eero. All other devices can only get up to 40Mb speed. Especialy iMac, only get speed around 15Mb. But when I connect to my Airport Extreme (which connects to 2nd eero). I can get full speed (80Mb) for all my devices.    One more thing, it doesn't support IPv6!!!!!!    You spend $500 in 2016 to get the high-end wifi device that doesn't support IPv6 YET?    If you really need an easy setup wifi devices. I highly suggest Airport Extreme. With almost same price, better signal, and support IPv6. ",
"eero Support","September 21, 2016 ",5.0,"This product, other than the price, couldn't be more perfect. Had a 3 year old Belkin router (i know, sad) and needed an upgrade after dealing with buffering from the Apple TVs and overloaded access point from the Canary, Wemos and other smart devices... Took 20 minutes to set up and get things running. Outside the minor glitch of having to update the software on the main hub prior to getting a solid connection on the second eero in the office, it was seamless.    Have nearly a 60% increase in speed, and buffering is non-existent in the apple TVs. Looking forward to loading them up with 30 devices with the inlaws in the coming weeks and seeing the throughput. Love the idea, and after all of my research, glad I chose this instead of the Linksys, Google, Luma or all the other ones.    Highly recommend and would love to see whats coming next. ",
"Tyler Nielsen","September 3, 2016 ",2.0,"Its not as great as I was expecting it to be. I got the 3 pack and set them up as directed in the app which was pretty easy to do. It also does provide whole house coverage and we don't have problems with loosing connection to the wifi like we use to. Setup and whole house coverage are two features it does very well.    Here is where I am disappointed, the wifi signal is not as strong the further away you get from the main one like they advertise. I have a 150mbps plan with Comcast. The main hub that is connected to the modem, when I am near that one I have no problem getting the 150+. As I get to the furtherest one upstairs, my speed tests go down to anywhere from 50mbps to maybe 80mbps at most.    Second thing is the app is very lacking in features. First off, I previously had the Google Onhub and that app had great features such as telling me how much data a specific connected device used and you could even change the timeframe to see different lengths of times. Eero app does not have this feature. Second thing is the speed test feature inside the Eero app is worthless. I will use speedtest.net app and get 150mbps result, go straight to the Eero app and get 80mp if I'm lucky. Sometimes the Eero app will do a speed test and tell me 15mbps.    I am most likely returning these as the price tag is just way to high for something with less features than other routers and doesn't provide reliable speeds throughout the house. ",
RLP,"January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I switched to Comcast from ATT which had low speeds coming into house.  With ATT I was getting about the same speed wirelessly as wired (around 20 mbps average).

I called tech support and the folks were very nice, but they couldn't fix the problem.  Wired I get 300+ mbps, Wireless via eero system around 80 mbps.  Not what I expected and I sure woudn't spend this kind of money had I known.    I also don't have a modem / router combo in case you are thinking that I needed to setup router in bridge mode (which you do need to do if you have such a combo).

"eero support","July 23, 2016 ",3.0,"I started to leave 4 stars because of the price, but realized that that wasn't fair.  So 5 stars.    I've spent the last 10 years trying to get wifi to work in my parents' 1950s home.  No matter what combination of repeaters, repositioning the wifi basestation, etc., we could never get reliable wifi until eero.    It took maybe 10 minutes to set up their set of 3 eero stations.  Setup was very easy.    For the last month, my Mom has been able to stream netflix to her smart TV or iPad without any problems.  Previously, she was worried to use her cellular iPad for netflix, concerned that her wifi would drop and switch to cellular without her realizing it. Now, she's confident. ",
Pete,"June 5, 2016 ",2.0,"We picked this up on Prime Day, which I thought was a pretty good price.  We have had other extenders before, but with a normal extender it creates a new wifi name so your devices are constantly having to switch depending on where you are, and it causes issues with connected devices like our Sonos. Eero allows you to setup a seamless wifi system that has the same name regardless of where you are at in the condo, and allows all our connected devices to work seamlessly.  Overall I have been very happy, but there are a few things of note:     - The wifi signal does get slower (not by a ton) the farther you get away from the 1st unit, so I suggest putting that unit closest to your major bandwidth hogs   - We have had a few issues with the devices, which usually resolve themselves, but worse case you have to unplug them and plug them back in.  I will say that generally they work error free.   - They have a reasonable level of customization available, but if you have a lot of networking requirements I suggest you check out their site first.  I don't remember what it was that we lost when we ditched our old network, but I remember it was something we felt we could ultimately live with based on the extra convenience we were getting. ",
"Michael Elliott","October 3, 2016 ",5.0,"If I would've written a review within the first month or two it would've been five stars, hands down. Unboxing and setup are a breeze and the iPhone app is a nice touch. I'm glad I waited because after 3 or 4 months, something has happened and I'm worse off than I was before with a single point wifi router. I don't think the product deserves 5 stars. I agree with all the 5 star reviews for the first 3 months of owning the product.    Out of the blue, for no apparent reason, with no changes to my home, the Eero node placement, or number of devices connecting, I am suddenly getting random network outages, dropped wifi and reconnecting, I have to forget the network and re-join it, my printer 100% refuses to connect, I had to forcibly put in the MAC address with a DHCP reservation to get my Macbook Pro to connect. It is really disappointing. When it works, it's great, but it's becoming very inconsistent and I am having a 3 week long conversation with support to try to remedy the situation. They told me to try swapping one of the nodes with the one attached to the physical router. I tried that and it had no effect.

"Curtis E Smith","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"It's a bit pricy for extremely limited security controls. There is no ability to manage it from any desktop\laptop computer. I strongly disagree with the App only approach to managing the devices, as many people would be more comfortable with a mouse and a full keyboard. The functionality is there, and switching from AP to AP is seamless. Overall it works as advertised, it's easy to setup due to it's lack of feature control. You really can't change anything other than the password and the SSID, so it's nearly impossible to misconfigure. The use of bluetooth for initial configuration is pretty intelligent, and made it much easier than trying to connect to the default IP address. There are no mounting brackets, so it needs to be placed on the floor or a shelf. PoE would be a nice feature, as getting the right length and hiding cat cable is much easier than dealing with a power cable.    Overall I think the product is really good at it's intended purpose, which is to extend a wireless network beyond a single AP. Do it so that anyone can set it up, and have it work. They have covered those objectives. I think for the price they are charging, they could have added some additional management, and the ability to properly place\hide them in the home. Beyond WiFi that works, I really don't want to see the devices. ",

One of the features I like is that I can change the things I need to on the go with the iOS app (I wish the had one specific for the iPad) - it was nice to enable guest mode with out having to run back into the office and login to the router.

bobbyo23,"May 18, 2016 ",5.0,"Been looking forward to using the Eero's. Just set it up for a client today and it was the easiest thing to setup. I bought the 3 pack and placed one downstairs in their main living room where the modem was (Ethernet), another downstairs in an office on the other side of the house (via Ethernet drop), and another upstairs in the middle of the house. I get full bars everywhere I go with one SSID, and you can see your phone or other device properly hand off the connection. No need for &quot;5G&quot;, just one wireless network name, and poof, it works. Now there aren't any crazy network features here such as MAC filtering or anything. It's really basic in what options you have, but honestly it's perfect for most setups. However, if you do need certain professional features then you can always get a security appliance (firewall) that handles DHCP or static addressing and use the Eero in &quot;bridged&quot; mode just for your wireless network. A lot of people seem to complain about the price but guess what, if you buy any other wireless router, you'll need access points AND the wireless networks will have different SSIDs and won't handle the hand-off correctly for users. If you use repeaters... Well those stink and cut your bandwidth by half. This is totally worth every penny. The app works great too (I used it for iPhone) and I love the built in speed tests, monitoring of network, and ability to give guest access or main access on the fly. 5/5 would buy again. Definitely only using Eero in the future for my clients and myself. ",

"TCB IN A FLASH","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Four months ago I moved into a great pre-war condo in Chicago. The space is great, but the plaster/wire mesh walls KILLED my WiFi signal. I was previously running the latest gen Apple AirPort Extreme and even with another AirPort extreme operating as a repeater, my WiFi signal would not reliably extend across my 2,600 sqft apartment. I tried a few other solutions (more repeaters, moving the AirPort, and powerline WiFi) but nothing helped. I finally resolved to spend $2,500 having my house wired with cat6 cable outlets to spread additional wired routers across my place, but before pulling that trigger I rolled the dice and purchased the eero system. I have Amazon Prime, so I figured worst case I would just return it. No harm, no foul.    SO GLAD I DID!    The system took less than 15 minutes to set up and after just a little trial and error on where to put the devices, I had great WiFi across my place. No dead spots. No skipping video. My problem was just solved.    Thank the WiFi gods!    The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because 1) I do see a drop in overall speed in some areas of my house. Still WAAAAAAY better than before, but not nearly as strong as when I nearer the base station; and 2) the cost. Yes, it's cheaper than re-wiring my house, but $500 is a little high IMHO.

Tom,"January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"The detectors are great. They work as advertised and are easily monitored and controlloed from my cell phone.    The setup is where they could have done better. I bought 5 of these and wanted them all to be interconected. They are and it works great. However, they fail to tell you that you have to activate each detector in the chain when seting up a new one. Even the scond and third from the original three pack. When setting these up, after activating it it tells you to go ahead and install it. If you do you will have to get it and activate it for the setup of the new detector to complete. I had to have all four in the chain going when I set up the fifth.    So, If you're installing more than one of these. Sit at a table and do all the setup at once while your comfortable.

"Kevin White","July 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Over the past decade, I've tried various WiFi gear from most of the well known major network device manufacturers to create an extended home WiFi network. In almost every case, the setup was usually problematic requiring multiple attempts to get everything configured.  Then, once everything was set up, I was still left lacking with spotty dead zones.  Thereafter, I could pretty much count on one or more of the extended WiFi nodes to stop responding periodically, thus requiring either a reboot or worst case a reset and completely starting over with reconfiguring it.  Ugh!  What a hassle!  In the end, the best case scenario I had was 3 or 4 individual extended WiFi networks that I had to connect / disconnect between as I roamed throughout my home, each time experiencing a network bandwidth speed cut in half as result of extending the network.  Bleeh!    Then about a year ago, while searching for a better solution, I heard about the upcoming release of eero, a new WiFi based on mesh technology. Since then, I have been anxiously awaiting for the product release. When I finally received it, I couldn't believe how simple the setup was. It was so brain dead easy. Within 30 minutes, I had replaced my problematic, multiple WiFi networks with a single, consolidated WiFi network. It's been  Now, I don't even think about my WiFi.  It's been running for about 6 weeks and the complaints from the rest of the family have ceased and I've stopped wasting my time playing tech support to fix the network. It's like plumbing now. It just works.. ",

"THE ULTIMATE PIZZA MANUAL Fan","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"NOW THAT ALL THREE ARE WORKING, LOVE IT!  At first, only two of the three-pack worked. The third one wouldn't connect. It was VERY FRUSTRATING. The eero app also said the unit needed upgrading. Spent several hours trying to solve this. Finally, I thought of taking it off the network. Got a message saying that if I did that, it would RESET TO FACTORY DEFAULTS. AH HA!! That fixed it. It subsequently reconnected and we've been getting 60+mbps all over the house and outside as well. (A $255 Linksys WRT1900AC Dual Band Smart Wi-Fi Wireless AC Router (2.4 + 5GHz) *PLUS* a $111 Linksys AC1200 MAX Wi-Fi Range Extender (RE6500) with homemade house wiring. NOW GARBAGE. BOO HOO! But with all that Linksys stuff, we STILL had dead spots, weak/slow wifi, AND VERY COMPLEX LINKSYS-BROWSER-BASED CONFIGURATION. EERO magically eliminates all that hassle and provides extremely high-speed wifi !!) ",
Mrresurface,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Simply amazing.  Easy to set up.  I did need to hard wire my first two eeros to each other.  Going from the main eero downstairs to the others upstairs rendered a weak signal, but hard wiring it was worth it.  I'm getting over 200mb in my past deads spots, such as the master bed room and deck, which makes this purchase worth the money as it works and communicates with itself to keep working and it did not interfere with my TV downstairs I have hard wired to the xfinity modem.  I read of Issues with LUMA having issues with existing hardwired connecitons. ",

"Amazon Customer","April 3, 2017 ",5.0,"I really don't understand what other people are doing wrong in their setup.  I purchased the 3 unit system, since even though I had fast wifi with a Verizon router (their top of the line router as of 2016), with two separate modem spots at opposite ends of the house, I still had dead spots that made no sense to me whatsoever.  My office is above my kitchen, and my wifi would be dropped by every device there, not more than 20 ft from the router.  I understand that this is through the floor... But should at least have decent connectivity.  Furthermore, my xbox was less than 10 feet from my 2nd router, and it would only show 2 or 3 out of 4 bars.  I would also get tons of lag while playing the division.  And to top it off, my TV would drop its connection when streaming movies from my computer.    Needless to say, Verizon was not helpful.  They offered to sell an extender for $99, which didn't make much sense to me since again, the router was only 10 feet away.  So, I turned to eero.  From opening the box to surfing the net, it took roughly 20 minutes.  At first I was worried, since my 100/100 speed was showing up as 40/37.  But after maybe an hour (the instructions say it could take up to 24 hours to optimize) I was at full blast.  Please view the pic as a reference.    The last test was playing on the Xbox.  I hard wired the Xbox to one of my eeros since there were many complaints about signal swapping with them.  the gaming had no lag at all, and I did not notice any sort of drop in connectivity.  Played for about an hour.    This system is super fast, amazingly easy to set up, user friendly and has a decent app to go with it.  i highly recommend this to anyone with dead spot problems in their house. ",
"Tyler Nielsen","June 7, 2016 ",5.0,"This product, other than the price, couldn't be more perfect. Had a 3 year old Belkin router (i know, sad) and needed an upgrade after dealing with buffering from the Apple TVs and overloaded access point from the Canary, Wemos and other smart devices... Took 20 minutes to set up and get things running. Outside the minor glitch of having to update the software on the main hub prior to getting a solid connection on the second eero in the office, it was seamless.    Have nearly a 60% increase in speed, and buffering is non-existent in the apple TVs. Looking forward to loading them up with 30 devices with the inlaws in the coming weeks and seeing the throughput. Love the idea, and after all of my research, glad I chose this instead of the Linksys, Google, Luma or all the other ones.    Highly recommend and would love to see whats coming next. ",

"JJ &amp; AW","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"Sometimes a briefer review is more helpful and this one is just that. eero tech support is 5 star, I contacted them for pre-sale and then after purchase; no issues at all. Amazing experience and an amazing product. The after sale tech contact was just thanking eero for engineering such a fantastic product. If you can setup an iPhone you can do eero. Download an app, plugin, enjoy seamless wifi!  Evaluating all the current and new entities into the home mesh network space I easily picked the eero system over others. I do tech all day at work and when I'm home I want to use services and products that enhance my life as transparently as possible. All Mac, all iPhone and an all eero network...it like heaven. Simple and it works everytime I need it to. The eero 3-pack replaced 3 routers in my older home with 13&#34;thick brick walls. Now rather than 5 SSID's and passwords we have 1 continuous zone for the family and 1 super secure guest network. ",

I have the base unit in the basement, another on the main level in the kitchen, and the final in my bedroom up on the second level. The coverage and speeds are fantastic.

"C. Fries","November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I have tried everything to get a better wifi signal, strength and consistency of both in my house for years. I live in a single story that is a decent size, almost 3,000, so there's a lot of ground to cover (wifi wise). I also have a smart TV in the back yard, so it is actually even bigger ground to cover. At first I tried to improve my wifi changing ISP from AT&T to Time Warner's 300mbps download speed. That didn't improve the wifi-strength to the other side of the house from where the modem was located. Then I tried TP Links along with Netgear range extenders. They helped, but weren't consistent. Some days decent, some days terrible, but never exceptionally good performance, even on their best days. Didn't know what to do, then was recommended Eero. I was skeptical, as nothing had really worked in the past, but I figured I could return it if I was in no better shape. Well, no need for returning. First, the set up was idiot proof. Literally as simple as 1, 2, 3. As close to plug and play as you can get. Now, on to the important part - performance. I was blown away with how strong and how far the signal carried. I was able to stream Netflix on the family room TV and the backyard smart TV, which are located on the other side of the house to the modem, with no buffer, crystal clear picture, and immediate downloading. I was able to use multiple devices simultaneously throughout the house with no loss of strength, and I run a lot of equipment from security cameras, video door bell, multiple TVs, computers, iPads, laptop, iPhones, solar panel monitoring, etc.    This is hands down, the best product for the internet since the invention of the internet. Couldn't be more satisfied! From set up to performance, you will not be disappointed ",
A.C.,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought this set to use in Hong Kong where flats are tiny and have many concrete walls which normally block wifi signal. One thing I missed was that Eero does not support PPPoe while my ISP is using such setting, the only way to solve this issue is router on router.    I went straight to Apple Store to buy an Airport Extreme and an Airport Express (thanks to the return policy) to try. I plugged in the Airport Extreme and tried the wifi signal, hoping it can cover my tiny flat. In the living room the speed was 90mbs out of 100mbs, while in the study it dropped to 20mbs which is unacceptable.    Desperately, I used the router on router option for Eero and placed one in living room and another one in study room. I did the speed test again and WOW! 90mbs in both the living room and study room! It dropped to 70mbs in master bedroom and kitchen which is acceptable, but I can always add another Eero if needed in the future.    Satisfied with the result, I took away the Airport Extreme and tried the setting with Airport Express, same testing result. So Airport Extreme is going back to Apple. ",
Robert,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I was having network roaming issues, so I thought for sure with all the high ratings this product would be great. I found a series of issues which resulted in a return.    – While it did create a mesh network, each 'hop' cuts the download speed in half. If you pay for 150 Mb down, and you are at the end opposite side of the house, expect to get at most 1/2 your speed, possibly 1/4 or less.  – Intermittent speeds, even when standing directly in front of the main unit  – These units also got very hot  – My three year old Apple Airport Extreme (Gen 6 / A1521, current version) outperform eeros in all respects. In fact, after fiddling with placement and tech support calls and finally returning the eeros, I revisited my Extremes and named the four SSIDs the same name – it roams seamlessly now.  – It's odd that you need to provide both your cell phone and email address to set these units up  – I added a star, because out of the box, if you get this for grandma, they do seem to blanket a house with coverage, it's just slow.

"eero Support","July 21, 2016 ",4.0,"If you are, like we were, tired of spending $200 here and there on &#34;more powerful&#34; wireless networks, adaptors, extenders, etc...that take hours to set up (and are very confusing) only to continually have dead spots in your home, or weak signals, buffering, and drops...you will LOVE eero!  In less than 30 minutes, we had our 3 unit eero system up and running with the fastest speed and strongest signals we have ever had in our two story (2,500+ square feet) home.  No dead spots, buffering issues are gone, no more issues where the kids are complaining because the wifi dropped a signal.  Honestly, we don't really think about our wifi any longer - except for when I happen to see the cute little white square, which, by the way is another plus.  Our last wireless adaptor had so many antennas and continuously blinking lights, our living room was starting to look like the Nassau space center!  The only con is the price - which is why we resisted buying it for a while.  But once you get over that, welcome to your new no-wifi-issue home! ",
LizaG68,"August 28, 2016 ",2.0,"I replaced my 2 year old Apple Time Capsule with eero.  I improved my signal strength by 70% in the two other locations that I needed to get a solid Wi-Fi signal.  I used the WiFi signal app from the Mac app store to measure the improvement.  I now have a solid signal everywhere in the house.  I was also able to turn off Wi-Fi on the Time Capsule and now just use it as a Time Machine.    eero is super simple to setup.  Just follow along with the app that you need to download to your phone and it walks you through each step.  I had 3 devices installed and connected in less that 15 minutes.  A trick you may want to try if this eero is replacing an existing router. Name the eero network with exactly the name as your old network and use your old password.  That way any device connecting to your network does not need to be reconfigured.  I have 3 Wemo devices, 2 iPads, 2 iPhones, Alexa, Dot, 2 Apple TVs, 1 Wireless Laser printer and two TiVo units and none of them needed any configuration changes.  Saved a lot of time and hassle.    Overall I am really happy with erro! ",
"T. Campbell","October 7, 2016 ",5.0,"After suffering with poor coverage, about 5 months ago I invested in a range extender for my wifi network.  The result was intermittent improvement.  After reading about eero I decided to give it a try.  I think I could have gotten by with 2 but the 3 pack seemed to be the better buy if 2 didn't work.  Amazon delivered in a day and, as advertised set up was virtually automatic.  The 3 eero's automatically found each other once telling them a network name and pw.  It found all 12 of our networked devices and seamlessly set them up.  Up and going in under 10 minutes.  And, no more signal dropouts; even from the far end of the house.  Not inexpensive but worth it in stable results. ",
Graywalker,"July 14, 2016 ",5.0,"Amazing product - so easy to set up and understand.

Strong enough bandwidth for our family members staying over to watch Netflix and/or hold video conferences from their cottage.

There hasn't been a single connectivity issue, and it was almost a daily occurrence before.

"eero support","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I have waited a couple of months before posting this review. My situation is a 2 story house with a staircase in the middle.

I had tried a range extender with not much luck as although I was in a deadspot with my old router, it would not transition to the extender or when it did I had already lost connection on what I was doing as I walked around. Getting fed up with this, I decided to try the 3 Eero set as it was on sale. My pack of 3 included one lemon that Eero replaced quickly, and their support team was very helpful. I should note that I have 2 of the 3 hard wired in. I am happy to say that since getting them set up, I haven't had a single issue of dead spots.

"Wes M","July 28, 2016 ",5.0,"The configuration of our house makes a consistent WiFi signal difficult.  The modem has to be upstairs, which makes the reception in the downstairs bedrooms difficult to impossible.  I purchased a signal extender, which worked for a while, but never well or consistently.  When I read about eero, I was very interested.  True to the review, it was VERY easy to set up, with one exception.  It took me a while to figure out the best way to get my Sonos working again.  My wife is far more into Sonos than she is exceptional WiFi coverage, so she quickly declared it a bust.  However, with a little bit of research, I very quickly solved that problem and we now have spotless and fast WiFi in areas where we had no WiFi before. I also have younger kids who love to log back in when it's lights out...eero allows me to schedule their WiFi access, so I can shut them down at night.

Of note, my family room reading (I do streaming tv) went from 16.8mps to 24.94mps.  My daughter's bedroom (had the slowest speed in the house) went from a download speed of 0.86mps to 15.65mps!  Admittedly, I did have one hiccup and that's that I have fiber optic so instead of a modum, I have a switch so that caused an initial failure of the install routine. I called the support number and the lady on the other end troubleshot the install (took two more attempts before the nature of the problem was found. The solution was to leave my ASUS router in place as a bridge and connect the eero to it. Not the most elegant solution but I didn't have another use for the ASUS anyway. ",

I had a traditional network set up using Apple routers and Netgear extenders and eero was a tremendous upgrade.    First of all the set up was very simple using the app.  The app is easy to use and intuitive.  Setting up several units took less than 20 minutes.  When choosing eero, this was one of the factors that influenced my decision over Netgear's product in which the app appeared dated (at least at the time I'm writing this).    Most importantly though is that eero just works.  I struggled with random dead spots all over my home (despite having repeaters literally 15 ft from the devices) and I am no longer having this issue.

All my devices have stable connections - the eero app makes administration super simple.

My home has ethernet that runs through the walls so two eeros had a physical connection through an ethernet cable while one eero had to do connect wirelessly.    Having a physical connection to the eero greatly enhances download and upload speeds around the home. Two eeros were placed upstairs and then one eero downstairs. It is slightly true that more or less, the eeros have to be &#34;within sight&#34; of each other for best connectivity to the other eeros in the system. Otherwise you will be prompted saying the connectivity strength is not as strong as it could be.

It was easy to set up the eero and then join my AirPort Express / AirPlay devices to the new network. I also have a switch counted to the primary office eero, and have had no issues connecting several devices (printer, network drives, iMac. Tablo) via ethernet. I did have one issue with an eero software upgrade, but that was resolved easily by eero support. Now, my speed test shows 148 mbps download and 13 mbps upload speeds. Fantastic! ",
doc,"June 5, 2016 ",5.0,"The eero system is fantastic. The mesh network helping break the chains of multiple SSIDs is a dream come true. Performance is top tier. I have tested this sytem by streaming Netflix 4k, Facebooking on an ipad, and streaming Youtube on two iphones all simultaneously on a 100mbps downstream internet connection and there wasnt a single hiccup or rebuffering. My only issues are that there a some compatibility issues with some of my wifi devices such as my Xbox 360SE and Ring Pro doorbell. It also has compatibility issues with one the most popular Arris owner owned cable modems. The eero app could use a few more features and the system could use a few more advance user features/tools. Otherwise i am mostly happy with it. Highly recommended ",
"Kelly Brownsberger","January 16, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought this to simplify and hopefully improve my home wifi.  I had a home brew of WAP's with the Sam SSID spread around the house and it just never worked all that well and was a constantly pain trying to find channels and frequencies that didn't have issues and the connecting devices never seemed convinced of my attempt at making a true mesh.  I wanted experts to produce a real mesh like I see in commercial environments like hotels - but in my house.  The eero seemed expensive but if it was going to give me what I want it was with it.    I ripped out my home brew and put the eero three pack behind on zyxel firewall and I've been very impressed by it.  Even my 4 and 6 year old kids immediately remarked about the improvement.  I did t tell them I changed anything but they remarked how much better YouTube for Kids was working in their rooms :)    It's been almost 2 months and it's been working flawlessly.  I'm a very happy customer. ",
LB,"October 5, 2016 ",4.0,"We are IT pros and always get latest best wireless tech. So we thought. Only the Eero has delivered high speeds we have never seen before on wired or wireless. Wireless speeds now match the speeds of wired Ethernet AND we are seeing speeds faster in our recorded history! We have 3 units and every inch of our house is covered same high speeds. We were using 3 Linksys routers before - no comparison as the system always works! We should apologize to Comcast thinking it was their fault when internet seemed to go down all the time. IT people? Embarrassing. Notice others now following their lead. Love love love Eero. ",
curtis,"September 21, 2016 ",5.0,"I have had a lot of routers over the years. Most of them I would replace within a year because I got sick of rebooting them. I finally had a stable one with the Apple routers. However mine was the express and is meant to handle 5 connections. Apple is stopping production on their routers so what was I to do? Read reviews and hit twitter. I found Eero currently I live in a 2 bedroom apartment so just 1 Eero will do for now. It is great to know that when I upgrade I can add to the system. It has worked very well, I love the feature that it will restart the device if it notices bad connection. If you are looking for a new WiFi system you should do an Eero system. Best money I have spent. ",
Mrresurface,"January 23, 2017 ",5.0,"Simply amazing.  Easy to set up.  I did need to hard wire my first two eeros to each other.  Going from the main eero downstairs to the others upstairs rendered a weak signal, but hard wiring it was worth it.  I'm getting over 200mb in my past deads spots, such as the master bed room and deck, which makes this purchase worth the money as it works and communicates with itself to keep working and it did not interfere with my TV downstairs I have hard wired to the xfinity modem.  I read of Issues with LUMA having issues with existing hardwired connecitons. ",

We live in a 100 year-old 4-story brick house and the Wifi + extender was just not getting the job done.  I probably could add one more extender as the base is on the top floor, but it is working brilliantly. The signal strength stays very consistent and we have had minimal interruptions since installation.    I will say that once there is an interruption with one of the units, you have to remove it from the network and then add it back in - at least that is the only way I could reset the unit. We have regularly 12-14 different devices connected with a maximum DSL speed of 11-12mbps. Highly recommend the eero system. ",

I have every expectation that once my attic remodel is finished that adding other units will extend this excellent signal there as well.  This is one product that really delivers! ",
"Aaron Cohen","April 24, 2016 ",4.0,"This is a great product and I highly recommend it to people who want control of their own wifi.  It was super simple to set up and took me an hour to get all three of my devices working and fairly well optimized. I did play with placement.  I had trouble bridging my router or even knowing that I had to do that, but a great customer service call with Matt walked me through it and we did speedtests before and after.  Company is going to do very well.    One issue:  I live in a 4 floor 6000 square foot house and it's not clear to me that 3 Eeros will be enough.  However, I've only spent 500 bucks so far and every network optimization quote I got was minimum 2k in service and new hardware (the fallacy of commercial grade routers).  This is a DIY product for people who aren't amazing with network technologies. ",
JF,"May 7, 2016 ",5.0,"Kudos to the design team -- this is one of those few products that executes brilliantly, and yet is invisible behind the scenes (as a router should be).  With a little experimentation in terms of locating the units, we were easily able to get rid of all our dead zones and now enjoy fast wifi throughout the house -- and into the backyard.  Previously had a Apple extreme router with another Apple router setup as an extender -- this was frustrating at best, and never seemed to work. ",
"Sebastian Sylvan","October 12, 2016 ",5.0,"This really is a great little product. I can now get 400+ Mbit/s all over my home, whereas before I'd be lucky to break 100.   Pros:  * Ethernet jack on every device. Unlike some of the competitors, this means  you can choose to hard wire some of the eeros for even better speeds (I used a MoCA bridge for this, which runs Ethernet over the existing cable connections in my house). Some of the competitors only have an Ethernet jack on a &#34;main&#34; device.  * Simple setup.  * Reliable network that Just Works. My phone automatically connects to the best network to maximize speed.  * Can be used in &#34;bridge&#34; mode where the Eero's just acts as access points to my existing router.     There are  a few downsides:  * Need to make an account to set up the Eero in the app.  * Needs an app at all. I have an iPhone right now, but I've previously used windows phone and might go back to it in the future and the fact that you need either an Android or iOS phone to do the setup is a bit worrying. I'd prefer if the &#34;app&#34; was just a web page served by the devices, so it could be accessed on any device, including a laptop.  * No full IPv6 support. Not super critical right now I suppose, but a bit risky that it may not support this for the future (no problem if you use the Eero's in bridge mode though - as long as your existing router handles IPv6). This is the one and only reason I kept my existing router rather than just use Eero's for everything.    For me personally it would be a 5 star review if the IPv6 thing gets addressed in a future update because it would mean I could just get rid of my traditional router altogether. The other cons are an annoyance but not enough to dock a star.

"Charles Morrison","December 6, 2016 ",5.0,"Impressive performance, very easy to set up. Better yet, once I set it up, it's been problem-free. The only router I've ever owned where I didn't have to reboot it on a semi-regular basis. Even tech stuff like ip reservations and port-forwarding has been a breeze.  No dead spots anywhere in my 4000 sq ft home, where the whole basement was hit or miss with my previous AirPort Extreme. So far, two thumbs way up. ",

Wifi extender I was using was lame.  Before ordering, I called Eero customer support with a question.  Wow!  Human being in NorAm spoke to me, answered my question, and followed up with a relevant email.  I ordered Eero three piece set.  Installed two units at my home in a breeze.  I almost did not believe how easy it was.  Performance improvement is fabulous!  Installed the third unit in my office - while I was on a conference call.  Less than zero hassle.  Highly recommended!

"L. Herman","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"Sometimes a start up product comes along that is actually better than anticipated or advertised, and from my experience the eero is certainly one of those few.

"Brian Doherty","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I'm a techie, and am used to having to tinker with stuff to get it working just right. With the eeros, everything just worked.

You can hang out on the eero Reddit forums to see technical staff answer all sorts of questions from users, showing the world what their secret sauce is to their technology. They seem really dedicated to their customers.    I replaced 2 Apple Time Capsules with a 3 pack. I get my FIOS 100/100 plan almost everywhere I go in the house (and atleast 50/50 in the spots furthest from an eero node).

Wish I could get real internet up here in the woods, but in the meantime, eero = fail... ",
"eero Support","November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Ok, I've had these in place for a few months now. Long enough to have an opinion.    First of all, they are very &#34;Appleish&#34; in the design and appearance. Even the packaging. It is quite nice. Assuming you have an iphone or ipad to run the app on, the setup is very simple and nearly foolproof. To be fair, I didn't try the Android app but based on other reviews, it appears that the ios app is more refined. They have simplified the product setup (perhaps too much?) and made it a breeze for anyone, even without technical knowledge, to get these up and running quickly and painlessly.    Once the 3 APs are up and connected to each other, &#34;it just works&#34;. Bravo! I can attest that these absolutely fixed WiFi dead spots and weak signals throughout my house. I replaced an Asus 802.11ac router/AP with these and the difference has been fantastic. Yes, yes... I know, some of you are screaming about &#34;if you know how to configure.. blah blah blah&#34;. I know how to configure it - I've got many many years and all the silly certificates and whatnot. That isn't the issue.    The app has a really nice indicator with status and how many devices are connected. One very nice addition is the speed test. You &#34;pull down&#34; the screen and it runs a speed test and displays the results right in the app. Nice touch. I also like that I can create and share a guest network in seconds with the app. Very nice. The lack of physical ports on the devices isn't that big a deal. A cheap switch plugged into one of those solves that problem forever.    Now for the not so great...    Because this is simplified for anyone to get it up and running and even manage it, it lacks some advanced features or tweaks. I have some wireless devices that are a little bit finicky. A thermostat for example works like a champ on 2.4 GHz but has erratic connectivity on 5. Don't know why, it just does. The app would benefit from an &#34;expert mode&#34; or something like that where I could define those things. I also would like to have the option to define the channel being used. If that is some kind of magical &#34;we pick the best one for you&#34; type of thing, I'd like the option to see that data. Finally, lets talk about the price shall we? This is a pretty expensive product. You could get the same &#34;mesh&#34; functionality from Ubiquiti's UniFi or use some power-line devices if you just need to connect a couple of devices away from your modem. WiFi range extenders are a cheaper option although they aren't nearly as slick or reliable.    Then we have this awful moment;  The 2 devices that aren't wired directly into my modem would randomly disconnect and show a red status light. They'd come back after 30-60 seconds but this constant up/down cycle went on for days. Instead of fussing with it, I fired up the app, navigated through the help section and emailed support with the information requested. Then --- crickets. No acknowledgement, no reply, no help. searching some internet forums, I'm not the only one to have this issue. I basically had to remove everything and go through the setup routine all over again while moving the 2 wireless APs around a little bit to get  a better signal. Not exactly sure why it ran fine for so long then suddenly became unstable, but it did.    I thought the lack of any response from support may have just been an oversight so I followed up the original ticket with a second request. Nothing again. Unfortunately, it appears that email support is non-existent. I didn't call the phone number but, I don't think I should have to. These are not cheap by any measure. Maybe the time, money, and effort put into the pretty packaging would have been better spent ensuring that customer support was top notch. I'd rather the product came in a brown paper bag and get stellar customer support than pretty packaging but nobody to answer my email.    Overall, if you care about aesthetics and you want to cover a large area with seamless WiFi, this is a great product. If you are more price sensitive, take a look at some of the alternatives. And finally, if you are not comfortable with suspect customer service, you may want to wait while, what I assume are growing pains, are resolved before you purchase. ",

Can't shoot it up the stairs as stairs have a landing and a 180 degree bend.

So we decided to try Eero.  Excellent decision.    Install was a breeze, though I realized our three locations didn't work perfectly at first. The second Eero I attempted to install in the mid-level wouldn't connect.  Proceeding to the third box, in the top level just above our basement Eero, it connected fine.  Then I attempted the second box again and no problems.    Basically, you have to be prepared to let Eero build your network over again.    But now we have full bandwidth everywhere in our house. We went from 50/50 in the basement and 12ish elsewhere to 58/52 everywhere. Just a couple weeks later and now our only problem is our ISP.

"P. Gordon","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I decided to purchase this system after reading the great reviews and needing a way to get decent wifi out to my back porch and garage. I liked my trusty old Apple AirPort base station but even using an additional Airport Express as an extender wasn't performing well. My devices often wouldn't switch over to the closer device, and speeds were pretty poor. I eventually quit using the Express and tossed it into my spare gadget box. I set the eero system up in just a few minutes, and everything just works, perfect, everywhere in the house and most of my yard. Far better than my best effort before. It's not cheap but unless you actually enjoy configuring wifi networks it's well worth the price. ",

"Gerald Barber","July 7, 2016 ",5.0,"The Good: The Eero is a great wifi extender. I live in a split ranch house which has 3 levels and is approximately 100 feet from end to end on the main level. It's also almost 60 years old and built with material much more impervious to wifi signals than modern construction. I've tried numerous wifi routers and range extenders in an attempt to provide coverage throughout my house and, until Eero, they all failed miserably with large dead zones in various regions of the house that couldn't be eliminated no matter what I tried. Eero is the first system that I found that is able to provide not only wifi coverage, but a strong signal, throughout every room in my house. Why then am I only giving it 1 star?    The Bad: Unfortunately, both Eero software and documentation are incredibly buggy. Moreover, even when a more recent version of the software is released, the customer cannot initiate or force their devices to update and instead must wait for the update to be pushed out to their units by the Eero rolling system. In fact, I've been unable to get the update to the latest released version of the software even after contacting technical support to report an issue that I was having. This brings me to the the other major reason for my 1 star rating, customer and/or technical support, or more correctly the near absence of this support. In a little over a week, I've contacted Eero 3 times. The first time, I received a boilerplate response from their website that was totally unresponsive to the issue I raised. Not only did the text on the Eero website not contain the appropriate information that I required to install/setup the Eero system on my network but also my reply to Eero indicating that their boilerplate response didn't address the question that I specifically asked was completely ignored with no further answer or information provided. It was only through trial and error that I was able to figure out the steps that I needed to take to setup the Eero system. After completing the initial setup, I needed to open some ports on the Eero for forwarding of specific Internet communication to other devices running on my system. I soon discovered that this also didn't work as described. I again contacted Eero support, only to be told that their system indicated that the ports I was attempting to forward were indeed open. Still I could not get external communication to work. Ultimately, I discovered that, due to a bug in their software, even if your device only requires/uses TCP communication, you have to open both the TCP and UDP protocols on the port before Eero with correctly forward the communication to the appropriate device. I recontacted Eero support and was told that they're &#34;aware of this issue.&#34; Finally, I noticed that, concurrent with replace my router with Eero, my network developed terrible latency issues in communication between local devices. Devices that had near instantaneous response with the old router were now taking 2 to 6 seconds to respond and this delay was causing both software and hardware to fail. I again contacted technical support. It took 2 days to get a response, which was to escalate the issue. It took another 2 days before I heard for the escalation agent and this response just asked for more specifics on my system, which I immediately sent. Now 6 days after I originally reported the problem and 4 days after it was supposedly escalated, I'm still waiting on a response that would actually help me resolve the problem.    In summary, if it happens to work with your network out of the box, Eero is an outstanding wifi system. However, you're on your own if it doesn't. The document is inadequate, the software is buggy, and technical support is virtually non-existent. As a result, I cannot recommend this system for non-IT professionals.    Edit: 02/08/2017 - Eero now allows the user to initiate a manual update instead of waiting for the update to be rolled out to the device. ",
"eero Support","December 4, 2016 ",5.0,"&nbsp;I hate to have to write this review as I really wanted these Eero's to work. However, as it turns out, my old apple airports never had the issues I experienced until I switched over to Eero. Once I switched back to the old airports, all the following issues went away.    Frequent Drops  As seen in the attached video, you'll notice that the throughput goes up and down every 30-45 seconds, which is significant enough that it causes streaming music to pause frequently. Of course streaming video was a non-starter. I spent over a month trying to debug this with Eero support with no luck. Note that this issue happens no matter the distance to the access point.    Connectivity  Most of my devices connect fine. However, I have a couple of devices that seem to have connectivity problems on a regular bases. One of my MacBook Pro's required me to hard code an IP in order to maintain a connection. Same issue was found with an iPad as well. Note that this issue happens no matter the distance to the access point.    Company  It's also important to note that I tried to work with the company to resolve these issues for a couple of months. I started the process with Eero Support within the first month, creating videos and providing long detailed explanations regarding the behaviors. They logged into my devices remotely to monitor the behavior and also sent me a custom firmware.  However, now that it seems like they won't be able to fix the issues, I asked for a refund. However, eero refused because they said it was over a month since I purchased the product. I explained that this hardly seemed fair given I, in good faith, worked with their support organization to resolve their product issues, conversations which started BEFORE the month mark. I would recommend folks thinking about purchasing an eero make sure you quickly confirm the performance of the product and return the product right away if any issues are all are found instead of working with Support given this policy.

"eero support","March 15, 2017 ",1.0,"Perfect solution to cover a large two-story house.  We have heavy users (streaming video, game systems, multiple phones, tablets, laptops, DVRs, etc.) at every corner of the house and the three pack covers everything very nicely.  It did take 24 hours and a firmware update to get to full speed, but it took care of itself.  Running the microwave used to make every wifi device pause, but not anymore!    A setup tip:  The quality of the system is sensitive to the placement of each unit.  If a unit is not getting a good signal, try moving it 6 inches in any direction. One unit had a very poor connection when placed behind a speaker, but moving to the side on the speaker allowed a full strength signal and full speed.

Gone are the days of endless configurations and tweaks to get things right during setup. Also gone are the days of turning off my wifi in certain areas of the house or in the backyard because the signal is weak and it's better to just hop on a cell network.    You open the box and the equipment is laid out in steps - install this piece first and then the second and so forth. The app is clean and simple and will walk you through the entire process.    Coverage in our house has improved greatly since installing eero units on each floor. Now all I need to do it double down and purchase a few more; that's the only downside, cost. I believe you get what you pay for and you will pay for great home network coverage. ",
WWWWoodchuck,"July 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I work in IT and live in a 2500 sqft 2 story home.  I have always had trouble with wireless.  I've tried everything.  Repeaters, routers converted into gateways, different routers, seriously, all kinds of tests, configurations, products and... this solved my problem.  Now I have fast wireless in the house and outside.  I used to do test in my office as an acid test and I always got an unstable 5Mbps or less.  Now I get 85 to 100 Mbps in the same location.  The same location I have used for testing for years.  Never has anything ever come close.  And I can now go all over the house and I get really nice, fast connections.  This is a great product. ",
BrianInChicago,"August 22, 2016 ",5.0,"It. Just. Works.    In a big house with a lot of metal in the walls, I've suffered through many models of Wi-Fi routers, trying to get coverage in this or that remote wins and usually failing, even with repeaters (that rarely worked). So, the Eero system seemed very promising and IT WORKS. I do occasionally have issues where a device will &#34;stick&#34; with a farther-away Eero and refuse to switch to the closer one but this event is unusual, not the norm. I suspect it has more to do with the device's firmware and no Eero. Setup was easy. IT JUST WORKS. ",

curtis,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I have had a lot of routers over the years. Most of them I would replace within a year because I got sick of rebooting them. I finally had a stable one with the Apple routers. However mine was the express and is meant to handle 5 connections. Apple is stopping production on their routers so what was I to do? Read reviews and hit twitter. I found Eero currently I live in a 2 bedroom apartment so just 1 Eero will do for now. It is great to know that when I upgrade I can add to the system. It has worked very well, I love the feature that it will restart the device if it notices bad connection. If you are looking for a new WiFi system you should do an Eero system. Best money I have spent. ",
Antonio,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I love Eero it really fixed my WiFi connectivity problems at my house. Before Eero I tried several combinations of Router and Replicators, different locations and nothing really fixed the spotty signals I had in some parts of the house.    Eero is pretty straightforward to use, the app is really great, it helps you visualize the connections and manage your devices with ease.    I also chose Eero because I did not want Google managing the internet of my home (Google knows too much about me already :-), parsing everything that my family is doing. I really like that Eero has no ties to Advertising companies and businesses. ",
"jennifer lucas","January 3, 2017 ",5.0,"Holy Crap that was easy!!! I get home from a very long commute and I'm kinda tech savvy - but I just don't have it in me after a long day. I have time to write this bc the eero took like 15 minutes to set up (downloaded app, had to get a rag to dust off my modem, etc). so far so good the real test is when I watch the Americans tomorrow and if we buffer.. or not. (its a little s'pensive otherwise 5 stars). ",
"Greg Cooper","December 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I had huge doubts when I began to set these up because the second one I tried to setup was struggling to connect to the first. I did a little reading and they suggest keeping them within line-of-sight of one another. This isn't really possible in my apartment unless I owned maybe 8 or 9 of them and then it would just be an apartment covered in eeros and plugs, not something I want. Fortunately, I was able to position it just outside of line-of-sight and was able to get them to connect. The following morning, however, they had disconnected from one another again which got me insanely worried but they did reconnect without me doing anything other than restarting the first one.    However, since that initial hiccup, it has been unbelievably good. I was previously running a Netgear Nighthawk C7000 and an R7000 (separately across months) and both failed miserably. Neither of these routers are particularly cheap either which made it all the more annoying. My best speed with the R7000, which was the router I was using before switching to eeros, was maxing out at about 190 Mbps in the room where it was located. The speed instantly rocketed up to 290 Mbps which is faster than I'm actually paying for, no one tell Comcast.    I purposefully get a WiFi spot check in various rooms before making the switch so I could get an accurate read out on whether or not the eeros actually improved my network reliability or speed. Here's some of the changes averaged out across 3 tests lasting 10 seconds each (rooms with an eero in them have been marked as such):    Living room (eero): 190 Mbps to 290 Mbps  Kitchen: 110 Mbps to 200 Mbps  Bathroom: 75 Mbps to 145 Mbps  Master bedroom (eero): 15 Mbps to 120 Mbps (the original speed was actually a major reason I looked into eeros)  Second bedroom: 45 Mbps to 150 Mbps    (The remaining eero is located in my hallway, which I never tested before hand)    On top of the speed improvements, it also allowed me to wire in certain devices which have rather poor connections regardless of WiFi speed such as a PS4, Roku, and Apple TV. A major improvement was the reliability of my Philips Hue box. Since I could now put it in a more reasonable location than my living room (which had no bulbs in it), I'm now able to use my Hue bulbs very consistently without bulbs disconnecting from the box.    I've been raving about these to friends and family like crazy and I plan to purchase another three to really create a ridiculous home network with an eero in my second bedroom, kitchen, and maybe at the opposite end of my hallway (I have an T shaped hallway). You should buy! ",

Lorac,"April 11, 2016 ",5.0,"The eero has changed everything in our household.  We have a 5,000 square foot home with 3 floors to cover.  The house is long and the cable modem and old router were in the office at the furthest end of the house.  We used high-quality updated routers with after-market antennas yet we still could not keep a decent enough signal at the opposite end of the main floor to run a webcam in the dining room (furthest point from router in office).  In addition we couldn't get adequate signal upstairs or in the basement.  With 10 ft. ceilings it made the distance to upstairs even further.  In the basement only one room directly under the router could get a decent signal.  eero has changed everything for us with respect to multiple dead zones and signal strength.  We used a 3-pack of EERO on the main floor only.  One where the old router was located at one end of the house, another in near the middle of the main floor and the third at the other end (dining room) of the main floor.  The signal strength is so good now we can use any wireless device, including phones, cameras, Hue lights and computers consistently on the main floor.  But.... what we didn't necessarily expect is that with these 3 units spread across the main floor the signal strength is good enough to cover the entire second floor as well as the entire basement.  I checked all areas using the WiFi Analyzer app on my android phone.  We even have signal strength in the garage to install a wifi security camera there as well.  Now we can use an iPad in the basement living room.  We can use any device in the bedrooms upstairs.  This product is extremely easy to set-up.  All you do is plug the first one in and do what your phone app tells you to do to set up the other two units.  It helps you place them appropriately.  We aren't using all features yet, but we plan to give priority to our OOMA voip telephone (also connected via wifi) so voice traffic gets priority over other traffic.  The units look nice on top of furniture or a desk.  I highly recommend an eero 3-pack for large homes! ",
doc,"April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"The eero system is fantastic. The mesh network helping break the chains of multiple SSIDs is a dream come true. Performance is top tier. I have tested this sytem by streaming Netflix 4k, Facebooking on an ipad, and streaming Youtube on two iphones all simultaneously on a 100mbps downstream internet connection and there wasnt a single hiccup or rebuffering. My only issues are that there a some compatibility issues with some of my wifi devices such as my Xbox 360SE and Ring Pro doorbell. It also has compatibility issues with one the most popular Arris owner owned cable modems. The eero app could use a few more features and the system could use a few more advance user features/tools. Otherwise i am mostly happy with it. Highly recommended ",
SlyMosquito,"July 18, 2016 ",5.0,"We've been dealing with spotty internet for years, and we often stream movies and TV shows in our basement on our smart TV, as well as on our computer. Since our router is upstairs, it would often disconnect and not want to even load Netflix, or any other site for that matter. Once I heard about Eero, I knew we had to try it, and boy was it a good choice. We haven't even had it a week, and I can already tell a big difference in connectivity. There hasn't been a single connectivity issue, and it was almost a daily occurrence before. The app is very easy to use to install and edit stuff otherwise, especially for people who don't know a whole lot in this field. I have recommended it to other people, and I would definitely recommend it to all of you who read this. It is definitely worth the money. ",
Tavo,"October 5, 2016 ",4.0,"First I'm in the IT business.  And as a Tech savy person I can say that eero does not come with many configuration options.  That's why I used to have a bunch other routers that support many other options.  But did I need them at home?  Turn out that I don't.  And supporting all of them was a day to day.  Ending on mutiple trips back home or calls from my sons and wife to get back online.  And explain then what to do was not simple.  The old turn off and back on became not just a funny request.    So, I got eero, and it took me 5 minutes to install it.  I was able to use my CAT5E backbone that I already had at home.  Results?  100% WIFI coverage and I have a concrete home with lots of steel and concrete walls.  eero was able to provide full coverage in all floors.  Even the basement.    Now I know who's at home, who is using it.  Whats speed I'm getting directly from the cable modem router, carrier test was only valid directly from the modem. I can do that remotely now and still have a test directly from the modem.  I can pause my kids internet access.    I am extremely happy that I gave up a bunch of things that I could use from traditional routers that I don't need and get an eero to work for me, so I can concentrate in what really matters. ",

We tried routers at both ends of our large, one level house to no avail. Our house had been pre-wired for Dial Up in the nineties, which we found out to be obsolete and an expert told us about the mesh system and we installed a new direct line to the Frontier modem and from there after bridging the router via an gigabit switch to the new eero system.  We are very satisfied with the results as we are using lots of computers and TVs throughout the house. Since the system has been installed there was no need for re setting the modem/router anymore. We are thinking to get a fourth eero to better cover the guest area at the far end of the house. ",

"Michael Bierman","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"My review of Eero wifi    For context, I was replacing three Apple AirPort Express units connected via ethernet with the Eeros.    Pros  ⦾ Elegant packaging ala Nest—close to Apple but not quite. Portrays a quality product.  ⦾ Easy to set up.  ⦾ Easy to add additional units.  ⦾ Nice that RJ45 ports are interchangeable. Plugin which ever one you want.  ⦾ Excellent Speed. At times I get &#62;220Mbs over wifi! Much better than the Apple AirPorts which only supported older wifi standards. I'm finally getting the full service that Comcast brings to my door.  ⦾ Love the way ports are listed under the mapped device. Makes a ton of sense.  ⦾ Remote admin—excellent feature.  ⦾ Build in speed test— another excellent feature. Nice because it tests from the perspective of the router out--not my device.  ⦾ Super Helpful support!    Places to improve  ⦾ Port mapping: Multiple ports in one line and it doesn't seem you can map a range of ports. Apple’s AirPort interface is better.  ⦾ Once made, you can't edit an IP reservation!!! One has to delete and recreate the reservation if the MAC address is wrong or you decide to change the IP address. If you have done any port forwarding, this is needlessly painful.  ⦾ Port reservations should automatically default to the same port. You seem to have to set both yourself.  ⦾ Mac addresses have to be entered in &#34;nn:nn:nn:nn:nn&#34; format and IPs have to be entered in &#34;xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx&#34;. Geez, make it easy on users!  ⦾ How long does a DHCP reservation last? Who knows? you can’t see and you can’t change it.  ⦾ Copy/Paste for things like your IP address, Mac Address, etc.  ⦾ Add option to turn off Internet PING.  ⦾ No support for hairpin NATing.  ⦾ No IPV6 support.  ⦾ Hardware seems to run a little hot. Not sure if that is a worry or not.  ⦾ It might be nice if you could open a port without reserving an IP address (based on MAC address) but I would consider this a minor convenience for when you don't care what the IP is, just that a port is open.    Updates  ⦾ No IP spoofing protection. It isn't possible to block IPs so external attacks claiming to be from inside the network are let in. This is a significant vector for attack. My Synology offers the option to automatically block logins beyond a certain number of failed attempts. This would be a great addition here as well but there are other possible solutions.  ⦾ I started to see some attacks that used IP spoofing to try to login to some security cameras. The router should reject packets originating from outside your local network that claim to originate from within.  ⦾ After a month or so using the product, I can say the connect is reliable and trouble free.    I assume that a lot of the issues above will be resolved as they are just changes in the mobile admin app and can be rolled out easily to all Eero users over time. ",
FLMartin,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Not great for our business, had to return. After successfully setting Eeros at our home, i decided to try for our 40 person business that solely does internet surfing (no video). Our business bandwith usages are less per month than a home with multiple kids that play online games and stream video. We used the eero in its recommended configuration where it was the main router not just a Access Point and while it worked with light traffic it failed when everyone connected, i was told by Eero support that each node can support up to 100 clients so we were far below that. Each eero had a hardwire ethernet connection to it to provide the best quality speed to them as their source, the main eero unit box just kept going online and offline and within an hour had to put our old Netgear R7300 back online and we were fine for the remainder of the day. We ended up using instead the Netgear Nighthawk X8 and all staff is happy and speeds from the one unit were similar as with 6 of the eeros, that was NOT the case with our old R7300 so from this test and particular use we will be keeping a single box vs 6 boxes. I find it very confusing that some of the reviews here on amazon state that tech support tells them that a user can have TOO MANY eeros in a space, Eero needs to work that out, we had our 6 spaced 30 to 40 feet apart and each was connected using their app. They are going to get a lot of returns until they tighten up that supposed problem with some firmware or hardware modifications. IT guy for thousands. ",
"eero support","April 16, 2016 ",4.0,"Theses are GREAT!!! I received them fast from Amazon and I got them on sale. Setup was a breeze and I was up and running in less then 5 minutes with the first eero. The remaining 2 were strategically placed in my house for the best coverage in less than 10 minutes. These offer better more reliable coverage inside and outside of my house than I've ever gotten with any other combination of router with range extenders. These are easy to set up with the instructions and there has not been a single dropped signal like i would get with my router. I haven't had to unplug or restart anything. I have an Iphone and the app you need to set the eero up is easy to use and intuitive. It also has a speed test in the app so you can see what you current upload and download speeds are. I haven't tested this against anything so I can't speak to it's accuracy. I use a switch in my office to connect my computers and peripherals to the network. People complain about the cost and I agree they are pricey but after you spend money on a good router and research the numerous other options for extending coverage you could get to the same cost very easy. You don't have the multitude of options you get with a router for setting up your network but I feel most of those are overkill for the average user. These are easy to use,work well, offer good reliable coverage for a wireless network and that's what most people are asking for. ",
Chris,"July 28, 2016 ",4.0,"My network has never been faster or more reliable.  Easy to set up and has worked flawlessly.  The app has shown me all devices accessing the network.  In short has made wireless in my house wonderful.  No dead zones and fast downloads.  I highly recommend Eero. ",
"S. Spencer","August 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I've had these for about a month and the jury is still out.  For my laptops and small devices, including some NEST thermostats, the eero (3 devices) works as advertised, in that I've seamlessly extended my wireless network throughout my spread-out home and well into my backyard.  I initially had some issues with my AT&T microcell and this left me guessing -- was it because of the eero (which does not explicitly support QoS for VoIP or streaming) or something else?  The eero interface (which is only available as an ios or android application) provides little to nothing by way of insight into the internals of the network.  To that end, I experimented and ended up moving the eero to bridge mode and turning my Airport Express into a DHCP server and connecting it all via network switch -- and this did not improve the performance of the microcell.  Only moving the microcell as far from the eero as possible led to improvements in microcell performance.  The other anomaly involves my Roku 3 and streaming video.  Although speed tests routinely come up at about 33 Mbps, streaming a TV show or movie usually involves one or more (as in, every ten minutes) interruption to the video stream with a diagnostic of &#34;network error&#34; and little else.  Unfortunately, there are no tools available to provide me with insight into exactly what's going on.  However, I am currently working with eero technical support.  Finally, it should be noted that when you setup the eero, you hand over a great deal of control to eero incorporated.  Since the product was made to be as simple to setup as possible, the result is that complexity is now managed by eero itself. ",

"Charles J. Gbur Jr. MD","May 31, 2016 ",4.0,"Could not be happier with this purchase!!  I live in a 2nd floor one bedroom apartment and my boyfriend lives in another one bedroom on the first floor in the same complex.  There is a big 3 bedroom townhouse style apartment in between them.  Previously I had the newest Apple Airport Extreme in my place and we had an Apple Airport Express in his to repeat my connection.  His internet was always pretty weak and unreliable (he confessed just how bad only after we installed the eero).  After doing some research into mesh network router systems and seeing the great reviews for the eero system (and the fact that it was $100 off the usual price) I decided to give it a try.  I got the pack of 3 expecting to have the main one in my place right up against the wall and the 2nd and 3rd in his place to cover the whole apartment.    Initial setup of the first unit with the eero iPhone app was a breeze.  The app also found the second but said the connection was too weak after several attempts.  I was bummed so I told the app to stop trying at which point it said there was an update available for the main unit.  After the update I tried to connect to the 2nd again and it worked.  Then the app ran the update for the 2nd.  Those 2 alone were all we needed to COMPLETELY blanket his apartment (back to the farthest corner) and mine.  I setup the 3rd (and let run the update) just because we had it.    The app provides so much great information and is super easy to use.  This is a system I fully expect to keep for many many years as it can grow and adjust to whatever living situation we find ourselves in.    Only negative I can say is that the USB port on the eero can't yet be used to connect an external hard drive for file sharing so for now my Airport Extreme is continuing to do that job on my network after adjusting it's settings to be in Bridge Mode only.  It's an extra annoying piece of tech that I hope I can retire in the coming months if eero adds that functionality via an update.    I highly recommend the eero Home WiFi System.  Depending on your home situation you might even want to start with only one or two and see how well they cover the area before adding more.  The flexibility, reliability, coverage, and ease of use make this the very BEST WiFi system I have ever owned (and I've had just about every router Apple released). ",
kevrev,"December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"About six weeks ago I set up an eero mesh network in my house, and my wifi system has never been better.    Previously I was using the base station that came with my FIOS system, and it was dog slow and had trouble reaching the far areas of the house.  My wifi routinely crapped out when I was on an iPad or laptop.  It would have 3 bars, then 1, then nothing.  Even when devices could see it, the network connection was incredibly pokey and watching Netflix or whatever was dicey.  We thought it was just network congestion, but actually it was the bad wifi.  I also had an Apple base station I've had for years and it wasn't much better.    I set up the Eero, and it was a quick proposition.  One eero station plugged into the FIOS base station, and three more are scattered around the house.  Now I have the rich clean bath of fast wifi all over the house that I wanted.  I never have trouble streaming HD video.  When one base station goes out, which has happened a couple of times, unplugging it and replugging it in has brought it back.    Couple nitpicks - the eero base stations are picky about placement.  They cannot be too far away from each other.  they have real trouble going through more than one wall or a lot of shelves full of stuff. i want to put some on my walls or tucked away but they need to be a little more prominent in order to get a good signal.  I don't love having eeros sitting on my shelves but as I move them around i can find unobstrusive spots to put them in that still work.  Also the speed test that eero shows on the app is quite a bit faster than what speedtest.net shows on a laptop connected to the network.  Another nitpick is price.  two hundo for a base station isn't cheap.  But the configuration is so quick and easy that it's worth it to me.  I wanted fast, reliable wifi everywhere in my house, and i don't have time to configure routers all day, so it was worth it for me. ",
Gary,"December 5, 2016 ",5.0,"We picked this up on Prime Day, which I thought was a pretty good price.  We have had other extenders before, but with a normal extender it creates a new wifi name so your devices are constantly having to switch depending on where you are, and it causes issues with connected devices like our Sonos. Eero allows you to setup a seamless wifi system that has the same name regardless of where you are at in the condo, and allows all our connected devices to work seamlessly.  Overall I have been very happy, but there are a few things of note:     - The wifi signal does get slower (not by a ton) the farther you get away from the 1st unit, so I suggest putting that unit closest to your major bandwidth hogs   - We have had a few issues with the devices, which usually resolve themselves, but worse case you have to unplug them and plug them back in.  I will say that generally they work error free.   - They have a reasonable level of customization available, but if you have a lot of networking requirements I suggest you check out their site first.  I don't remember what it was that we lost when we ditched our old network, but I remember it was something we felt we could ultimately live with based on the extra convenience we were getting. ",
"Matthew Weirath","April 19, 2016 ",5.0,"Love this thing. House is about 3700 sq ft and has some dead spots in corners and on back porch around pool. I have used the Netgear Plug-In Wi-Fi Range Extenders over the past year and yes they do work....problem with these is every time you move into another area that is covered by one you have to login into that extender so there is no smooth transition throughout the house. Someone recommended the eero system and after researching it I decided to take the leap and purchase it. It's amazingly simple to set up and speeds are improved, doubled in my situation compared to range extenders. I think it's a lot of money to drop down but after using it for a couple months I am very pleased and would do it again. NO switching to the closest extender anymore, just works wherever you go using the mesh network within your home. I have coverage in the dead spots and out by the pool. I have a Pentair pool wifi controller, WD My Cloud network drive and Sonos bridge all connected through a switch that is connected through the wired eero box. This was the only tricky part using the ATT gateway that is located in a not so ideal laundry room. You must have one of the eero boxes hardwired so I hooked mine up in the office (not the laundry room with the gateway directly) and it worked thankfully. Took a little work to reconnect devices to the new eero network (most people won't have this problem I'm guessing) and then everything was accessible. ",

"Ed Wilkinson","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Thanks to eero's Home WiFI System my transition to Smart Home technologies is now HIGHLY responsive.  Starting with my AMAZON Echo, I began adding WeMo devices throughout my two story home.  All worked fine, albeit occasionally with a slight &#34;lag&#34;.  Then after installing a Nexia WiFi Thermostat with my new Heat-pump, connectivity became more of a challenge.  So, I got the Three Pack.  And, WOW!!  All of my WiFi devices reported FOUR (or if the device showed 5) BAR full connectivity.  Responsive - I merely mention to Alexa that I want to turn something on or off; or to raise or lower thermostat temperature and it's accomplished in an instant; when connecting to my WiFi notebook out on the back deck my download speed &#34;pegs the meter&#34;.  WOW!    Now to set up:  It's so easy it is almost embarrassing.  It took all of 5 minutes to connect the entire 3 Pack System providing total home coverage just by following the directions on the erro app.  As a Boomer I frequently rely on my 13 Year Old Nephew for &#34;Tech Support&#34;.

"Amazon Customer","March 25, 2016 ",4.0,"We have had the eero 3-unit system for a few months and it has been amazing. Extremely easy to install and setup. We live in a 100 year-old 4-story brick house and the Wifi + extender was just not getting the job done.  I probably could add one more extender as the base is on the top floor, but it is working brilliantly. The signal strength stays very consistent and we have had minimal interruptions since installation.    I will say that once there is an interruption with one of the units, you have to remove it from the network and then add it back in - at least that is the only way I could reset the unit. We have regularly 12-14 different devices connected with a maximum DSL speed of 11-12mbps. Highly recommend the eero system. ",

Abhi,"March 28, 2017 ",5.0,"Works really well - I'm getting much faster streaming between network devices (I currently have Tivo Minis in other rooms that stream off a regular Tivo Premiere over wifi) - I do have FIOS so I just plugged the first eero as a router into the FIOS modem-router (and shut off all wifi antennae from the FIOS router) so all my devices now work on the eero-based network.The other thing that the eero wifi system has solved is random disconnects by devices. All my devices have stable connections - the eero app makes administration super simple. As a point of reference, I used to have the 3 router setup before where I'd manually configured them and it was a pain and very unreliable. So I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to replace a multi-router setup with something seamless like we see in modern office buildings. ",

R.S.,"August 6, 2016 ",5.0,"I am 1 week into having eero set up at home and four days in at my small business. My home is a good size, sprawling ranch. I've had trouble for the whole time I have lived here getting consistent wifi coverage all over the house. Two particular problems were the master bedroom (which is on the other side of the house from where the internet signal comes in on DSL) and the basement. I've used two (and sometimes three) apple wifi routers (two extremes sometimes with one airport) along with trying various other supplemental wifi options (those powerline type devices, or even setting up a separate WIFI coming off one of the extremes to try to push signal into the basement), etc etc etc.  I'm vey technical and have been chronically frustrated.    I literally set up the whole eero system in less about 15 minutes. It was ridiculously easy. I was compelled by their two way radios (one set for the eero devices to communicate with each other about which was doing what) and one for pushing signal around the house (most wifi systems with extenders of any sort are doing everything on one set of radios, even if many antennas).    Okay, 1 week in, Totally amazed. This has fixed EVERYTHING I had struggled with for at least a decade in this house. It's amazing. The signal on my wifi now is strong everywhere in the house, like amazing conveyance of speed I have to work with, strong. It's even made my Ring Doorbell work much better (and that was quite a frustration in itself due to wifi issues). Best part of all: Master bedroom how have huge bandwidth and strong connection to wifi.  And, I've never had as good of connection as I do now in my basement office. My Apple computer in basement is seeing speeds it has never enjoyed before. I am a fan.    Adding to this the regular updates and patches (which is not done on most other routers), I am supremely happy. So happy, got another system for the real office away from my home. I have an issue still to work through there to get my Macs to see the server through the eero (PCs all see it perfectly), but that will resolve once I meet with my tech quy and adjust some things. But the perfection of this solution at my house.  Wow. I was hesitant to spend THIS much money but now I'm so glad this option exists and I'd have paid even more to have it. ",

I tried Netgear and nothing improved the situation. My son told me to check out EERO. This company, their products are game changing. It is easy to install, app works brilliantly, no more dead spots, no TV issues. We have a guesthouse and were told by AT&T we needed to add service and they said no way to  get WiFi; with eero we have super WiFi. I know this is a pricey product but it works. Their support is awesome (though I only called with questions before I purchased - haven't needed any support post purchase). The 'pods' only need and electric outlet (they come with a nice length cord). The app lets you know if they are properly placed for best results. EERO is a GREAT product! (and a great company)    30-DAY UPDATE - eero still works like a champion. It has solved our dead spot or slow speed areas (only issue remains is AT&T Gigapower still goes out for a couple minutes at a time several times a week and if you are live streaming it is a pain BUT eero gives the TV very high download speed).

"John - Music City USA","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I have two houses, each with unique challenges.  House 1: L shaped, with a mylar wrap on the exterior walls. The may as well be a Faraday cage. I have struggled to get a solid, seamless WiFi network throughout the house, using multiple WAP's. When I saw the Eero, i jumped on it, not realizing that i bought the first week of public release (and started with firmware 1.0.0). I had to get them in bridge mode, as i already had a dual WAN router providing redundant ISP access and Cat 5 cable run throughout the house. The first week or so was a bumpy ride, but support was amazing, especially for a brand new device. (One of the units was defective, replacement arrived in 2 business days.) Now I have seamless WiFi throughout 6,000 square feet on three levels.  House 2: Basic rectangle with full basement, but no existing network wiring and the cable modem all the way at one end. Even worse, no way to run cable until i am willing to tear out the basement ceiling. After my experience with House #1, i figured lets give it a try. This system has the cable modem in bridge mode and the Eero as the router. Over a short period, the (Android) app has bloomed into a full featured configuration tool. Simple for a novice, but jump to the advanced sections and find a pretty robust set of management tools not found in many residential routers.

"Amazon Customer","July 8, 2016 ",5.0,"Is not compatible with my DSL service (Earthlink through AT&T.)

Which basically disables all the smart functions like being able to monitor connections, etc.  I kept it for a month to see how it did. It did make connectivity much broader in my home--extending the range considerably.  But with a slow DSL service that just meant more people and more equipment were using an already crappy slow connection.  I also found the connection to be slower with Google Hangouts with video connections very iffy.  So returned it--cost me about a hundred dollars since I waited a bit beyond the 30 day window.

In particular, I wanted a system with zero handoff so I could move to anywhere I had Wifi coverage in my house without dropping a phone call.  And eero does this quite well.  I have absolutely zero cellular coverage at my home from any carrier.    Prior to purchasing my eero system I tried many times to configure my many Wifi routers and access points distributed throughout my home.  Although it was easy enough to get less expensive routers to cooperate enough to work together, there was no way to accomplish the zero handoff.  Until eero, I consistently dropped calls as I moved from one Wifi connection to another in my home.    By using a lan scanning program, you can see that eero uses the same SSID and channel number for the Wifi router and access points, and uses the same channel for all 2.4 ghz access and all 5 ghz access respectively.    Setup is easy, but manual configuration is limited... although with the smooth automatic configuring to allow cooperation between access points I did not feel limited in what I needed to do.    To sum up, I get very reliable Wifi coverage for my computers, smart home products, TV and video systems, and zero handoff for Wifi calling applications.  All with very good through-put, frequently maxing out the internet speed supplied by my ISP (see photo).  My only reason for not providing 5 stars is the system cost. ",
allgrace,"February 24, 2017 ",5.0,"Great product. It really works    This system is great. I have had the system for 1 month and I have not had to reboot for over 1 month. My internet speed is constant throughout my network. I have 1 eero unit- my desktop that is furthest away from the base - about 60-75 feet internet connection rests at good.  This is the same desktop which failure to connect/no network available had caused drama for 4 months.    Customer service personal was friendly and easy to talk too.    Thank you for a wonderful product ",
"Juice Man","July 9, 2016 ",4.0,"I bought a total of 6 eeros to install in my home based on their claim to provide hyper fast internet and the use of just one wireless network. I work from home so I VPN all the time, dedicated connection. Because of my work, I chose to keep my Netgear equipment, which is made of X8 and a R7000 extender plus AC outlet extender, too. I installed both, eeros and left my original Netgear install to see how it worked. As usual, my Netgear continued to deliver, I run 105 Mbps which translates into 70-90 Mbps wireless but with the eeros was a constant 20 Mbps at the most, except standing next to the eero plugged to the modem. I followed recommended setting and unplugged my Netgear router and tested again, without success, eero speed remained 20 Mbps. Let me be clear, eero is a good solution for someone who has not a minimal idea how to plug a router and needs a wifi setup, which most ISP companies will help you install anyways; but to claim hyper speeds, I think it's not the right claim at least not in my home. I kept my Netgear and now I'm learning how to set different Access points throughout my home so I can use the same SSID. ",
"eero support","September 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Sometimes a start up product comes along that is actually better than anticipated or advertised, and from my experience the eero is certainly one of those few.  I am a relatively older (therefore less techie) heavy user of the Internet and its required infrastructure, but I have to say this was one of the easiest set ups of technology I've ever experienced, and it works even better than advertised.

"L. Herman","September 10, 2016 ",2.0,"I have read some of the bad reviews on this device and am glad that I had zero bad experiences.  I have extensive experience with wifi extenders and routers (This replaced a nighthawk x8 netgear router).  It was simplicity to set up and connect to create a whole home network.  I live in an older home (1892) with Plaster walls and Brick and getting signals across 4 stories (basement) was almost impossible.  Not anymore.  Everything works perfectly and I have been running it for over a month.  Great product and the pucks are well designed.  5 stars across the board! ",
"Michael G.","March 24, 2016 ",5.0,"We've struggled for years with our wifi. I thought we'd tried everything - upgraded to top-of-the-line routers, extenders, and even hired a local company to install a switch and wired access points. None of these solutions worked, so when I heard the initial positive reviews of eero I figured we'd give it a try, and if it didn't work just return it.    Six months later, and we haven't looked back. We went from multiple complaints a day, to never having to worry about router problems or bad signals. And if there ever is a problem with internet, it is always problem with the signal coming into the house.    For a 4300 sq ft house, I had expected to need 4 units, so bought a 3-pack plus 1 extra, but actually the 3-pack more than covers every corner of the house and most of the front and backyard, so we returned the extra.    I can't recommend this system enough. It's really worth every penny, and we're much happier with it than with the custom setup that we'd spent way more on... ",
David,"September 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought the eero unit (individual) because my living-room and back porch were a wifi dead spot at my house. I have a ethernet cable running from my router to home theater center. I placed the eero unit in the cabinet with the ethernet cable running to it. I downloaded the app on my iphone and in minutes my eero was up and running. My living room and back porch are now totally covered in a strong wifi signal. Not only that but it reaches to the corner of my back yard. I am totally impressed with how well this unit has worked out for me. I can not recommend this unit more. I give eero an A+ ",
keith,"October 29, 2016 ",5.0,"Beyond simplicity, finally, something that really work an Erro solved in the most simple (Not cheap but no expensive).  I'm so glad to have been bought eero devices and it was not just for me, my wife loved it; she is not technical and not having to switch between 6 different networks around my house is fantastic for her and I don't have to provide technical support for everyone anymore and I don't have to explain why I have so many WIFI networks :).

"Gonzalo Alberto Gomez A","June 12, 2016 ",5.0,"I don't write many reviews but this product is great.  The set up was very easy and really increased my speed.  I bought a smart door bell and was getting 2mb outside with my door closed.  This was causing the video connection from the door to be slow.  After purchasing this I'm now getting 30mb outside the door.  I placed the pucks in the same place as my extenders in my old system.  You can see from the speed test pic that the two early dates was run when I bought the smart door bell with my old router.  The top dates are after installing eero.  Again, this is a great product!

"Thomas C. Masters","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"This is the first (and only) &#34;mesh&#34; network that I have purchased, so I cannot compare eero to its competitors in that category.  I had a traditional network set up using Apple routers and Netgear extenders and eero was a tremendous upgrade.    First of all the set up was very simple using the app.  The app is easy to use and intuitive.  Setting up several units took less than 20 minutes.  When choosing eero, this was one of the factors that influenced my decision over Netgear's product in which the app appeared dated (at least at the time I'm writing this).    Most importantly though is that eero just works.  I struggled with random dead spots all over my home (despite having repeaters literally 15 ft from the devices) and I am no longer having this issue.    While certainly more expensive than many products, the product does what it's supposed to do and delivers coverage all over my house. ",
"Lex Raas","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Have a ranch style cottage Maui, Hawaii and was struggling to get coverage in all rooms, presto, eero came to the rescue. Follow instructions carefully and test best locations for installation. Solved my problems 100% ! ",
"eero support","December 26, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought this set to use in Hong Kong where flats are tiny and have many concrete walls which normally block wifi signal. One thing I missed was that Eero does not support PPPoe while my ISP is using such setting, the only way to solve this issue is router on router.    I went straight to Apple Store to buy an Airport Extreme and an Airport Express (thanks to the return policy) to try. I plugged in the Airport Extreme and tried the wifi signal, hoping it can cover my tiny flat. In the living room the speed was 90mbs out of 100mbs, while in the study it dropped to 20mbs which is unacceptable.    Desperately, I used the router on router option for Eero and placed one in living room and another one in study room. I did the speed test again and WOW! 90mbs in both the living room and study room! It dropped to 70mbs in master bedroom and kitchen which is acceptable, but I can always add another Eero if needed in the future.    Satisfied with the result, I took away the Airport Extreme and tried the setting with Airport Express, same testing result. So Airport Extreme is going back to Apple. ",
A.C.,"July 26, 2016 ",5.0,"Great product!  I was skeptical at first if this system would solve our never-ending network frustrations.  The system was super easy to install and has worked perfectly from day one.  We have a large, three story home with a structure outside of the home and getting an internet connection to all area was very frustrating no matter what we tried.  I contacted Customer Support yesterday for a brief question and the rep was very courteous and extremely helpful.  Eero is wonderful! ",
"Amazon Lover","July 21, 2016 ",4.0,"I'm a techie, and am used to having to tinker with stuff to get it working just right. With the eeros, everything just worked. I have had 0 problems, and cannot find any place in my ~3000sqft house where I don't have excellent coverage. I have never seen the wifi symbol on my iPhone drop from full bars.    You can hang out on the eero Reddit forums to see technical staff answer all sorts of questions from users, showing the world what their secret sauce is to their technology. They seem really dedicated to their customers.    I replaced 2 Apple Time Capsules with a 3 pack. I get my FIOS 100/100 plan almost everywhere I go in the house (and atleast 50/50 in the spots furthest from an eero node). I have had 0 complaints from anyone in my family since setting this up (including the wife!). ",
"Brian Doherty","August 19, 2016 ",5.0,"On paper, these two companies are similar. They are startups that are well funded, and have recently launched devices that are about the size of an Apple TV or an Apple Airport Express. You typically buy a pack of 3, plugging one into your modem and the others to ethernet or leave alone and they will create a wireless mesh network. eero has been the market longer than luma.  If you have Sonos, then you are already familiar with mesh networks. Like Sonos, these devices can talk to each other via wireless, as long as each one can &#34;see&#34; the other. From there they re-distribute the wifi signal creating a constant amount of coverage.    These devices are also incredibly easy to setup and manage (in theory). You do everything from your phone app. And you can manage your network from anywhere. They are cloud powered routers. eero has written a lot about their cloud operations. Impressive.    However, that is where the comparisons end. I have used both devices now and can weigh in on which one is better.     I got an eero for my father and set that up in May. I also got a Luma for myself, and waited a few months longer to get that. Then I also got an eero for myself after some disappointing results with the luma.    Below is my experience with both.    Unboxing  The clear winner here is eero. The simple explanation is that the eero is like unboxing an Apple Product. The box is easy to open, the materials are top notch (glossy white plastic and soft touch rubber). The charger and finishes are exactly what you would get from an Apple Product.    The Luma on the other hand feels cheap. The power plug is gray, but exactly like any other electronic product. The device box is cheap plastic feeling.   For many people this device will be visible in their home (like it is for my parents) and so I think this matters.    Oh, almost forgot. It was comical hard to actually open the luma box. No product should be hard to get out.    Winner: eero    Setup  To set up each device, you install their iOS app, then plug in the first device and go through the setup process.    The eero device completed setup in under 10 seconds. It was what I expected, so I didn't think much of it.    The luma device took a very long time to setup and failed multiple times. This repeated with each device I set up. It was a bit baffling to be honest.  Once the devices are set up, you are now ready to add more devices.    Winner: eero    Software updates  Both devices manage software updates automatically. With the eero you can see what version you have. The software updates automatically overnight, and in the latest app update they added a mode where you can force an update. You can even see release notes here.    The luma does not show you any information about what version of the software it's running and there is no way to update, or see release notes or anything.    It's worth noting, that when I was setting up my father's eero devices, the software updates never came down. I called eero and talked to a live person and he was pretty amazing at getting it resolved. It took a few calls and emails and they determined that one of the devices was faulty and they overnight shipped a replacement the next day. I didn't have a chance to work with luma on anything like that, but the experience with eero was very impressive.    Winner: eero    Phone App  As I mentioned you do everything from the phone app. In the case of the eero I can manage my network and my Dad's from the same app. When I next visit my sister, I plan to get her setup with eero as well and I'm guessing she will need at least 5 devices.    In each phone app you can do things like manage your wifi setup and password, choose a guest network (and share the network name and password), see all the connected devices and also create profiles for each person in the house and do some basic parental controls.  Right now, I think the luma app has the edge because it has a visual map of your wifi coverage which I find handy.     Winner: luma    Parental Controls  Both apps offer basic parental controls. The reason I wanted to get the luma was that they had said they would offer very deep parental controls. In that time eero added parental controls and luma still hasn't delivered on what they said they would offer.    Here is the deal. They are both limited at this right now. The best parental control device (and generally useful network management device) is the Circle with Disney. I will review this soon, but I can tell you right now that it's 5 star.    Circle, the most advanced parental control device    Winner: tie    Reliability and Performance  These are highly complex devices making your life simple and easy. The first few months for eero were bumpy and that's also true for luma. Amazon Reviewers rate the eero far higher than luma (4.4 star for eero vs 2.9 stars for luma). There are some very troubling issues with luma that will be resolved with time. For one thing, the Amazon rating trajectory for them is rather bad. They will need to fix this.    The biggest issue I immediately ran into with luma was that every few hours, my iPhone, PC, iPad would spin for a few seconds before completing a task such as loading a web page.    I though maybe that was just me.... but no, my wife and kids noticed it to. I did some light trouble shooting turning parental controls off and so on (this is before we had the Circle).     I also did a lot of speed tests. I have 120 Mbps service from Comcast and with the Luma not once did I ever see sustained performance hard wired. The eero however has constantly been clocking in at my full bandwidth.  In the end, my tolerance for this stuff is super low. Internet needs to work always and work well. I returned the luma after 2 days and my life with the eero has been glorious.    Winner: eero    Cost  The luma is cheaper. This is by design as eero was the first to market and has a lot of mindshare. To get people to pay attention, I believe luma undercut them (the 3 pack is $100 cheaper from luma).  However, this is an important investment for your house. I would not recommend getting the luma due to its lower cost. That $100 could be a big deal in the long run.    When purchasing I'd recommend getting the 3 pack as each device is priced at $166 vs $199 individuals. There is also a 2 pack. I got one 3 and one 2 pack.    Winner: luma    Final Thoughts  It's really exciting to  me that wifi is entering a new era. Surround wifi will solve dead spot and coverage issues for so many families.    I fully expect the luma to resolve a number of the problems I identified. However, at this time the eero has been in the market longer, and is the clear leader.    I am super happy with my setup. I now have 5 eero devices in my house, they are all hard wired except for the one. I have replaced everything else powering wifi in the house and it's glorious.     I highly recommend getting eeros.    Winner: eero ",
"Omar Shahine","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"No WiFi drops. Not a one in the last month of having the Eero network installed in my house.

"David H.","August 29, 2016 ",5.0,"I have waited a couple of months before posting this review. My situation is a 2 story house with a staircase in the middle. This causes dead spots when a single router is in the house as the middle stairwell gets in the way. I had tried a range extender with not much luck as although I was in a deadspot with my old router, it would not transition to the extender or when it did I had already lost connection on what I was doing as I walked around. Getting fed up with this, I decided to try the 3 Eero set as it was on sale. My pack of 3 included one lemon that Eero replaced quickly, and their support team was very helpful. I should note that I have 2 of the 3 hard wired in. I am happy to say that since getting them set up, I haven't had a single issue of dead spots. I can walk around my house freely streaming videos or even on skype/FaceTime and I don't have dropped call issues that I had previously. It turned out to be everything that I had hoped for and I am very happy with my purchase. ",

MerrickM,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"The configuration of our house makes a consistent WiFi signal difficult.  The modem has to be upstairs, which makes the reception in the downstairs bedrooms difficult to impossible.  I purchased a signal extender, which worked for a while, but never well or consistently.  When I read about eero, I was very interested.  True to the review, it was VERY easy to set up, with one exception.  It took me a while to figure out the best way to get my Sonos working again.  My wife is far more into Sonos than she is exceptional WiFi coverage, so she quickly declared it a bust.  However, with a little bit of research, I very quickly solved that problem and we now have spotless and fast WiFi in areas where we had no WiFi before. I also have younger kids who love to log back in when it's lights out...eero allows me to schedule their WiFi access, so I can shut them down at night.  I love this product and am considering one more unit in a far corner of our house to make sure our outdoor deck is covered as well. ",
"Sanjay Mathur","May 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I replaced my existing Asus RT-AC68U plus Apple Airport Express setup with an Eero 3-pack.  I initially had trouble the first day after installing due to the out of the box Hardware having v1.0 firmware.  I contacted support that day and got prompt responses from Nick.  The Eero units all upgraded their firmware the first night and since then I've had no issues whatsoever.  The speeds I get on iOS devices and laptops throughout the house are amazing, where before I had a lot of dead spots and areas where my devices didn't switch networks.  I'm happy to tinker with firmware (was using merlin-wrt on my Asus) but the ease of use and simplicity of the Eero has won me over.  Clearly if you want the ability to fine tune things in firmware, this is not your option.  However, considering the quality of connectivity across our house (wired and wireless), I'm quite impressed.    Unlike other reviewers who are using the mesh / hop approach, I have hardwired all of my Eero's as I'd already run the cables.  My results are better because of this, so I can't comment on how well the system would work if two of units were just wireless repeaters. ",

Rcat274,"January 1, 2017 ",4.0,"I ordered this product because I was dissatisfied with the wi-fi situation in my home. My home has ethernet that runs through the walls so two eeros had a physical connection through an ethernet cable while one eero had to do connect wirelessly.    Having a physical connection to the eero greatly enhances download and upload speeds around the home. Two eeros were placed upstairs and then one eero downstairs. It is slightly true that more or less, the eeros have to be &#34;within sight&#34; of each other for best connectivity to the other eeros in the system. Otherwise you will be prompted saying the connectivity strength is not as strong as it could be.    This product was purchased because we have several chomecasts and mobile devices throughout my home. Now no need to switch to different wi-fi networks to connect to the chromecast that we need. No complaints. The physical size of the eero is much smaller than I anticipated. Overall great product. ",

whit,"September 12, 2016 ",5.0,"Installed my eero yesterday. BLUF: download speed increased 3x, upload increased 2x.  My average download speed with my old ASUS1200gr was 6.4mps. (I did 3 speed tests in each corner of my house as well as my family room and too the average.).  Once I installed the eero, the average jumped to 19.09mps.  I pay for 25mps.  Of note, my family room reading (I do streaming tv) went from 16.8mps to 24.94mps.  My daughter's bedroom (had the slowest speed in the house) went from a download speed of 0.86mps to 15.65mps!  Admittedly, I did have one hiccup and that's that I have fiber optic so instead of a modum, I have a switch so that caused an initial failure of the install routine. I called the support number and the lady on the other end troubleshot the install (took two more attempts before the nature of the problem was found. The solution was to leave my ASUS router in place as a bridge and connect the eero to it. Not the most elegant solution but I didn't have another use for the ASUS anyway. ",

I ripped out my home brew and put the eero three pack behind on zyxel firewall and I've been very impressed by it.  Even my 4 and 6 year old kids immediately remarked about the improvement.

"Jason Beal","August 14, 2016 ",5.0,"Before Eero my house was plagued by a terrible wifi signal, from which my phone would randomly disconnect, with which my tv communicated only sporadicly, and whose speed was only bearable while within a few feet of the router. (And this was apple's latest $200 router.)    Installation was like having coffee with an old friend, only it took less time. In minutes my entire 3000sf house was bathed in sweet, beautiful, fast, reliable wifi.    The app is beautifully designed and perfectly functional. Have a look at apple's &#34;wifi utility&#34; if you want to know what bad app design looks like and why it matters. To me eero--apple feels like Tesla--GMC.    Oh, AND it's nice looking! So far, nothing bad to say, and all of my wifi anxiety and frustration has been eliminated from my daily anxieties and frustrations. A rare home run in new technology options. Highly recommended. ",
"Kent W Dayton","April 20, 2017 ",5.0,"The easiest setup of any router that I've used so far; better than Apple Time Capsule and Linksys.  The nice aesthetics is a plus: you can place the eero stations in plain sight without your wife complaining about some ugly piece of technology being out in the open like the Linksys line of devices.  I did run into a problem where my cable modem (Arris SB6183) firmware caused conflicts with the eero (which is documented on their web site).  My ISP was unable/unwilling to update the firmware, so I had to upgrade my modem (SB6190) and now all is well.  It is a pricey system, but well worth it when considering the setup ease and reliability of the system.  I haven't had to restart my eeros like I had to with other routers.  You'll be happy with them. ",

"Tech guy","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"Purchased 4 of these to cover 4 k sq ft home and guest house. The house has lots of concrete walls which made getting signal everywhere challenging. Prior to Eero I used a router, access point and two range extenders. All together counting, 2.4G and 5G, I had 5 different networks on the property. In the past I have also used repeaters. None of these solutions were satisfactory. Besides the multiple networks there were still dead zones, network drop outs, and most annoying the need to keep changing the network name for the laptop/phone depending where you were on the property. Installation of this product was flawless. I had all 4 routers up an running in less than 30 minutes. The connection is strong now throughout the property. Speed is slower for the most distant boxes but still 2-3X what I was getting from my prior setup and very acceptable at 20+Meg. Handoff between the boxes is mostly perfect but on rare occasions I need to turn wifi off on the client device and back on. I have not had any problems with boxes disconnecting or the red light coming on. Yes it is an expensive solution but when I consider the frustration I have had dealing with the coverage problem, the cost of buying the hottest next generation router, hoping that would fix the problem, the inconvenience of continually changing the network name as moved about, and the occasional cost of hiring a network expert to try to solve the problem (unsuccessfully) I consider it one of my better investments.

DMJ,"March 8, 2016 ",5.0,"I have a four story town house with Verizon Fios coming in at the lowest level.  With an Apple router of the latest design I got very good speed on the first level, but already on the second with my smartphone I sometimes lost a bar, and despite a signal extender the signal was slow and weak on higher floors.  A three pack from Eero fixed us up, and the setup took only a few minutes.  The setup is guided by the smartphone app, which worked flawlessly.  First, you unplug your router and disconnect whatever you've been using for wi-fi.  Then you run an ethernet cable from your router to the first Eero, turn on the power, and follow the very simple directions in the app.  Very soon you are registered, you name the network and the password, and Eero no. 1 is pumping out signal.  Then I went up to the kitchen, on the second level, and powered up No. 2 there.  You then bring it to life with the app, again following VERY simple instructions.  Then I went up to the fourth level and plugged in the final one, again following the app's instructions.  Result -- a good, strong signal everywhere in the house, 35 megabits/second everywhere above the first floor.  Exactly as advertised and with just a few minutes of setup.  Pricey, but entirely satisfactory. ",
Kiteboy,"January 26, 2017 ",5.0,"My MBs per second went from 15mb to 85mb and a strong signal throughout the house.

Also, super easy to setup. No more IP addresses.  Get an Eero. ",
Chris,"November 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I have had this system for about three weeks nows covering a 3000 square foot house and 800 square foot basement for a house built in 1942. The plaster and mesh construction pretty much makes every room a Faraday cage. I bought a three pack and an additional unit for a room over the garage which I almost don't need. With this setup I get 5 bars through the house and even in my front and back yard. I have slow, crummy U-Verse but this system pipes it through the house faster than anything else I've used and that include a top of the line D-Link system with multiple repeaters and wired access points. Setting up Eero is super simple if you already have a good internet connection into your home. Bridging newer U-Verse modems is somewhat tricky but that's not the fault of Eero. I wish this setup was a bit less expensive but I can't fault its performance, nothing at any price point performs this well with such simple configuration in the consumer space. I expect others will catch up in the next 6 months or so with competing offering but if you need something today I can't recommend anything else. My only reservation would be what some other views have noted. Eero is a startup and if something where to happen to them these would turn into paper weights pretty quickly. ",

We are very satisfied with the results as we are using lots of computers and TVs throughout the house. Since the system has been installed there was no need for re setting the modem/router anymore.

The coverage in my long condo is consistent in all corners and rooms.  I am very pleased with the devices.  Stylish and clean looking.    I'd like to see more reporting in the app on performance within the network.

The second Eero I attempted to install in the mid-level wouldn't connect.  Proceeding to the third box, in the top level just above our basement Eero, it connected fine.  Then I attempted the second box again and no problems.    Basically, you have to be prepared to let Eero build your network over again.    But now we have full bandwidth everywhere in our house.

"Jay A. Warren","April 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I had a specific reason for purchasing the eero wifi product... blanketing my home with Wifi signal so I could reliably use the Wifi Calling mode on my iPhone.  In particular, I wanted a system with zero handoff so I could move to anywhere I had Wifi coverage in my house without dropping a phone call.  And eero does this quite well.  I have absolutely zero cellular coverage at my home from any carrier.    Prior to purchasing my eero system I tried many times to configure my many Wifi routers and access points distributed throughout my home.  Although it was easy enough to get less expensive routers to cooperate enough to work together, there was no way to accomplish the zero handoff.  Until eero, I consistently dropped calls as I moved from one Wifi connection to another in my home.    By using a lan scanning program, you can see that eero uses the same SSID and channel number for the Wifi router and access points, and uses the same channel for all 2.4 ghz access and all 5 ghz access respectively.    Setup is easy, but manual configuration is limited... although with the smooth automatic configuring to allow cooperation between access points I did not feel limited in what I needed to do.    To sum up, I get very reliable Wifi coverage for my computers, smart home products, TV and video systems, and zero handoff for Wifi calling applications.  All with very good through-put, frequently maxing out the internet speed supplied by my ISP (see photo).  My only reason for not providing 5 stars is the system cost. ",

"P. K.","December 7, 2016 ",5.0,"Ok, I've had these in place for a few months now. Long enough to have an opinion.    First of all, they are very &#34;Appleish&#34; in the design and appearance. Even the packaging. It is quite nice. Assuming you have an iphone or ipad to run the app on, the setup is very simple and nearly foolproof. To be fair, I didn't try the Android app but based on other reviews, it appears that the ios app is more refined. They have simplified the product setup (perhaps too much?) and made it a breeze for anyone, even without technical knowledge, to get these up and running quickly and painlessly.    Once the 3 APs are up and connected to each other, &#34;it just works&#34;. Bravo! I can attest that these absolutely fixed WiFi dead spots and weak signals throughout my house. I replaced an Asus 802.11ac router/AP with these and the difference has been fantastic. Yes, yes... I know, some of you are screaming about &#34;if you know how to configure.. blah blah blah&#34;. I know how to configure it - I've got many many years and all the silly certificates and whatnot. That isn't the issue.    The app has a really nice indicator with status and how many devices are connected. One very nice addition is the speed test. You &#34;pull down&#34; the screen and it runs a speed test and displays the results right in the app. Nice touch. I also like that I can create and share a guest network in seconds with the app. Very nice. The lack of physical ports on the devices isn't that big a deal. A cheap switch plugged into one of those solves that problem forever.    Now for the not so great...    Because this is simplified for anyone to get it up and running and even manage it, it lacks some advanced features or tweaks. I have some wireless devices that are a little bit finicky. A thermostat for example works like a champ on 2.4 GHz but has erratic connectivity on 5. Don't know why, it just does. The app would benefit from an &#34;expert mode&#34; or something like that where I could define those things. I also would like to have the option to define the channel being used. If that is some kind of magical &#34;we pick the best one for you&#34; type of thing, I'd like the option to see that data. Finally, lets talk about the price shall we? This is a pretty expensive product. You could get the same &#34;mesh&#34; functionality from Ubiquiti's UniFi or use some power-line devices if you just need to connect a couple of devices away from your modem. WiFi range extenders are a cheaper option although they aren't nearly as slick or reliable.    Then we have this awful moment;  The 2 devices that aren't wired directly into my modem would randomly disconnect and show a red status light. They'd come back after 30-60 seconds but this constant up/down cycle went on for days. Instead of fussing with it, I fired up the app, navigated through the help section and emailed support with the information requested. Then --- crickets. No acknowledgement, no reply, no help. searching some internet forums, I'm not the only one to have this issue. I basically had to remove everything and go through the setup routine all over again while moving the 2 wireless APs around a little bit to get  a better signal. Not exactly sure why it ran fine for so long then suddenly became unstable, but it did.    I thought the lack of any response from support may have just been an oversight so I followed up the original ticket with a second request. Nothing again. Unfortunately, it appears that email support is non-existent. I didn't call the phone number but, I don't think I should have to. These are not cheap by any measure. Maybe the time, money, and effort put into the pretty packaging would have been better spent ensuring that customer support was top notch. I'd rather the product came in a brown paper bag and get stellar customer support than pretty packaging but nobody to answer my email.    Overall, if you care about aesthetics and you want to cover a large area with seamless WiFi, this is a great product. If you are more price sensitive, take a look at some of the alternatives. And finally, if you are not comfortable with suspect customer service, you may want to wait while, what I assume are growing pains, are resolved before you purchase. ",
WWWWoodchuck,"August 22, 2016 ",5.0,"Perfect solution to cover a large two-story house.  We have heavy users (streaming video, game systems, multiple phones, tablets, laptops, DVRs, etc.) at every corner of the house and the three pack covers everything very nicely.  It did take 24 hours and a firmware update to get to full speed, but it took care of itself.  Running the microwave used to make every wifi device pause, but not anymore!    A setup tip:  The quality of the system is sensitive to the placement of each unit.  If a unit is not getting a good signal, try moving it 6 inches in any direction. One unit had a very poor connection when placed behind a speaker, but moving to the side on the speaker allowed a full strength signal and full speed.

JWT,"April 11, 2017 ",5.0,"The eero sets up quickly and easily as advertised but be aware of a couple of things:    1. If you like to hide your SSID like I do for added security, you can't with the eero.  When I contacted them ask about it, they said they don't offer that option.  And didn't indicate they would or planned to do so in the future.  Make sure you beef up your passwords.    2.  It looks like the system can go anywhere and you are covered.  But during setup, the instructions are the units shouldn't be more 40 ft apart and they work best if they are in line of sight.  I couldn't do that and it seems to be working.  But if you have an older house with plaster walls and metal, you might have a problem.    Overall I am happy with performance to date.

DragoninVA,"March 9, 2016 ",4.0,"We purchased the eero system in hopes of improving the Wi-Fi performance in our cement-floored town home.  It delivered on all it's promises of being very easy to set up and working simply and reliably.    Our previous system using a fairly high end consumer Netgear cable modem-Wi-Fi router, similar spec-Netgear ranger extender, a power line Ethernet extender and a Time Capsule remained intermittent to several important-but-difficult-to-reach locations.  The eero system has substantially higher data transfer rates and is reliable in all locations around the home --- and we no longer have to manually switch between six networks (2G and 5G for each of base, downstairs, and upstairs).    It is expensive, but it works.  It is beautifully packaged:  I would have preferred simpler, environmentally friendly, plain packaging regardless of any cost savings as I just feel bad throwing it away.    After my initial install, I contacted tech support about it's compatibility with the power line ethernet extender, and they (the president it appears) wrote back promptly confirming that it would work.  In the end, I have not purchased a 4th unit to place on the extender, as we are actually getting a sufficient signal through our heavy cement floor to the basement that we do not need the additional unit.    We are considering putting in an eero system in another home that has similar concrete problems, although with walls instead of floors:  it's that good, despite the cost. ",

"Matthew J. Faulkner","August 8, 2016 ",5.0,"Quite an amazing product. I have messed with WiFi for years, powerful routers, power line, repeaters, always in pursuit of raw speed in every corner of the house. My Comcast service provides 180 Mb/s and is very reliable. My issues were a dead spot in the back office, spotty Apple remote performance, a Samsung TV with a dreadful WiFi dongle, a Lenovo with a poor USB WiFi implementation and adapters randomly picking the wrong network access point. I guess after several years, WiFi cynicism creeps in and acceptance of issues happens.    Coverage is complex, but WiFi adapter settings are Pandora's Box. So many, so different, so poorly described.    I set up the eero network in an hour, carefully placing the devices throughout the house. The application is simple to use. Then I wait 24 hours for the network to be optimized (not really, heavy use of speed test). My initial tests were so, so. But in the morning, presto! 60Mb/s or higher everywhere!    Samsung TV - rock solid. Apple remote finds the Apple TVs, Lenovo goes from 40Mb/s to 80Mb/s, Office at 70Mb/s from a spotty 30Mb/s.    Sorcery.    I am delighted to hand my network management to eero and so far they are doing a great job. If you place no value on your time, this looks expensive. But the moment you realize you could be doing something else rather than learning to tame the dark art of WiFi configuration, this is a steal. ",

SPMc,"April 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I so much wanted this solution to providing a seamless Wi-Fi network to work but despite some good features it needs some improvement and updates for me to rate it more than 3 stars.  As so many reviewers have stated the set up was very quick and easy. I had 2 of the 3 units up in less than 30 minutes and that included the time for software updates that came down immediately.  Signal strength was very good and I did not have any issues with any devices (iPad, 2 laptops, 2 Galaxy S6 phones) connecting but was only on the 2.4 GHz network.  All these devices connect to my original hardware on the 5 GHz band so with eero I was connecting at half the speed.  Upon further investigation using wifi analyzer I found I was on a busy channel from overlapping neighbors.  I could not find any settings in the phone app interface to alter the configuration so called tech support.  I was told unfortunately there is no option at this time to manually set or change the channel selection. Tech support told me this might be future update as many other callers have asked for it.  Also you cannot configure the units to only use the 5 GHz band nor can you turn off the SSID broadcast.  For me these are some basic settings present in most Wi-Fi routers so I was very disappointed by lacking in this current release of the product.  In summary this product might be fine solution for many users in most environments, but the following shortcomings are why I am returning the product.  • Product needs to be able to view/edit via a web interface, not just using a phone app.  • Need to be able to configure to turn on/off 2.4 GHz or 5GHz network speed  • Set channel frequency band  • Use MAC authentication  • Turn off SSID broadcast ",

"Jim Hood","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"Trying to get a signal into all corners of our three-level house was never easy. I had to use two routers but even then there were dead spots, not to mention the necessity of running cable to the second router.

I unpacked the three eero routers and within 15 minutes, they were working perfectly without any need to fiddle with complex settings.    The app that accompanies the routers is very useful. Among other things, it lets you see each device that is on the network, its name, IP address, etc. This makes it much easier to get wireless printers, etc., working and troubleshoot them when they get cranky.

"Tom S.","April 1, 2017 ",5.0,"It's as easy to set up and amazing as advertised. I've had a dead zone in my house that I couldn't resolve with any other wifi extender and it worked with the eero. Worth the price. ",
HBSURFDOC,"January 23, 2017 ",5.0,"The Good: The Eero is a great wifi extender. I live in a split ranch house which has 3 levels and is approximately 100 feet from end to end on the main level. It's also almost 60 years old and built with material much more impervious to wifi signals than modern construction. I've tried numerous wifi routers and range extenders in an attempt to provide coverage throughout my house and, until Eero, they all failed miserably with large dead zones in various regions of the house that couldn't be eliminated no matter what I tried. Eero is the first system that I found that is able to provide not only wifi coverage, but a strong signal, throughout every room in my house. Why then am I only giving it 1 star?    The Bad: Unfortunately, both Eero software and documentation are incredibly buggy. Moreover, even when a more recent version of the software is released, the customer cannot initiate or force their devices to update and instead must wait for the update to be pushed out to their units by the Eero rolling system. In fact, I've been unable to get the update to the latest released version of the software even after contacting technical support to report an issue that I was having. This brings me to the the other major reason for my 1 star rating, customer and/or technical support, or more correctly the near absence of this support. In a little over a week, I've contacted Eero 3 times. The first time, I received a boilerplate response from their website that was totally unresponsive to the issue I raised. Not only did the text on the Eero website not contain the appropriate information that I required to install/setup the Eero system on my network but also my reply to Eero indicating that their boilerplate response didn't address the question that I specifically asked was completely ignored with no further answer or information provided. It was only through trial and error that I was able to figure out the steps that I needed to take to setup the Eero system. After completing the initial setup, I needed to open some ports on the Eero for forwarding of specific Internet communication to other devices running on my system. I soon discovered that this also didn't work as described. I again contacted Eero support, only to be told that their system indicated that the ports I was attempting to forward were indeed open. Still I could not get external communication to work. Ultimately, I discovered that, due to a bug in their software, even if your device only requires/uses TCP communication, you have to open both the TCP and UDP protocols on the port before Eero with correctly forward the communication to the appropriate device. I recontacted Eero support and was told that they're &#34;aware of this issue.&#34; Finally, I noticed that, concurrent with replace my router with Eero, my network developed terrible latency issues in communication between local devices. Devices that had near instantaneous response with the old router were now taking 2 to 6 seconds to respond and this delay was causing both software and hardware to fail. I again contacted technical support. It took 2 days to get a response, which was to escalate the issue. It took another 2 days before I heard for the escalation agent and this response just asked for more specifics on my system, which I immediately sent. Now 6 days after I originally reported the problem and 4 days after it was supposedly escalated, I'm still waiting on a response that would actually help me resolve the problem.    In summary, if it happens to work with your network out of the box, Eero is an outstanding wifi system. However, you're on your own if it doesn't. The document is inadequate, the software is buggy, and technical support is virtually non-existent. As a result, I cannot recommend this system for non-IT professionals.    Edit: 02/08/2017 - Eero now allows the user to initiate a manual update instead of waiting for the update to be rolled out to the device. ",

Bryan,"October 16, 2016 ",5.0,"I just recently received a gigabit internet connection from my ISP (Suddenlink) and was looking to replace a single Airport Extreme with something that would give me good coverage throughout my single story, 1900 sq. ft. home. I initially tried to use a second Airport Extreme in a roaming setup, but my devices simply wouldn't ever connect to the stronger signal when moving around the house. After reading the reviews on the Eero, I decided to give them a shot.    The devices themselves are certainly aesthetically pleasing and unobtrusive, although I could say the same for my Airports. This was critical as my wife would not be happy with anything unsightly in various rooms around the house. Setup was fairly quick and easy. Just as advertised, the mobile app gets the devices up and running. I had a small hiccup and initially thought it was the fault of the Eeros, but turned out to be a problem with my MoCA setup. Once I ironed out the issue with my wiring, the devices have worked very well. I've found with my particular setup, it's most advantageous to use the units in bridge mode and allow my ISP-provided cable modem/router to handle the routing duties.    Our devices roam from unit to unit seamlessly. We're mostly an Apple household with iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, iMacs and AppleTVs, but we've also got a Nest thermostat, Xbox One, PS4, Circle, Hue and other devices on the network. So far, there have been no issues and the devices I have that have AC wireless capabilities are getting pretty close to the same speeds on speedtest.net that my gigabit ethernet devices are.    I should also note that each of the three units I have are acting as hardwired access points as I have one unit plugged directly into my cable modem, another unit hardwired by CAT 6 ethernet and the third unit hardwired over MoCA 2.0/coax. I have not attempted to use these in strictly wireless mode, which I'm sure is what most people will use them in. My main concern was roaming and these work perfectly in that regard. ",

"Kirk Strauser","January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"I'm not going to detail my geek cred, but suffice it to say for these purposes that I usually build my own Linux-based routers. I'm not allergic to solder or compiling kernels. But I bought a 3-unit eero system over Thanksgiving and it's been a godsend.    These networks aren't so much hubs as layer 2 switches. Know how your phone jumps from one station to another as you move through the house? How it's automatic and quick, but sometimes totally breaks the connection and makes Netflix stutter or VOIP calls drop? eero totally ends that. Connections are rock solid even as they bounce from one router to another. And they do bounce. If my kid and I are sitting on the couch using our phones, and both of us start streaming videos, eero is smart enough to push one of us off onto a different router so we're not interfering with each other's connection.    I would not willingly go back to a handbuilt network now. I've only had a mesh network for a month and a half, but it's so much better than anything I'd pieced together myself that I'm retiring from the practice. ",
"David Leiva","July 25, 2016 ",5.0,"Worked fine for about three weeks and then just stopped. Nothing had changed on my end or my ISP end and just stopped. I have fiber into my house so took the Eero off and plugged into a laptop and got an IP , so I knew I had internet. Called them and then noticed now one of the boxes showed as out with a red symbol. Rebooted and nothing happened. Called tech support and they walked me through some things. Had me reset the box using the button on the back and the button wasn't there. The paper clip just was able to go into the device. Gave me an RMA number and figured I would just use the one in the meantime. Went out for a while and when I came back again no internet. Pulled the remaining Eero off and connected directly and had internet. Tried rebooting and nothing. Called tech support again. Walked me through a bunch of things including wiping out and redoing my network. The Eero was never able to connect. Told him to forget the RMA and I just returned the whole thing. Put a TIme Capsule on the network to use as a router it worked fine. ",

Jonathan,"January 7, 2017 ",1.0,"I love the eero system.  I set one up for myself and one at my sister's house.  It took less than 10 minutes to get all the units up and running at my sister's house.  And the speed, I can't say enough good things about that.  We had slow sketchy coverage before, even with a range extender.  I couldn't believe how easy this was.  Amazing.  I did have some trouble at my home but it had nothing to do with the eeros.  They found everything on my network. I just had some trouble with my other devices but all is good and I'm continuously pleased with the system. I highly recommend the eero Home WiFi System. ",

mary,"December 8, 2016 ",5.0,"We have an old house with concrete block interior walls and we are not able to run any new cable of any sort. I tried moving our router, adding a booster, adding a directional antenna, and could not get reliable signal in our bedroom or basement.

"Paulo E. Reichert","November 27, 2016 ",5.0,"Update 12/3/16 (removed 2 stars): I have a strange problem with eero where virtual machines running on Hyper-V on my laptop struggle to get IP settings from the network's DHCP server. It works about 40% of the time but the other 60% of the time it will either not get any settings or the DHCP server will give it the same IP address as the host machine, causing a network clash.    Their technical support seems to be unable to diagnose the problem and not knowledgeable enough (one person asked me what are virtual machines). Diagnostic tools are unavailable to the client so I can't do any investigation myself and after 3 weeks trying to resolve this I'm starting to think that it ain't going to happen. I'm getting ready to return this item as soon as I can locate someone that has Google Wifi in stock.    Original review:  This is a step into the future of home networks.    When we moved into our house, an average two-storey family house, I put a Comcast Xfinity Gateway router in the front room next to the cable outlet and the wireless connection to it was shockingly bad. It was really only usable within the same room. I tried other solutions to extend the network but always ended up with two SSIDs that we had to switch over and dark spots where there was no signal.    The eero fixed it. 3 boxes spread around my house and now I have strong, fast WIFI everywhere. No dark spots.    The setup was super easy, all done via the phone app. Within minutes I had the first box set up with the network created and adding the extra boxes was super quick. No hitches or issues.    And now I have the peace of mind that if I move to a bigger house or get a dark spot anywhere I can just buy an extra box and throw it in the system and boom, problem solved. I have only one SSID and can seamlessly use the internet walking from room to room. ",

Ben,"December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"The good:  Eero does exactly what it says it does in my experience. Setup once my modem was ready to go took about 5 minutes. Access points were easy to add and the process was very simple (my grandma could do it on her own simple). The system complete covers my house in strong wifi (I even get signal across the street). My download speeds have improved by 60% since installing and I'm now receiving the speeds I'm paying for. The access points have already installed an update all on their own. I'm confident that this system will be more of a set it and forget it system unlike my previous routers.    The bad:  The price is SO expensive. I'm really hoping the engineering is quality and I won't be replacing pieces 2 years down the road like other routers. The single status LED cannot be turned off; keep that in mind if you're placing one in a bedroom.    The ugly:  Eero is a beautiful product.

"Amazon Customer","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I live in a long, narrow apartment with my modem at one end, and my old router didn't have the power to reach to the far end of my home.

The signal has been strong and consistent everywhere, and the units themselves are very small and stylishly subdued, with none of the crazy antennae or blinkenlights of other routers. Adding the additional units involved little more than plugging them in and pressing a button on the app.    The smartphone app is excellent and very well designed. The at-a-glance information when the app first starts (network status, up/down speeds, number of connected devices) is very concise and useful, and quick access to the names and IP addresses of everything on the network has really simplified setting up other wifi enabled devices around my home.

"jenny whyte oliver","June 10, 2016 ",5.0,"I have been fighting internet issues for quite a few years. During those years I have purchased newer and better routers/modems and added two different (dLink and Linksys) extenders, all of which still had trouble in my house (my house, is very tight and doesn't allow the wireless internet to get all over my house). Because of all of those problems I was forced to add another router in my house, which is called a roommate router, because you are only allowed one router in each house, go figure. Anyway, it costs an additional $50 a month. Good news, it has helped. Anyway, as a last resort, I have purchased a new internet booster system called Eero. Very easy to install. So far, so good. I have a system of three, one of which is connected to the router, and two others placed around the house. By far, these extenders have worked further from the router than any other kind of router I have purchased before!!!! I am going to use everything for a month, or so, then turn off my roommate router to see how everything works. Maybe I will be able to eliminate the roommate router and still have internet throughout my house. I will keep you posted. btw the reason I think this system works better is because it connects directly into your router which then boosts the signal throughout the house. ",

Allen,"February 24, 2017 ",5.0,"3 star review because the price doesn't justify the value. If it was cheaper I would probably give it 5 stars but I expect top hardware when paying $500 (3 pack, comes to $166 per router which can buy a premium router with better range).  It uses 2x2 MIMO when 3x3 (communicate on 3 streams) is the standard for top routers (and laptops). It sacrifices some hardware power in order to look good and be relatively small.  Eero is the best looking router, comes in a package like an Apple Product. A lot of attention to detail, simplicity, and aesthetics. Just like an Apple product it costs more than it's competition. It is very easy to set up however the app could have more features. It's perfect for a novice or clueless tech person with a good paying job. Nothing to think about and can easily add/manage a guest network.    I have no problems with the network dropping off and I am a heavy user. The bottom of my Eero is very hot. No visible vents, I am hope no over-heating issues occur because I am cheap when it comes to air conditioning my home.    My house has ethernet in most rooms, my Eero's are connected together via ethernet (through a gigabit switch). So they talk to each other through ethernet with my set up so I get fast speeds on each floor of my house.  I thought Eero's software would just make my life simple and I liked the idea of being able to control and monitor my network on an app but the app just focuses on simplicity and not features like showing how much data each device uses and other advanced stuff.    If a new version came out that was 3x3 and perhaps physically bigger to allow for better internal antennas (improve range) then I would truly be excited about this product. For me it was just a waste of money.  I could have bought a router and additional wireless access point to solve the problem in my home and saved $300. ",

We get 90-100 Mbps download speeds from the attic to the basement (with two floors in between).

I placed two Eeros downstairs within 40 ft of each other (one in the office and one in the living room) and the other upstairs (this one was also approximately 40 ft of both in a straight line). No matter where I placed the 3rd Eero upstairs, the reception was too poor and setup could not be completed.    Setup with the app was super easy and I was looking forward to not having to switch between extenders when moving from one floor to the next.

The setup was very simple, with an iPhone app guiding us step-by-step through placement and configuration.    However, I can't say that the setup was truly easy, since the first eero that we configured would not complete the registration process. We were able to switch it out for another of the three units, which worked fine, and the third unit set up fine as an extended. That first device, still, would not complete the configuration. We called the support number for eero and received an immediate answer. We were guided through several troubleshooting steps, but ended up having to have the unit replaced. A replacement was sent quickly and worked great. If it weren't for their phenomenal service, this review would have been much more critical, but I still am frustrated by receiving a defective unit when purchasing such a pricey product.    After configuration, we have a great signal throughout our house, and plugging our Xbox directly into the ethernet port on one of the secondary nodes has improved its performance by eliminating one wireless step. Speeds have been great, especially as we watch more TV through the internet on AppleTV and Fire TV devices.    Outside of my own personal experience, one of the major hesitations that still concerns me is eero's reliance on connectivity to eero's servers for setup and configuration. With such a new product, I would be devastated to see eero run into financial trouble and end up with hundreds of dollars of paperweights. ",
"Jeff T.","July 28, 2016 ",2.0,"We received RAVED REVIEWS abt the EERO HOME WIFI SYSTEM which inspired me to make this purchased.  Came highly recommended.  After delivery + installation I must wholeheartedly agree!  Vastly improved stable connectivity and the quality.  Radically improved our net experience from working, surfing to streaming!!!  The only downside was the price ... nearly $500.  Work from home folks MUST HAVE RELIABLE CONNECTIVITY meaning this is not a luxury purchase but its essential.  Will be a 5 STAR purchase once price drops to $300.  BELOW AVERAGE VALUE. ",

I had been having issues with poor and dropping wireless upstairs, on the deck behind my home, in the basement, and in the 1st floor areas furthest from my office with that router.  The eero solved all those issues and I have reliable wireless everywhere. I've had it for about 2 months, and never had to restart it or touch it - it's just worked. Setup was simple with the IOS app and took me about 20 mins from opening the box.  My experience has been first rate. ",

"Dee Sooner","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I have a 932 sq foot home with only one person using, so I purchased a single Eero, per the recommendation on Eero's website and reviews on Amazon.  My internet speed increase and reliability has been, in a word, &#34;meh.&#34;  My Eero speed tests consistently report at least 5-8Mbps faster than my three other third-party tests report (Simple Speed, SpeedSpot, AT&T speed test), so I'm not sure what is true.  I have the following devices connected: Macbook, iPhone, Ring doorbell, Sonos, HP printer, Roku.  I have CenturyLink 20Mbps download internet access, which is probably average for people in my income range, neighborhood and usage.  I'm not sure a modest performance improvement was worth $200; while I haven't tested it, I may achieve just as much or more improvement upgrading to CenturyLink 40Mbps download.  I'm sure it is a fantastic device if one has a 2,000+ sq ft home with 2 stories and uses 2-3 Eeros; I have friends who love it.  But I have not experienced a material improvement for a smallish one-story home.    In researching the Eero website, blog and support board, even a single Eero is claimed to outperform a home router, though Eero is certainly designed to work best as a system. Performance includes more than just speed - also includes buffering, reliability and reach. Overall, I saw only a small increase in overall performance of my home network with one Eero. Bottom line: if you have a home &#60;1,000 sq feet, a cord-cutter who streams everything, and have only modest disposable income, you are not Eero's target market. Frankly, I'm not sure why Eero even encourages anyone to purchase just one Eero, as clearly it works best as a system of at least 2-3 Eeros to reach all areas of a bigger home. It is disappointing that Eero's customer support is blaming the customer - me - for my simply not understanding.  I will be returning. ",

"Chris Goffinet","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I really wanted to like this. I had high hopes considering this is a generation one product. I am quite knowledgable in networking than the average person. Before buying this I was aware that the firmware shipping was 1.0, and I needed to let it update to latest before really testing this out. I decided that when I bought this, I would give it a week and see if the high cost was worth it. (I was really unhappy that I couldn't force a firmware upgrade, a detail that really needs to be addressed or at very least you update immediately when powering on the unit...) After about 24 hours, I made sure all units got upgraded to 1.1 firmware. The second day my Apple TV upstairs somehow lost its IP from DHCP and would not let me reconnect. It was working fine and overnight AFTER the 1.1 firmware updated and the units power cycled, it just stopped working. So I power cycled the closest unit to Apple TV, and it finally could pull an IP. Since then it worked pretty good for next 4 days, I enjoyed the range it provided but I noticed that the speeds I was getting weren't exactly going in the right direction. I have a 250 mbps internet connection and upstairs I seemed to get anywhere from 100-120. Not horrible, but my Linksys router I had before eero was able to get me closer to 200. I've noticed every once awhile I would see minor dips in connection speeds to my living room (Netflix or Hulu would just stop playing or pause for a second) every once in awhile. It wasn't horrible but for the $499 price, I was expecting better since this needed to beat my $200 linksys router I had before (I never had these pauses on the linksys in the living room). The last straw was now, my connected computer directly to the eero master just stopped working. I checked and it lost its IP over DHCP and it wouldn't work until I powered cycled that. I might try on v2 or v3 of the product but I just don't think its worth the cost when I seem to be having worse issues with this over my linksys ",

"eero support","December 23, 2016 ",3.0,"I bought this for myself after having successfully deployed 2 other eero 3 pack systems. For those installations I used a powerline adapter to attach the main eero and the most remote eero with the thinking that a &#34;wired backhaul&#34; was more stable/reliable than the wireless mesh backhaul and could provide better communication to the non-wired eero. I also let the main eeros in those setups &#34;be in charge&#34; and handle routing etc (the default/preferred setup).    For my setup which a little more complex as I have a dedicated firewall computer and several subnets. I initially tried to use the main eero in &#34;bridge&#34; mode. This proved to be somewhat unreliable. Was getting dropoffs and network lags. Support reported that there is currently a bug with bridging for some people and that it would be addressed in an upcoming patch. I did not want to wait so switched over the main eero to &#34;automatic&#34; instead of bridged and put it &#34;in front of&#34; my home subnet - a double NAT configuration. For the other two eeros - one was connected via powerline to the home subnet and the other was via the mesh (wireless backhaul).    Things seem to be working a lot better so far. I did have to do some tricky port routing etc for things like my slingboxes thanks to the double NAT setup but really it wasn't that bad. As a bonus I have a bit more wireless and network control features available to me - profiles etc and that's nice.    I'm happy so far - support has been great, product seems to work as expected but still a little early in the game. An old nexus 7 device did initially have some connection issues with the new setup but that seems to have gone away as of this morning.    I am looking at adding another eero to round out my setup - primary one in the basement, 2 on the main floor (either side of the house one wired other powerline wired) and 1 upstairs (wireless mesh).

"David A. Becerril","January 30, 2017 ",5.0,"I purchased an Eero 3 pack in hopes of improving the Wi-Fi situation of my home. I had recently bought a Ring Wi-Fi doorbell, and the signal at my front door wasn't great, resulting in problems with the video feed from the doorbell. I tried some moving my router, and buying some different extenders and experimenting with what will work best. After some playing around, at best I was still only able to get results that were &#34;ok&#34; at the doorbell, but nothing fantastic.    I've previously heard about the Eero, but at $500 it was going to be a last resort. I bit the bullet and gave them a try, and was awfully disappointed with the results. The setup in theory was supposed to be simple, and I assume it would be simple if you have one of the few smartphones that are compatible with their App, but I didn't. I ended up buying a used Nexus tablet just for this, and spent a few hours just trying to get the Eero app installed and launched. Why couldn't I just use a browser like every other piece of consumer networking equipment ever? Once I finally got the app to launch, I couldn't even configure the Eeros as I lacked a data connection, so I needed to use my neighbor's Wi-Fi just to set things up.    It was smooth sailing after the first unit, the next two pretty much configure themselves. That was about all that went well.    The speeds were absolutely terrible. With my old setup of being connected via Wi-Fi AC to my router I would be able to average a 400 megabit transfer speed from my server, and when connected to my range extender it would still easily do 200 megabit, more than enough for streaming high quality videos. Doing the exact same tests on Eeros, I never saw faster than 20 megabit. Streaming video with a 30-megabit bitrate wouldn't work, as it would be constantly buffering. Countless hours troubleshooting didn't help, the only solution was to plug in my old router and switch over to that when I wanted to watch something.    I also had a weird issue which I could never explain, whenever I shut down my desktop (which was connected by Ethernet directly into my modem, not connected to the Eeros at all), the entire Eero network would go down. The second I fire up the desktop, I'd have Wi-Fi again.    There is next to no configuring the Eero, the options are very stripped down and over simplified. No QoS, can’t use different SSIDs for 2.4 and 5ghz, no way to monitor what device is doing what or how much bandwidth is in use or by what. It is a router for stupid people, not people that want to know what is going on in the world.    The coverage the Eeros provide is fantastic, it blanketed my house. While I didn’t have any dead spots before, coverage was significantly improved upon. Unfortunately, that coverage didn’t mean much, as the performance was terrible.  Back to my original issue with the doorbell, the Eero didn’t help. I had great signal near the doorbell now, but due to the performance issues of the Eeros, video quality still suffered and frequently dropped out entirely. I eventually resolved the issue by disconnecting the Eero’s, and using a Netgear power line networking based Wi-Fi extender. Now the doorbell streams high quality video without issue, at about a tenth of the price of the Eero system.    There is a saying that you get what you pay for, this is one of the few times that it doesn't apply ",

I had to move it closer to the first unit, then it could connect.  Upstairs, it could not connect at all, since there was no line of sight, even although it was connected via Ethernet. I measured the downstairs connectivity of the 2 units and the network seemed slightly stronger than my Apple-based router/extender (hence the second star), but i will have to return the package, since I cannot get the third unit to work.  Based on the schematics on eero's site, I assume I would need 5-6 units to get my two-story 2,000 sqft home to work, and it's just not worth the investment.

"Mike S","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"---- Edit 2/20/2017 ----  I will say eero Customer Service has been awesome.  But, after two replacement eeros I am still  having problems as outlined below.  I am at the point, I have disconnected the closest node to my laptop so I only connect to the gateway node to minimize drops.  I still have drops on the gateway node (via ping test described below) but not as frequent, though they seem to occur at bad times (e.g., watching a vid or playing a game).  Not sure what to do next.    Also, today, I have and issue where the eero iPhone app displays that there is a internet connectivity issue and the Gateway eero is offline.  YET, I can still connect to the internet through the laptop and other devices [scratches head].  CS told me to reboot the eeros AGAIN to see if it fixes the problem  At this point, I am afraid to touch anything when things are working so I told them I would wait till there is a problem (I run a significant internet based home business) or I can afford to be down.    I am still hoping things get worked out and stabilized a little more, but will probably picking up a backup router just in case. I will update this review again as things progress.    ----- Original Review ----  Be careful if you game or periodic dropped connections will cause problems.  I have 3 of these and all of them are on one floor within 50' of each other.  After installing, I started constantly seeing internet lag and dropped connections.  My son, playing games, kept getting booted out of games because of the dropped connections.    So, I decided to do a little Ping test.  The eero that was connected to the cable modem was x.x.x.1, and the eero that was in the family room was x.x.x.27.  My laptop was wireless connected to x.x.x.27.  By nature of the mesh network, my laptop path to the internet should simplistically be:    Laptop ==&#62; x.x.x.27 ==&#62; x.x.x.1 ==&#62; Cable Modem ==&#62; Internet    To monitor the connection I opened a 3 DOS Command windows, with each window running one of the following ping commands:    1) ping -t x.x.x.1  2) ping -t x.x.x.27  3) ping -t 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS Server [internet])    The -t option keeps the ping test running constantly so I could monitor the connections.  It turns out the ping to x.x.x.27 stayed pretty steady, while the ping to x.x.x.1 kept timing out.  This led me to believe that the connectivity between x.x.x.27 and x.x.x.1 was the problem.  So I disconnected power from x.x.x.27 which forced my laptop to connecto to x.x.x.1... GUESS WHAT?    The problem went away!    I plugged the family room eero back in and the problem returned.  I switched eeros with the third (by the entry way) and the problem still existed.  I factory reset the eero and re-added back to the network and the problem still exists.    So this leads me to believe there is a problem with their mesh implementation and/or possible interference rejection between the nodes.    I NEVER had a dropped connection with my previous Linksys router. The only reason I replaced it was because I dropped it while rearranging the office and broke off the anntennae. I have some pretty good experience working with secure mesh networks and understand the benefits so I thought  I would give this commercial technology a try...    ...IMHO, they will get there, but there is still several bugs and performance issues to be worked out.    Note:  Hopefully I explained the above simply enough for others to try the test and see what performance you are getting.  You can find the IP addresses to use in the eero app by clicking on nodes at the bottom of the My Network page.  Click the number next to Number of Devices on that page to get a list of all the devices connected to the network, look for the computer you are running the ping test on to see what eero your compter is connected to.

It's a piece of cake to set up and I've had no issues so far in roughly 2 weeks of usage. I've turned off the wifi radios on my FiOS router, Airport Extreme and unplugged the range extenders.    They still have some work to do (mostly for those who have very complex setups), but I'm very impressed with what they have accomplished.    The highest praise I can give it, is that it just works.

Apple also recently announced that they're getting out of the Wi-Fi business so I started looking for an alternative.    The eero mesh network is something that Steve Jobs and Johnny Ives could have made!  Each unit is beautifully self-contained and attractive.  Looks are important!  I have four of them in my house. Where I would have a network problem every other day with my Apple equipment I've had none since installing the eeros more than a month ago.    Set up is done via the eero app on my iPhone. The app is elegant and super user friendly. I enjoy checking in on my network remotely from work! Updates happen automatically in the background.    I didn't worry too much about the cost since I'm going to have these and enjoy them for several years.  You get what you pay for.  It's the same reason I buy Apple products.    I can't think of too many negatives. Would be awesome if they also came in black!  Perhaps one of them could come with a few more ethernet ports. All I did was buy a dumb five port ethernet box and I was able to plug and my Apple TV, etc.    I've already recommended these to my family and friends. Easily the best purchase I made last year! ",

One eero in the basement, one at one end of the house in the living room, one in the middle of the house.    WiFi coverage is phenomenal, anywhere in the house, and even works well in both front/back yards, driveway, and garage. iOS app is very intuitive, and provides ability to change all required settings (including what I'll call 'parental controls' for device-specific access), to more obscure settings like port forwarding and DNS.    I'm personally wary of server-side software that has access to, or controls electronics in my life that previously were without (thermostats, smoke detectors, routers, etc.), but feel better that even if eero goes under, the routers will still continue to function.    Recommended purchase if you can manage the price. Let's hope that cash keeps the company chugging along. ",
JDN,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Really works. Very much worth it. Solves coverage around the house. No more noticing slow response then manually having to select the closest wifi or extender.

Over the years we've experimented with different consumer-grade access points (Linksys, Asus, TP-Link, etc) and always had the same issue.  If you sat close to the AP you had excellent service.  As soon as you got a good 20-30 feet from the unit it all went downhill.  We're in a highly congested building in NYC so there's a ton of channel contention.  We considered business-class mesh hardware/software from all of the major manufacturers; Ubiquity, Ruckus, etc.  Unfortunately the pricing and learning curve was going to be substantially more than we were willing to invest.  After much debate we decided to buy six eero units and place them throughout the office in bridge mode.  We couldn't be happier!!!  Setup was unbelievably easy and the system is very reliable.  We regularly have anywhere between 50 to 70 devices (combination of Nest cameras, tablets, phones, and laptops) connected to the system and performance/throughput is solid.    We get it, these aren't necessarily meant for business use but quite honestly, if you're a small business and don't want to hire an engineer to install and maintain expensive hardware this may work for you.

It automatically downloads software updates in the background (3 updates since I installed the system in late March). I have never had a bandwidth problem since I installed. No more rebooting the router to restore bandwidth degraded over time.    If you are the type that likes to login to your router and twiddle all the settings, this system may not be for you.

"eero support","March 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I live in a brownstone condo in downtown Boston.  A crowded area with a lot of competition for bandwidth, channels and frequencies.  My Apple Router worked ok when in range but couldn't reach the 2nd floor.  An additional Apple Airport Extreme as an extender worked ok not great.  Hence my search for the Eero.  Given the overcrowded competition for 2.4 ghz in my neighborhood I configured a 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wireless network on the Apple router and was able to choose which of the two networks I could join in my condo based on signal strength.  The 5 ghz network FAR outperformed the 2.4 ghz at speeds over 100 mps download for the 5 vs 10 mps or less on the 2.4 ghz network.    While the setup of the Eero was easy, there is NO option to configure both a 2.4 and 5 ghz network  The router simultaneously broadcasts both and chooses for you which network, based on signal strength it connects to.  I want the ability to override the automatic connection and force a connection to the 5 ghz Eero network given the speed advantages.  Unfortunately you can't do that. I called Eero tech support and they are aware of the limitation with no commitment to fix.    While I love the improved signal strength of the Eero mesh throughout my condo, my inability to choose connection to a 5 ghz network (and therefore suffer much slower speeds) is a major drawback.    Net, if you depend or strongly prefer 5 ghz wireless networks - you will not be able to choose this as default option on Eero. ",

And didn't indicate they would or planned to do so in the future.  Make sure you beef up your passwords.    2.  It looks like the system can go anywhere and you are covered.  But during setup, the instructions are the units shouldn't be more 40 ft apart and they work best if they are in line of sight.  I couldn't do that and it seems to be working.

A three pack from Eero fixed us up, and the setup took only a few minutes.  The setup is guided by the smartphone app, which worked flawlessly.  First, you unplug your router and disconnect whatever you've been using for wi-fi.  Then you run an ethernet cable from your router to the first Eero, turn on the power, and follow the very simple directions in the app.  Very soon you are registered, you name the network and the password, and Eero no. 1 is pumping out signal.  Then I went up to the kitchen, on the second level, and powered up No. 2 there.  You then bring it to life with the app, again following VERY simple instructions.  Then I went up to the fourth level and plugged in the final one, again following the app's instructions.

I talked to customer support regarding an issue (turned out that the issue was my doing!) and they were incredibly helpful and supportive.    I'd buy one again in a heartbeat.

wenzels5,"September 11, 2016 ",2.0,"Light years ahead of having a home router and extenders. I have tried many different solutions and this solution is hands down the best I have found for my home. No dead spots, great service in all parts of all three floors.  Yes I had to have five units to cover everywhere but it was well worth it and much better than using range extenders.  It's like crack, I can't get enough of it! ",
"Robert Huntsinger","January 25, 2017 ",5.0,"Easy set up. It def increased my wifi speed and reach throughout my house. Good to have control over individual (children) devices; like setting a time, when kids come home from school, to do homework and to sty offline. This was worth every penny. ",
"Andrew R.","November 30, 2016 ",5.0,"I don't normally post reviews, but having setup many a wifi router and less than stellar performance (Airports, top of the line Asus, etc.) I can easily say setting up the Eero system was BY FAR the easiest and the performance is BY FAR the best - no more dead-zones and plenty of thru-put.  If there were more than 5-stars, Eero would get it (great customer support as well)! ",
J.R.,"November 17, 2016 ",5.0,"Easy to set up.  Had one issue that was handled within 1 minute by calling their spectacular customer service.  I love the auto-switching from 2.4 Ghz to 5.0 or 5.2 Ghz for the fastest connection.  Speed went from about 50 Mbs to 150 Mbs (what I'm actually paying for with my cable provider). Highly recommend.

"B. Robinson","April 20, 2016 ",5.0,"Easy to setup and use! I had a question about placing them and called technical support. They were amazing answered my questions quickly and thoroughly. You can monitor your network remotely from their app and see where any issues in the network are. It covers my whole home without any issues!

Mack,"February 17, 2017 ",5.0,"Worked well with 5 units spread through my 5000 sq ft house. Does not project to the immediate exterior. No more complaints from my kids or wife. Simple to set up. Good speed - 169 down, 12 up - seems to be enough for us. No deterioration with 11 devices active. So much easier than the other options I've tried that didn't really work. ",

mcdtc,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"WOW! Easy setup,simple and fast. I had little success with a high end router maintaining a signal in the kitchen (375 sq. ft.), a long way to the router. Tried a highly recommended signal booster and still lost access or had very slow speeds. We were always trying to reconnect with the router and would at times give up for the day.  With the Eero I had lightning fast speeds, 62mbps. Same problem upstairs until Eero installed. Everyone now happy and off of my case, it feels good not to be blamed for poor connectivity. I recommend the Eero system for anyone wishing to overcome the problems with the myriad of poor signal related issues. Remembering how many steps it took to set up a secure router in the past I called Eero customer service thinking I had missed several important steps. I connected with a real person in less than a minute and he walked me through the set up and explained Eero security. very happy with all aspects of this fine product, buy it with confidence that  your connectivity problems will be a thing of the past.

JT,"November 30, 2016 ",5.0,"In reading other reviews, I was undecided whether to give Eero a shot. I finally made the costly plunge, but let me say, it's worth every dollar!!! Don't let its small size fool you, there's serious horsepower in each Eero. After installing the 3 pack, which was a breeze, I know have full wifi all over my house.  No more signal degradation!!! And most importantly I getting the speed I pay for. Couldn't ask for more. ",
"Steven Milbrandt","February 2, 2017 ",5.0,"If you want consistent  WiFi with no dead spots  get the eero Wifi system.    The one issue I had with the eero was the steep $499 price tag.That being set the setup as easy and my Wifi signal has improved, is more even and consistent.  I see more even WiFi throughout the whole house.  The product delivers exactly what it says.  I was pleased and you will be too. ",
"Y. Leventhal","August 15, 2016 ",5.0,"Got the eero's this afternoon. It took me no time to set up. Unplugged my Apple Time Machine, plugged in one of the eeros, started up the eero app on my phone--viola! Everything started to work. I tested the wireless speed at various places in the house before and after eeros: In most of the areas the speed increased 2x, just like that! In a couple of &#34;dead&#34; zones, the speed went up 3x (to where the speed was right by the Time Machine). Like one reviewer said, the laws of physics still apply: In the farthest corner of the house (including one of the &#34;dead&#34; zones), the speed is only ½ of the speed in the other areas of the house, but totally usable now (unlike before eero). My Apple TV used to be connected by a cable (the wifi was too slow). I connected the Apple TV via the wireless just to see if that works--the connection was FAST.    One eero is in a room separated from the rest of the house by a set of heavy duty sliding glass doors. The other one is about 30+ feet away, equal distance from one end of the house to the other (where the other eero is). I am pretty certain 2 eeros are sufficient, but if not, I can add another one.    It took me a while to make up my mind to ditch the Apple router and extenders. I loved my Apple products, but the wifi just never fast enough even for basic web browser. I switched the network from hidden to not hidden, added extenders, tweaked the modem settings (to the extent I could find instructions), nothing helped. I paid extra for faster speed--didn't make a dent. Before buying the eeros, I agonized over what to do with my 3-year old Apple Time Machine. Well, once I saw how fast the wifi was with eeros, no more worries. I will still use the Time Machine for backup, but that's it.    I am not sure what makes the wifi gain 2x the speed with eeros (am not referring to the &#34;mesh&#34; effect either), but the speed gain plus the mesh (aka blanketing) effect really makes a difference with tricky situations. So far I am very very happy. ",
"Greg W","April 21, 2016 ",5.0,"In a word; amazing. We rely HEAVILY on WiFi in our corporate offices. We need to support private and guest nets and we need to support both 2.4 and 5.0 devices. The Guest segment must be isolated from the private side as well as each other. To accomplish this, we previously had a complex router configuration and FOUR WAPs running. The biggest problem (aside from the tedious maintenance and delicate config) was the varying signal strength (and speed/reliability) in different parts pf the office. Sure, Cisco and others will happily sell us $3000+ in gizmos to handle this.  I was VERY skeptical about a $499 &#34;homeowner&#34; product doing the job. But, it was up and running (in Bridge mode) in &#60; 60 minutes. Everything works as expected and hoped. We left the old stuff running for more than a week as a safety rollback but never needed it. Back to my one word; Amazing. One small black mark irritation... the two mobile apps are not created equal - IOS allows more capabilities - such as check-boxing Bridge Mode - not cool in this marketplace. Hey eero folks, stay up late the next few night and get them on equal footing! ",
HBSURFDOC,"February 15, 2017 ",5.0,"It's as easy to set up and amazing as advertised. I've had a dead zone in my house that I couldn't resolve with any other wifi extender and it worked with the eero. Worth the price. ",
Springer,"March 7, 2016 ",5.0,"Background // We have had this product since late February. We purchased it because we moved into a 1960s single story ranch house; i.e. a house that has a long, horizontal living space with rock solid bones (thick plaster walls over a solid wood frame) meaning wifi signal(s) have to travel long spans through thick walls to reach &#34;connected&#34; devices. Well that quickly proved to be a nightmare for standard single router wifi. Enter eero and its promise of whole home connectivity without any degradation in speed. It sounded magical... like when you find a $20 bill in the pocket of a jacket you hadn't worn since last winter. Gosh that's a good feeling. But I digress. You get where I am going with this. The promise of a product the ends spotty wifi?!?!? Heck ya! Even if it seemed to good to be true, we had to take the plunge. And take the plunge we did. We bought the eero 3pk. Below is a recap of our experience thus far:    Setup // Everything started off simply enough. We got the app installed and the first eero online. I thought to myself, &#34;well this is gonna be a breeze.&#34; To quote Julia Roberts from Pretty Woman, &#34;Big mistake. HUGE!&#34; Famous last words, indeed. A breeze it was not. Was it as hard as say, performing brain surgery (which I can only assume is difficult)? No. But was it as effortless as say making a PB & J sammich (which we all know is easy and to that point a lot of connected products been able to achieve PB & J ease of execution -- Dropcam comes to top of mind as an example)? Nope. Sure wasn't. The second eero I tried to install couldn't be found even though it was placed well within the specified range. And, then I happened to read the directions a bit more closely... &#34;eeros work best when they can see each other.&#34; Well that seems a bit inconvenient for a &#34;whole home&#34; wifi system considering there are walls and corners and furniture in the way in most homes (I can't even imagine how frustrating this would be if we had multiple floors in our home). And isn't it a little bit narcissistic of the eeros themselves that they just want to look at themselves longingly all day, every day? That's a post for another day I suppose. Anyhow, back to the review, once I got the eeros to see each other from across the room(s) set-up worked reasonably well enough from that point on and I was up and running.    Performance // It's been an up and down experience; a bit of a love / hate relationship so far. Some days I love eero. Some days I hate eero. The days I love it -- it does have pretty good whole home coverage for the most part. I can move from room to room and even be outside and still get a wifi signal without having to change networks. That part does work pretty seamlessly. I like being able to see how many devices are online at any given time and the addition of profiles was a nice enhancement to the system. That's kind of where our love ends for eero. So what is it that drives me banana sandwich about eero? Well for starters, it's super finnicky. Move it even half an inch and it stops working. The glowing white light turns a deathly red. Then no matter what room you're in and even if it's not the closest eero to give you the stink eye (i.e. red light of death) it totally messes with your connectivity and out the door goes wireless fidelity. No more Sonos. No more streaming Netflix. No more nothing.  And then comes the whole wifi speed thing... total made-up hoo-ha. Not even close to accurate. Not even close. Ever. This system absolutely does not deliver on its promise to deliver &#34;hyper-fast&#34; wifi across the mesh network. At first I was super pumped to see 100+mbps download speeds from the eero. I began to think of all of the things I could do at once on the Interwebs. So many things, so little time. To say I was giddy like a school girl would be the understatement of the year. Nay the decade. But alas, it was all too good to be true. I opened up some independent speed test apps to see if the speeds jived with what eero was reporting. No way Jose. The independent apps reported that my download speeds were only like 20mbps or 30mbps. That's a far cry from the 100+mbps eero consistently reported. The only time I ever came within 20mbps of what the eero app was reporting was when I was standing directly next to the eero that was hooked up to my modem (it's worth noting that within is the operative word here because even standing at the source I still wasn't getting the reported download speeds the eero app said I was purportedly getting). Wah! Wah! Wah! Sadness ensues. So yeah, I have no idea what sort of funky computations these guys are doing on the backend but I can tell you unequivocally that the speeds reported via my eero app have been erroneous and inflated on all occasions. The whole speed reporting that eero provides feels like a bunch of malarky. Oh well.    Conclusion // So in the end, eero is like anything in life. It's both good and bad. What it does well it does reasonably so. What it does poorly it does reasonably so, as well. It certainly isn't anywhere near the best thing since sliced bread -- but I guess what is, really? That said, when you market something as being the best thing since sliced bread it should at least be within spitting distance of that goal and sadly to say that ain't the case here. So 3 stars it gets because if I had to give it a one phrase assessment it would be &#34;Meh, it's ok I guess.&#34; ",
"eero Support","May 11, 2016 ",5.0,"I used to have to reset my router almost every day and struggled with dead spots even with a range extender.  Since I deployed my eero system I have had solid service with no interruptions or issues.  Highly recommended. ",
"Mark Goddard","September 15, 2016 ",3.0,"Eero totally saved my home network!  Over the years I've spent many hundreds of dollars replacing routers that I thought were faulty and buying all sort of WiFi extenders.  But nothing would ever solve the problem of my devices constantly dropping their internet connections. Almost every day, I had to renew my DCHP lease on my i-devices, DirecTv and Apple TV.  Frustrating beyond compare. But after reading the reviews about Eero I gave it try. I started out with a single eero and immediately saw the benefits. My wifi was rock solid now. But my NetGear wifi extender was still dropping it's connection, so I ordered a second eero to replace it. That was about two weeks ago and I haven't had to renew my DCHP leases once!  Set up is a no brainer.  I wish I could give eero SIX stars! ",
