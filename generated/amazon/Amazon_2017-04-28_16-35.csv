nycebo,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I've been wanting an Eero for a long time, ever since it was first announced. The idea of having a mesh network just sounded so appealing. By the time that I finally got around to buying one, a couple of competitors had popped up. The most promising of them is the Luma. So, I actually bought both mesh routers and will proceed to review and compare them here (a copy of this review will be posted on both the Luma and the EERO product pages).    DESIGN  The Eero hardware is really awesome. As others have mentioned, it looks like something that Apple would design. Very glossy white and sleek looking. The routers are small squares that lie flat and have power and network cables coming out the back. There's also a USB, presumably for NSCs or printers. Eero also gave extra thought to maximizing radio antenna efficiency: the tops of the routers are modestly rounded to prevent users from putting glasses or other items on top of them (and thus obstructing strong signal).    The Luma hardware is pretty nice also. Actually, the honeycomb is pretty handsome on a bookshelf and I like that it comes in different colors. BUT, and this is a big bug, the Luma is meant to stand on edge. And, when the power and network cables are plugged in, it's unsteady. This doesn't matter too much if your first router is in the fiber closet, but it'll fall over somewhat often out in the open and look the eyesore.    Edge to Eero.    SETUP  I have Verizon FIOS fiber running at my home. Setup was pretty easy as I just plugged one end of a network RJ-45 cable into the ONT and then the other end directly into the &#34;first&#34; router. Luma apparently also allows for ethernet backhaul, but Eero doesn't at present. Regardlees, I don't use that feature so it's not relevent to me. Moreover, I doubt most buyers of this product will use it either. Anyway...    The Luma was set up first. Things went pretty smoothly. I downloaded the app from Android Play store and created an account with username and password. Remember to log into your old router and release the IP address for your ISP. Then I just followed the instructions on the app: powered down the old router, powered down the ONT (aka modem), plugged the network cable into the ONT and the Luma hub, and then plugged them both in. The Luma app on my Google Nexus 6P found the hub immediately, named it and asked me to sit patiently while it registered on the network. Sadly, that never happened. I tried one more time...no go. A quick search online revealed that some Android devices have difficulty. So, I tried setup with my Google Nexus 9 tablet and voila! It registered and I had wireless network. For the next two hubs, I used an old iPhone and things worked very smoothly also. So, perhaps it just didn't like my Nexus 6P. Small bug but no harm done.    The Eero set up was also smooth....after I figured out how to release my IP address on the Luma (see below). Basically, I had to power down the ONT and wait a couple hours. Once I did, setup with my Nexus 6P was quick this time round. Again, I downloaded the Eero app and created an account by entering my telephone number and then entering a 6 digit SMS code. The Eero hub was named, registered and had live internet. Good to go.    I'll call this a tie despite the Nexus 6P hiccup with Luma. But if you have a Nexus 6P and want to use a Luma, be prepared to need to try a different device for setup. If you're a stickler, edge to Eero.    THE APP INTERFACE  Right off the bat, both Eero and Luma apps are sparse. If you're used to configuring a wireless router in the past,  you will be unpleasantly surprised by the absence of desired features, including dynamic DNS, QoS, IP release, etc. However, I recognize that these devices are supposed to be family friendly and that they are. Following the instructions in both apps is super easy and very efficiently and quickly gets the first wifi puck up and running. NOTE: I must emphasize that the Verizon FIOS ONT needs to release the IP address in order to switch routers. If you don't release it, then you need to sit around for 2 hours with it powered down until does so automatically. This shouldn't affect most users who just buy either the Luma or the Eero. But, if you are planning on testing a couple devices, it's wise to remember.    Anyway, at this point, both apps look very similar and clean with their router status view, upload and download speeds and devices attached tab. Furthermore, they let you add new routers to the mesh network easily, name them (although Eero allows for custom names), reserve IP addresses (in advanced settings menus), enable port forwarding, assign wireless devices to a user profile, UPnP, etc. Here's where they differ:    The Eero app allows devices to be nicknamed (a super nice feature), allows for a custom DHCP, and allows DNS config if you want to use Google or OpenDNS or whomever.    The Luma can't do any of those at present. However, it does allow for IGMP Snooping to be enabled or disabled. Luma also offers a rating filter for all or specified users. I don't know what the movie-like ratings mean but it would seem handy if I had young kids to whom I wanted to restrict content.    In the end, they are both pretty similar. If I had to give one an edge, it would be the Eero simply because it allows nicknames for device connections. I dig that.    Minor edge to Eero.    SIGNAL  Okay, a lot of words to get to the part that matters most. How is the signal? Alas, this is really hard to quantify. Basically, I walked around all of the rooms in my home with the Wifi Analyzer app and took readings. On average, the Eero was about 2-5 db better than the Luma in each room. Having read some reviews online, perhaps it has to do with the extra 5Ghz antenna. Who knows? But, it was a pretty minor discrepancy and may have had more to do with how the hubs hand off the connection to one another (or don't) than actually signal strength. I will say this, BOTH Eero and Luma very capably covered all corners and rooms of my home. That alone is a tremendous victory compared to my sad history with range extenders that just never satisfied us at all.    So, minor edge to Eero but very satisfactory marks to both.    THROUGHPUT  After writing the above, a big surprise here. No bones about it but the Luma just clobbered the Eero. I have no explanation for this, especially after Eero's signal advantage. Basically, my devices would connect to the Eero hubs admirably and all looked well, achieving 120% of my Verizon FIOS bandwidth. But, after an hour or so, throughput would just plummet to about 10-30%. Badly. It made me crazy. Browsing was bad. Streaming was very difficult. My wife (who doesn't care about these tests at all) would complain and ask what I was doing to the network. I ensured that I was running the latest version but it didn't seem to resolve anything. I power-cycled everything. No success.    The Luma, on the other hand, functioned well. It would test at 100-120% of my FIOS bandwidth and almost always stay there, even if I ventured to far corners of the apartment. It made streaming on multiple devices, browsing, downloading, and music MUCH nicer than I have ever had in the past. And, the wife didn't complain. All is not rosy though. With some music sources, Luma needs a little attention. Sonos (Pandora and TuneIn Radio) ran into buffering pauses every so often. I'm hopeful that they can resolve this soon.    So, I don't have a good answer for why this was the case...especially since a lot of other users have raved about Eero. Perhaps the signal just doesn't steer my devices to the faster frequency connection. Candidly, even the 2.4GHz shouldn't have an issue. It was just curious.    Edge to Luma. But remember that you might not have this experience and I wasnâ€™t going to waste more than a weekend trying to nail down the issue.    PRICE  Because of the intro pricing for pre-ordering the Luma, it was $250 cheaper for me than the Eero. These devices are already pricey compared to traditional routers so it matters.    Edge to Luma.    FINAL RESULTS  Here's the rub, since Luma cost much less and functioned better, I just ended up keeping it. Yes, the little hexagons aren't as aesthetically pleasing but I can't have complaints about video quality on Netflix and Amazon Prime. Since we don't have cable, HD streaming is very important. So, while others have had good success with Eero, I just can't affirm their experiences. Unless you have extensive streaming requirements or network throughput needs, I think that Luma should suffice nicely. And for the price, it's a no brainer...even if it is only $100 less than the Eero now.    But, and it's a big but: both manufacturers really need to keep stepping it up in development. The apps and features are way too vanilla at present. Good signal and performance will only get you so far with more advanced users.    EERO (3 stars)  LUMA (4 stars) ",
"eero Support","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Fantastic and game changing.  I have a large old brick home that requires internet on three floors.  Here is a list of the wireless routers that I purchased in the last three years and that did not work to provide reliable wireless in our home: (1) Airport Extreme (2) Netgear N900 Wireless Router, (3) Linksys EA9200.  In a failed attempt to make these three different wireless routers work I also added a Netgear range extender and used an Securfi Almond as a wireless range extender.  None of these combinations provided reliable wireless internet throughout our home.  Sometimes everything would work and sometimes some devices would get kicked off the network and could not login without rebooting everything.  The range extenders often did nothing.  Before I purchased eero, I was unplugging and restarting my modem and router at least once a day. Even at its best, I could never reliable get devices to work that required a reliable and strong wireless connection. In particular,  I have 5 Nestcams that would rarely stay connected for a full day. They require a very strong and reliable wireless connection to work.  Also, WiFi calling on my AT&T iPhone does not work unless it has a strong 5ghz wifi connection which I never was able to achieve consistently in my home.  I have approximately 30 different devices connected to our network at any time (5 iPhones, 2 iPads, 2 apples TVs, 1 Roku, 1 iMac, 2 MacBook Air's, 8 Sonos speakers, 5 Nestcams, 1 Peleton bike, 2 printers, 2 backup hard disks etc.) and in order to get all this stuff, I had to hard wire as many of them as possible directly to ethernet because wifi was never reliable enough.    eero has changed everything.  It took less than an hour to set up 3 eero units.  Everything worked on it immediately (Note: you have to restart your modem as instructed and unplug an restart any ethernet switches).  We have wifi in every corner of every floor of our house.  Every Nestcam has worked continuously without fail and I have full wifi calling on my iPhone.  The eero app (which is fantastic) lets me check the status of my network from anywhere and has shown 60mbps of download speed, 5mbps of upload speed and all three eero units online since the moment I plugged them in. My family has never been happier.    ps If anyone wants any of the routers or extenders the eero system replaced, let me know and I will send them to you for free (picture attached).    Update as of June 26, 2016: since the day I set eero up in April, I have never touched it. I have never had to reboot it or restart it. I have never lost internet connectivity for a minute. No other router I have had has worked like this. ",
"Mr. Truth","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Feb 8, 2017 update:  They just released the 2.2.0 firmware update yesterday.  It is supposed to have fixed delays in switching access points when roaming, down to something like 50ms, among other things.  This problem affected people using WiFi calling on Apple devices, where the call might drop if moving about.  Also, I did notice streaming apps would lose connection when the connection dropped.  It does appear to be better, but have yet to extensively test, but support page feedback looks very positive.  They do update firmware every month or two, and actively post on their community and reddit pages.  One positive I want to mention is that streaming performance outside, where I used to have serious issues by the pool, appears to be much better now than with my old (but recent) Apple router, even though the main node is placed in the same room as before (and is closest to the pool).  Looking forward to seeing how well this works this summer.  So while there are cheaper options out there, this does have very good customer support and a much more mature product than something like the Google WiFi.  Also noticed that Wifi signal is unaffected while a microwave oven is on--I was able to stream on my phone while sitting right next to it, which is a pleasant surprise.  One more thing.  Be wary of critical reviews containing outdated info, especially the featured ones here.  Firmware updates move quickly (for the networking space), so you should really go to the Eero community support or reddit pages to get the most current feedback so you don't pass over the product due to negative reviewers who won't update/remove their reviews because they'll lose their up votes.    Original:    This replaced an Airport Extreme and 2 Airport Express extenders. One issue with the old setup is that when moving around the house, devices would stay locked with degraded unusable connections for too long and not switch. Another is that I needed to get streaming to work flawlessly because I am planning to add multiple Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera 2 pack. Once I added a Skybell HD I could see issues because that device gets bogged down an unreliable without a very robust WiFi signal. While moving the Express around helped, I could still see the signal strength fluctuate even when connected to it, just located on the other side of the wall. Also, with one Nest cam streaming continuously, there would be hiccups with that stream when the Skybell was also recording. All these issues seem to have disappeared since installing the Eeros, and now I've ordered another two Nest cams and upgraded the Skybell to use full 1080 video instead of degraded 480 or 720 options.    Installation was very very easy. I mean not a single issue with the Eeros themselves, but I did disable/enable Wifi on two Macs and reboot of a Slingbox 500. I appreciated that they allow you to do configure some advanced networking features, and while there does not appear to be user configurable QoS yet, their web page says there is a basic implementation in place, and that they may offer more capabilities.    Even if you don't buy this mesh networking product, most people would be better off with one over a traditional router because these vendors are actively competing on features and performance with aggressive firmware updates, and the only thing a tradition router will get is a once in a blue moon security update. On that note, I would discourage people from an Orbi, since that appears to be a gussied up Netgear with the latest specs. Once you take a look at the browser configuration interface, it will be very familiar to anyone who has had a Netgear router, devoid of any imagination or cutting edge features or modern interface. No useful info about clients offered. At least for the Eero, I could not find a single review claiming the routers needed periodic rebooting, as we are all accustomed to, even with the Apple products (though better than Dlink or Netgear routers).    Eero is the one recommended by Leo Laporte, as I saw on his feed, though since Eero is a sponsor, objectivity could be compromised. I was seriously thinking about the Amplifi since the router itself is uber cool, but I had issues with the very large satellites and their orientation, as well as a number of reviews suggesting things like poor performance or quality control issues. One thing that sold me about the Eero is their claim that their implementation performs active routing, as you will see on the blog post explaining the TrueMesh technology. So if one node is busy, it can reroute traffic to another, which makes these satellites behave more like routers actually employing an active routing protocol. From speaking with Amplifi tech support, I was not convinced that the roaming functionality would work seamlessly, but I can't speak from first hand experience. While I might buy and try still, so far I'm content with the Eeros.    Let me say that some of the earlier reviews, say pre-Nov 17 2016, do not have the benefit of using the 2.x firmware. I fully expect many reviews addressing performance as a concern are out of date since they don't reflect current reality. My unit shipped with 1.2 firmware, and once I updated to 2.1, the WAN throughput doubled from 55Mbps to 110Mbps, my ISP limit. I may pay another $10 per month to upgrade my ISP speed once I get enough Nest cams to tax my upper limit (11Mbps) on the upload. From the Nest webpage, each cam at 1080p uses 450 Kbps (0.45 Mbps) upload on average, and 1.2Mbps max, so really I should be well under the ISP max with a number of camera streaming. The 802.11ac protocol, used by the Eeros, supports 1.3 Gbps, or 1331 Mbps, so for anyone curious, the protocol between the Eeros should have more than ample room to support numerous 1080 streams, plus a 4K stream with ease.    Upgrading firmware was easy--I just pushed the option in the IOS app to upgrade, and it proceeded to upgrade all three devices. Even those with recent purchases may not have taken the initiative to update the firmware, so that is something to consider when reading reviews since most people don't report what they are using.    I did seriously consider the Google Wifi, but was concerned about the immaturity and lack of any advanced features. It might work for average users, but for instance, from what I read you cannot even specify a preferred subnet. While perhaps that might change with future updates, with the Eero you get a maturing product, versus a very new Google product. The one concern I have with Eero is the high price.  I guess you would want to buy this if you want superior customer support with a lot of attention placed on advancing the product's capabilities.  And probably because it is, at this point, more mature than a number of recent offerings.    One thing that bothered me before purchasing was the lack of line of sight that they recommend. My primary router is in a corner room, and not central in the house, and invariably goes through drywall covered walls. I was researching Power over Ethernet to use a a backhaul to the Eero satellites, but decided to setup and test without POE. So far, I can say I don't see a reason I will ever need to use POE with these existing two satellites. One issue with what I found on POE products offered on amazon is that I would be worried about periodic rebooting and troubleshooting of those devices. So my advice for anyone similarly concerned about line of sight is to try it naked first and figure out a way to place within rooms that minimizes obstructions. Obviously, anyone with Cat 6 interior cabling already installed would want to use that.    Apr 2017 update:    Every few weeks my 2009 iMac goes off Wifi with these eeros and will not reconnect and requires a reboot.  The other Apple products seem OK, so I don't know what is going on, and I haven't had a chance to get support to intervene on this yet.  At this point, that is my only gripe about these. ",
Entrope,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"We have a fairly large home and property where we need wifi in almost every section of the property for everything from Apple TV's to security cameras.  We have literally spent thousands of dollars attempting to make the wifi signal be reliable within our home, on the grounds of the property, and within other structures on the property. Some of the solutions worked (albeit usually temporarily), but the solutions that did work required the services of our computer technician to install and/or fix. That being said, that has grown increasingly expensive as a simple reboot of the system if anything did go hay wire generated a bill from the IT company. In a last ditch effort before hard wiring the entire property, we tried eero.  In less than 30 minutes, we had the entire property up and running on eero WITHOUT THE NEED FOR THE IT COMPANY!!!  We hardly ever write a review, but I felt compelled to do so for this product.  I can't say enough about the quality and SIMPLICITY of the product!!!  Buy it.  You won't regret the decision!!!!! ",
"Andy B.","February 8, 2017 ",5.0,"This system has worked incredibly well.  It is certainly not cheap, but it seems to be a case of getting what you pay for: excellent performance and fast set up.  Setup relies on a simple iPhone app and was super simple.  The network performance has been flawless and fast.  However, two important notes: (1) it takes a couple days for the network to optimize itself, so be patient - mine was pretty fast out of the box, but a friend's eero network (in a taller house) improved by nearly 3X over the course of about 48 hours (2) you have to do the latest software updates for the best performance. Below are the performance numbers for my old Airport Extreme, followed by the eero without a patch and then the eero with the patch. ",
"Occasional Reviewer","August 21, 2016 ",5.0,"I'm am geek without all the knowledge so keep that in mind when you read this review.  I have tried everything to get wifi to reach all part of my house.  My office is in the back so the router would not put off enough signal at 50 feet away to work my iPhone.. randomly came across this product thanks to the geek squad installing my new microwave.. free advice I'll take it.    Do not let the price scare you! The upstairs portion of my house is almost 2000sq feet with a fireplace and wall in the middle. I have 4 eero's set up in 4 part of the house and I absolutely love it    Set up is a breeze with the app and it even tells you if the location you picked will not work. Just to give you an idea on my wifi speed, I was getting 49mb in my car. About 50 feet from the box in the kitchen.  79mbs in certain parts of the house and 30 mb in the basement.    I run kodi on hd, Apple TV, the wife finally loves me again now that she can use her laptop in the living room.    There are cheaper options but I've learned my lesson. Definitely worth the buy ",
"carlton marshall","December 26, 2016 ",5.0,"review 12/17/16    Eero with three access points function at least as well as three separate access points (any brand) on the same SSID.  I wired all three of my eero units to wifi in order to handle the &#34;backhaul&#34;.    The fundamental problem with this setup:  Apple devices such as iphone 6s and the late 2016 macbook pro with touch bar (absolute latest devices available from Apple) do not handoff from one eero to another without dropping connection.  The handoff from access point to access point varies from 1 to 10 seconds depending who knows what.  You WILL DROP VOIP CALLS or IPHONE/IMUSIC/AIRPLAY streams during handoff.  It is NOT ANY different in performance compared to having multiple airport express access points.    If all you want is more broad coverage of wifi, any number of solutions will be feasible. If you want SEAMLESS transition, I would say NOTHING exists that is perfect at this time.    Apple has no way of knowing how many access points you have and it clearly does not scan or actively trade access points until your bandwidth drops into oblivion and you lose connection first.  Even then, the handoff is way too slow to reconnect.    It is possible in addition that the foam insulation in my house is causing more radio reflections and slowing things down even further.  But that makes my point even more important:  the challenging house is where you would want an eero to work... and that's exactly where it won't.    People seem to have reported poor results in other wifi discussions with apple products in terms of handoff between access points.  Unless devices are actively scanning with a second wifi antenna and pre-connecting, you won't get the desired results.  Another option might be if a device was connected to two signals at once.    I am going back to me centrally placed asus router so that I can do Iphone over wifi with AT&T since my cell reception sucks in my house.  I lose some phone coverage at certain corners of my house, but this is something I am going to have to live with.  I suspect nothing important will change in my house until wifi technology moves towards a true mesh network at some point.    SEAMLESS HANDOFF is what we are looking for Eero and Apple.  Eero is falsely advertising until this can be done.  Eero bears responsibility for not warning the average user that their product won't work with all clients.  I am clearly not the average user and so I was able to figure out that this is not going to work no matter how much I screw around with it.    I gave this 3 stars but I should have been much more harsh for wasting half my day on this nonsense.  I am curious how many people who installed an Eero are predominantly just on one AP and therefore are reporting good results.  If someone has any further theories, I am willing to hear them... ",
Kishore,"November 4, 2016 ",5.0,"We tired many different routers, including adding access points or signal boosters and nothing worked. The router is on the 3rd floor of our home. The wi-fi was okay up there but on the second floor where the Xbox and iPads are, it was terrible.    It took 10 minutes to install three eero units, and we were getting 150mbps almost immediately. Throughout the entire house.    The reason I give this review only 4 stars instead of 5, is that it took about 48 hours for the speeds to remain constantly high. We'd go from 150mbps to &#60; 5.  Support suggest constantly power cycling the eero units and my modem, which does help, but I shouldn't have to power cycle so often.    It's been a week and speeds are consistently high. The eero units upgrade their firmware in about 24 hours. Most of the issues you will read on here and other forums are related to the very early release before they updated the firmware.    It's expensive, but it was worth every penny.  Could we have probably found a cheaper and simpler solution, possibly but these are good looking and elegant and just work.  Reminds me of Apple in a way.    I've attached an image from fast.com of our wireless speeds. We pay for 150mbps from Xfinity and as you can see our wireless is faster than what we're even paying for. ",
"Jack Marchetti","December 17, 2016 ",3.0,"Let me start by saying that I normally don't write many reviews on products, nor do I put my name on them.  However, this is one that I will make an exception for.  I absolutely love the eero systems that I have bought.  And just so you know, I went with the 2 pack to get started.    You really can't ask for a more simple setup process.  Simply plug your first eero device into your modem/router and then follow the steps on your mobile app.  Adding a second eero was even easier.    In case this helps you with your decision to by, the current house these 2 devices are covering is around 2500 sq. ft and 2 story.  I have one eero upstairs in the media room and one downstairs in the living room.  These 2 cover the entire house with no issue and I can even get coverage out into the front and back yards.    I've been in IT for many years and appreciate being able to just set eero up and then forget about it.  Occasionally I'll receive an email saying my devices have been updated to improve security and performance.  Thank you for that!  Last thing I want after working a full day is to come home and have to worry about updating firmware on my wireless devices.    If you are a huge techie and want every single wireless or network option/feature to play around with then this may not be the device you are looking for.  But if you are looking for a stable, quality product that does everything it needs and then some, this is a great purchase!  A bit pricey yes, but well worth it in the long run! ",
"Shawn H.","June 15, 2016 ",4.0,"I purchased the 3 pack in July 2016 and I've had absolutely no issues with them whatsoever. I cannot say the same for the&nbsp;NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Dual Band Wi-Fi Gigabit Router (R7000) with Open Source Support. Compatible with Amazon Echo/Alexa&nbsp;that I purchased in January 2015 and its companion, the&nbsp;NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Desktop WiFi Range Extender (EX7000-100NAS)&nbsp;purchased in June 2015. At the time, I thought I was out of my mind spending $400 on the eero Home WiFi System (it would've been $500 at the time, but Amazon offered a promo of $100 off), especially considering the amount of money I had already spent on the Netgear Nighthawk equipment. While the Netgear equipment provided fast throughput, I clearly decided 6 mos after purchasing the router that I needed an extender. Also, by 2016 I was experiencing dropouts all the time to the point that I routinely had to cycle the router nearly every day. I could not for the life of me figure out what was going on w/the Netgear router. I was so frustrated that I simply had to try the eero Home WiFi System. To date, I've had no dropouts; no need to cycle power - the eero simply works and is frustration free. I have one in second floor my home office, one in my upstairs bedroom, and the third in a cabinet (supposedly a no-no re: reception) that house my gaming systems, DVR, etc. There are currently 23 connected devices including 2 desktops, 3 laptops, 2 tablets, 3 cell phones, 4 Sonos speakers, 3 streaming devices, 3 Arlo cameras, 1 Ring doorbell camera (which prompted the purchase of the Netgear Extender), multiple Hue lightbulbs, etc. etc. When needed and in use, everything that is on my network works and works well. I never experience buffering issues when streaming music or TV. Web pages load quickly and multiplayer gaming is lag free. I also have a strong signal in my front and back yard! (I'm using this with Comcast Blast Plus!I also like that they are low profile and simply elegant compared to the beastly size and unattractive look of my old Netgear equipment (currently housed in a drawer until I figure out what to do with them). The only draw back I can think of is that there is only one ethernet port. However, that problem is easily solved through the purchase of an ethernet switching device such as the one I purchased for roughly $10:&nbsp;NETGEAR 5-Port Fast Ethernet 10/100Mbps Switch (FS205).  Oh - and I initially had an issue in which I had a problem getting eero to work with my employer's VPN and customer support was quick, friendly and solved the problem. That was the one and only problem I've had with these. All in all, If you're looking for a hassle free solution to router/WiFi issues and you don't mind that you're not going to be able to tweak various settings like QOS, then the eero system is the way to go. Frankly, I don't miss looking at or tweaking the various settings on Netgear's software - I really don't have a need to with the eero since it works as expected. Which is to say that the eero Home Wifi System exceeded my expectations and was definitely worth the expense in order to achieve hassle free WiFi throughout my home (including the yard, attic and basement). Highly, highly recommended. ",

"J. Mangan","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"My long time network configuration - an Apple Time Capsule with Apple Airport Expresses as network extenders finally had to be &#34;retired&#34; because network performance was becoming inconsistent. It served me well for years; however, I could never get a solid wifi signal throughout my home, nor the performance throughput I was paying for with Comcast.    Got tired of my wife complaining about as the signal degradation the past year. Watch the Eero video on their web site.....it is spot on. I was doing everything the guy in the video was doing. I purchased Eero's products, because I didn't want to deal with a non-consumer friendly, poorly designed, and less than stellar performance networking solution. I did look at competing mesh networking products, but chose Eero for the favorable customer experience.    Set-up was as easy as everyone has written about. Just plug the devices in as instructed, and everything was recognized by their iOS app. Took a few minutes on my devices were all online. I kept my same network name as my old one and the same network password, so all my devices were recognized.    Only task I had to do was update the firmware. The firmware update done via their iOS app and the network worked perfectly after upgrade. The only extra thing I did was assign a unique name to every device on my network. I did not care if I didn't have all the configuration parameters like I did with my Apple set-up, because I never used the overly technical settings to begin with.    I now have 17 unique devices on the network with no reported problems. This includes one Nest thermostat, three Nest smoke alarms, one Apple time machine network drive, two iPads, two iPhones, one Apple TV, one Amazon Fire stick, one Apple iMac, one Apple MacBook Pro, and a five others for good measure. No lags, no offline conditions, etc. It appears to just work.    Observations:    - Easy to install and set-up.  - Eero constantly improving their software and features. Very easy to see how committed they are to making this a best in class product.  - iOS app is straight forward. No bloated app design. They keep it simple and clean. No way to get lost in it.  - App allows you to turn off the device indicator light.  - Covers my two-story home with consistent high throughput wifi coverage.  - Responsive customer service. When one of my devices failed after 48 hrs. I called Eero and got a live person who spoke English...they shipped a replacement device immediately. All I had to do was return the defective device in the package with pre-paid shipping label. Easy.  - Easy online Help information. Again, information is easy to find/search for, well composed, and offers easy to follow instructions.  - Delivers a consistent and available connection across my 2200 foot two story home. Check out the awesome performance I am getting in the picture I posted.    Misc.    - One satellite device failed after 48 hrs, but Eero replaced it immediately (thank you Eero).  - When checking the wifi performance via the iOS app, it is not clear how the network speed results are determined. It would be nice know which device it is testing the network throughput from. When I test with Speedtest.net, I get a totally different network performance number. I don't know why. Maybe another user can enlighten me. I did notice when I check the network speed on multiple devices with the Eero app....they all activate. Interesting, no issue on that, just my curiosity why?  - I wish the devices were smaller in footprint like the Apple Airport Express.    No showstoppers, a positive customer experience, and my wife is happy with her husband again.    Thank you Eero, keep up the good work! ",
"K. Kwan","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I have purchased the 2 units packaging but since most reviews are posted here so I am posting mine here as well. I got this two days ago and it worked great right off the bat, I got pretty good signal in one area my old router was given me problem.  Anyway that did not last, end of day one my wireless printer was not working and somehow I could not even join the network.  I tried restarting the printer several times but the printer just could not find the network at all.  So i tried rebooting my eeros and at the end deleted my entire network and started over over again.  The printer was working but my second eero just refused to be connected to the main one even it was sitting next to each other.  It kept telling me my second eero was out of range in bad placement while they were next to each other.  I tried to restart, and also completely reset the eero by using the reset button at the back, still not working.  At the end i had to switch the main and the slave units and it finally worked again.  Good thing just don't last, the next day i saw my network just disappeared for like a minute and kicked all items off.  At the end I just returned them as I don't think this product is ready for prime time.  Also if you notice there are a lot of positive 5 starts reviews by &#34;NON verified&#34; buyers so you know they are trying to bump up the ratings.  Just my opinion. ",
"eero Support","March 27, 2017 ",5.0,"This new technology is as good an improvement as I could have hoped for.  I have Comcast high speed internet, very fast and I use the latest Apple Airport Extreme for my router.  We have a large house (3700 square feet) and we have many bad spots with poor speed.  For example my Apple Macbook Air in our kitchen sometimes is as slow as 2-5 mbps, while if I put the laptop next to the router (which is upstairs) I can get 100-175 mbps.  I also noticed that Apple has announced they are getting out of the router business--that suggested to me they realize their technology isn't keeping up and perhaps they don't want to invest in this area.  So I bought the 3-pack Eero and set it up, total time probably 20-25 minutes.  I chose to sort of triangulate my house, two units upstairs at each end of the house and one in the kitchen.  Despite the fact that Eero says it may take 24 hours to get up to full speed I am getting 125-175 mbps everywhere---yeehaa!  My Facetime to London was better and my Ring doorbell videos are much better.  One tip for setting it up:  Eero said to plug in the first unit and the modem simultaneously,  but the Comcast modem takes about a minute to connect so the Eero unit seemed to be struggling to connect.  I would suggest plugging in the modem first, let it show all the lights up and running, then plug in the Eero.  One other thought; some online reviews complain about the somewhat higher price of the Eero vs. Google wifi versus Orbi for example.  I think this is a mistake.  Having the best and fastest wifi in one's home is about as important as anything you have running in your house.  I am willing to pay extra for the best solution which this clearly is. ",
"David S.","April 22, 2016 ",3.0,"My family's home is an older home, with thick interior walls made of brick (not just brick faÃ§ade). What's more, it's two stories and it's long. Ever since Wi-Fi came into popular use, we had a single router in a closet at one end of the house â€”Â an old Linksys. Of course, that meant that barely one half of the house had Wi-Fi, but this was still in the days of Wi-Fi extension cards. About five years ago, I scrapped that router and put an Apple Airport Extreme in its place, with an Airport Express in the opposite corner of the house. This worked a lot better, but there was a dreaded dead zone in the middle, which became apparent as we walked through it with our smartphones and our current task slowed to a halt. As soon as I found out about this system, which claims to handle good signal propagation for you (provided you place them at a certain interval with line-of-sight), I was very excited. I bought five for the house, and dotted them throughout, favoring the rooms of family members who had chronically complained about terrible signals and speeds for years. After giving the system a few days to &#34;self-configure,&#34; (eero's secret sauce), everyone had consistently good speeds and reliable signal in every corner of the house, on every device. What's more, we get the speed we're actually paying for with our ISP. Suffice to say I love this product. I don't think the price is that bad when I compare a single unit to an Airport Express, similar in price and size â€” the eero does more than the Express anyways. One caveat to anyone looking at these is the speed drop that you may experience when your device is connected to an eero node that is several hops away from a wired connection. eero has reduced this problem compared to standard repeaters, but the fact is that you lose speed with each hop â€”Â my solution was to hardwire a few eero nodes using Power over Ethernet devices to get ethernet in the middle of the house.

I can't remember a time when we didn't have to literally restart our modem multiple times a day. (Old house - plaster walls, multiple levels etc.)  I had tried everything.  Multiple power lines.  Multiple routers and wifi and extenders, etc.  Then I read about mesh networks.  And did my research.  Wow.  My life has changed !! Eero is amazing.  Easy to set up.  Easy to use.

sp,"September 30, 2016 ",5.0,"OK, check my past reviews and see no raving about anything. This was phenomenal!  Best product ever!  No instructions, uses a IOS app (I'm sure there is an android equivalent).  If I had a normal situation, I would have been up and running in 5 minutes. My situation was challenging, because I get a very bad/no service signal on my cell phone without my ATT microcell which comes over the wifi network. So when I tried to do the install which begins with the router off, I would constantly loses cell service which halted the install. I was halted hundreds of times but eero kept remembering where I was and eventually completed the install. Now I have faster wifi then ever before and the same throughout my 2200 sq ft house. I have 3 eeros and I might have been OK with just 2 units. Love this thing!  I have watched this product for a year wondering if it was worth the price, and it is- and more so with the $100 price reduction. I am a FAN! ",
"Stuart Siegel","January 3, 2017 ",5.0,"My house is 2400 sqft. rambler that is &#34;L&#34; shaped. The Internet connection enters the house all the way at one end.    I have tried powerline adapters, wifi extenders and high end wifi routers. Short of paying $750.00 - $1000.00 to wire the house with Cat6 this is the easiest solution.    I started with the 3pack. They were very easy to setup. The first week I had some connectivity issues so I purchased a 4th. I'm guessing the issues had to do more with the fact of where I wanted to place the units. I probably could have had put them in other less than desirable locations and I would have been fine.    I noticed that over time signal got more reliable perhaps the MIMO antenna learns where to concentrate its power in each unit.    The eero creates a &#34;mesh&#34; network so your devices will seemlessly switch between units.    Another excellent feature is that each eero has two radios inside one for sending and one for receiving data. This means unlike traditional extenders your data speed aren't cut in half with each additional unit.    I would recommend them for anyone who wants a reliable wifi network in their house. ",

SuperJon,"September 30, 2016 ",5.0,"I installed this system in my small office approximately three weeks ago.  We have 15 devices connecting to them wirelessly.  So far, they have worked flawlessly.  They are incredibly easy to setup using the free mobile app.  They offer superb bandwidth via WiFi and seem to really do well at not dropping connections.  I have absolutely zero complaints so far.  As well, the range for each module is very impressive.  We can easily go 100 ft in any direction and have excellent signal.    My one favorite feature about the EERO system compared to several other similar systems I was looking at, is that each module has two ethernet ports on that back that allow two things to be available: 1) I can hardwire devices at my office(that do not have wifi option) to these via ethernet cable, and 2) I can hardwire the modules via ethernet back to the main unit serving as the router which provides a more robust setup with a much less chance of dropouts.

However I ended up returning them after a prolonged troubleshooting with the otherwise excellent customer service. I had multiple periodic but recurring issues with the eero. First and foremost my Sonos systems really did not like the eero system - my players would drop off the network randomly and there would be much skipping and stopping of music play. Occasionally my streaming devices would lose connectivity too, but the frequency was much less so than with Sonos. The eero troubleshooting seemed fixated on my netgear gigabit switch which they thought eero did work well with. Since I couldn't detach my wired network for extended periods the troubleshooting stalled and I decided to return the eero. As contrast - I replaced it with the Orbi mesh network router. All of my Sonos devices have worked perfectly since, I have had no issues with my streaming devices. Connectivity and speed seem really good and my wired switch is operating as expected so my recommendation would be to go with Orbi (which is also the mesh &#34;pick&#34; by the Wirecutter blog). ",

Michael,"December 26, 2016 ",5.0,"Fantastic.  I live in a 4 story house and was using a patchwork quilt of wireless routers, but still had dead zones everywhere, dropped signals and all sorts of problems.  I set up the eero system using 1 eero for each floor and it works perfectly.  The eeros are each plugged in to an ethernet jack.  However, I had to configure the system in a specific way that may be of interest to some of you.  The house is wired with ethernet jacks on each floor; they all emanate from the basement where the signal comes in from Time Warner Cable.  I had to get 4 eeros, and put one of them upstream of the switch that channels the signals to the different rooms.  Furthermore, I had to get a new switch since the very old linksys device I used to be using as a switch would not stop handing out its own IP addresses no matter how many times I changed its parameters telling it not to!  The eeros did not like that and got confused.  Once I bought a simple new 16-port switch, everything worked perfectly.    There's another product out there called Ubiquiti Unifi wireless access points, but apparently you have to be a tech genius to set it up and the tech support is non-existent.  Avoid at all costs. ",

I'll admit the price tag gave me pause initially, but I was desperate for a solution to inconsistent WiFi throughout my home and constantly buffering Netflix and Hulu. We don't have cable, so streaming quality is important to us. The system came highly recommended by a friend who had similar issues, so I gave it a try. I had tried various routers and range extenders (wired and wireless) in the past, none of which seemed to work as advertised.    First, and most importantly, the system works. It created a single, continuous network throughout my home. I don't have to switch networks when I'm on the patio or upstairs and my online and streaming experience is now what I expect it to be. We have phones, tablets, computers, printers, Sonos, Roku, etc. all connected to a single network and it works awesome.    The packaging was clean and elegant. The setup could not have been more simple. The iPhone app is incredible. It allows me to monitor the network, see which devices are connected, test download and upload speeds, turn on/off guest access, and more.    After several weeks, one of the units wasn't connecting to the network, so I called their support number. It was late on a Sunday evening and I was connected with a polite, English-speaking representative.

It was very easy to set up, and all our devices work with it (laptops, Apple TV, Roku, iTouch, iphone, Nintendo DS, Wii U, etc).  The new family profiles let me manage our kids' devices individually, automatically cutting them off an hour before bedtime and letting me pause their access at any time.  I can also see all devices on the network and manage them individually.  The app is easy to use and I can use it anywhere.  I use the guest network for babysitters and other guests and can turn if off and/or change the password easily thru the app.  Note - Only issue we did have was the Apple TV dropping access, but we used a network cable to connect it directly into one of the Eero units and have had no more dropping.

The concept is elegant, you add more if you need to, and I believe they all take care of the housekeeping between them, handing you from one to the other as you move around your house.  No more waiting while my device hunts for a different supplier of the same wifi signal while it switches from the main wifi to the range extender.  No more 'the server timed out because your device appears to be offline' messages. I would always think &#34;I didn't stop paying for that internet - it's still there, and I shouldn't have to coax a device into communicating with my router&#34;.  Also the design is pleasing, the squared-off white hockey puck doesn't look like much wherever it's placed, and the cord from the bit that plugs into the wall outlet is long enough that you have placement options.

First of all I use a Blackberry OS 10 device (Blackberry Passport) and the first step is to download their eero app which as a Blackberry OS10 user you can download the android app from Google Play Store on Blackberry OS10 (see Cobalt guide at crackberry.com on how to install Google Play Store on Blackberry OS10 devices) or you can download it from 1MobileMarket but oddly even though I bought this product from Amazon, the eero app was not available in the Amazon App Store.  Anyway, the eero app RUNS PEFECTCLY on Blackberry OS10 so I'm sure it will run perfectly on true Android phones as well, and they also have eero for Apple iPhone.  As far as installation and setup it was the easiest sweetest wifi setup ever.  You first install the eero app and then the app takes you through the install and setup of the equipment.  My existing setup was a Cisco DPC3208 Cable Modem on the Charter Cable network and a Netgear WNDR3400v3 for providing wired connections plugged into the ethernet port of the Cisco Modem.  The eero devices have two ports.  You can use one port for the connection to the modem and the other port (they are equivalent ports btw) you can use to plug in a switch for wired connections.  I added the switch last after everything was completely setup by plugging it into the extra port on the gateway eero attached to the modem.  So the setup is done from the eero app. All the steps went totally smoothly with no problems - sweet.  There was one page though after the initial connection and plug-in of everything where it said something like &#34;network not detected plug in your router&#34; but I just pressed next to the next step and it detected the network immediately so not sure what was up with that page.  All the rest of the steps were totally smooth.  You take the next eero and position it somewhere in the house where you need wifi and then once all the eero have been added to the network (which is ALL done by the eero APP - it tells you what is happening and what if anything you need to do next).  Then the app prompts if you want to download updates to the eero software and I tapped yes and that took about 10 minutes or so and went through with no problems at all.  Now one cool thing is that this eero network was TOTALLY ADDITIVE.  The existing Cisco Modem has a wireless network built-in too, and that is still working and available, but now the eero network is added too so there are two networks to choose from, with the eero being the extendable network (I could buy another eero unit and add it to the network if necessary).  I give this product 5 stars and would give it 6 stars if I could!  It's a really easy to deploy great product that works and just adds on to your existing network at least for my network. ",
thepollara,"February 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I have many years of experience with frustrating routers, devices and service providers. Over the years I've encountered nearly every problem known to man around residential internet and wireless networks. If you value having reliable connectivity and have at least six wireless devices then you should totally make the investment in the Eero device.    I also really like having admin control over my devices via the mobile app. The app allows you to boot any device and group them so you know exactly which device is connected and how they contribute to the bandwidth load on your network. Also some really clean features for managing temporary guest networks. I have a vertical layout townhouse, 2,000 sq ft with four floors between the basement and roof terrace. I installed my Eero 3 pack wired via ethernet but I found that even the two pack was very effective. I have 100mbps service with 14 connected devices (5 of which are wired using a gigabit switch). ",
"Paco M. Aubrejuan","April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"I've struggled with wifi coverage in my house for a long time.  My router is at one end of the house, and my television on the other end.  I purchased three different high end routers over the past couple of years, and each of them worked intermittently.  I would have to reboot my router every couple days as my bandwidth at the far end of my house lagged.    I read the review for Eero and saw that it received high scores in two key areas for me:  First, I wanted something that was super simple to install and maintain.  I only need one feature- for the router to work.  Second, I wanted it to be super stable and not cycle between working well and not working well.  I can say now that the Eero is a perfect 10/10 on both of these requirements.  I haven't had to reboot a single time in the last month, and my family has finally stopped complaining about the bad wifi signal.  It is well worth the extra money to finally have a router system that works and continues to work. ",
"Mary Ventura","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"5 years ago I moved from a 1300 sqft home to a 3300 sqft home. And for 5 years I have struggled to get consistent, high quality coverage throughout our space.  I have spent at least $300 in modems, wifi routers and extenders, not to mention hours...sometimes the better part of an entire day setting a network up, only to find equipment isn't compatible and I need to start over.    We had made due with one extender that needed to be reset about 3x week.    When I heard about Eero I was excited, maybe my evenings of crawling out of bed in the middle of a show to reset the signal were over.    They ARE!!! Eero is as amazing as I heard it was!!!  I set the whole system (I bought the 3 pack) up in about 30 minutes- that includes time spent reading the instructions.  We have a network, a personalized password that makes sense...not the weird random series of characters everyone hates but beginners don't know how to change...    (For reference, I don't consider myself a beginner in this work, I am tech savvy and able to work my way through networks and systems, however setting up multiple different extenders on one network proved difficult for me. We had personalized network password before eero).    I can control everything from my phone...not much to control but I can see how many devices are on the signal, turn the device lights off/on, and see the speeds I'm uploading/downloading at.    Also, the diagram says to centralize all the hubs, but due to the odd layout of our house it just wasn't possible. Even without the centralizing we have full signal in every room, including our garages and backyard. We basically cover 1/2 an acre!!! It's not full strength all over, but it's covers the space!    We have been up and running solidly for a month now...no issues!    The CONS-  *I know I should list $$$, however I think the quality of the devices compared to the cost I've spent trying to get what this delivers is fairly comparable...I'd much rather spend the money once on one functional product than little bits at a time trying to make something work that just doesn't ever get there.  *Ethernet outlets are limited. This isn't a huge deal, but our printer is outdated and we needed a way to connect it. Updating printer now. ",
Doug,"June 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I installed this eero (pack of 3 unit) combo mesh system as soon as I received them via Amazon Prime. Because I was also installing Comcast 150mbps Internet service the next day and until installed , I continued to use the slower att DSL solution that day with these new units with a WiFi ssid already configured to my own desired WiFi IDs/passwords. Then using these eero units, I just power cycled then reconnected to the nice/simple Netgear cable modem(CM600-100NAS) I ordered at the same time as I ordered these eero units, just changing a the 10BaseT cable from the att gateway to new Comcast modem when Comcast lit up the service the following day at my house.    With the Comcast service, I wanted better WiFi coverage than supplied by any Comcast gateway integrated router. Plus I did-not want to lease any cablemodem/routher wifi equipment from Comcast (ROI of providing myself less than a year).  It seemed like the eero was a possible clean solution, providing better wifi coverage than available using the gateways provided under lease from my ISP (Comcast).    The eero packaging was very clean and well marked for &#34;how to install&#34; and the iPhone application to do the actual set-up was surprisingly very simple to use. After installing the initial set of eero's with full success, I decided to get fancy as I wanted to get &#34;5 bars of coverage&#34; everywhere in a rather large home footprint along with a separate detached storage area/building, so I ordered a 2nd set of eeros to expand my newly installed wifi mesh network.    After expanding my eero mesh network, all went well again except some results with speedtest.net were more inconsistant than before my eero added expansion. To understand what was going on I rang a call into the eero support line (link to call right on the Iphone eero application(and iphone application easy to use, configure ssids/passwords, adding a guest network, etc). This support call I made is where eero really shined because:  A gentleman named Dave answered the phone at the eeros support number. Dave was not just a phone agent answering and reading from a script. Rather, he was obviously a well educated/experienced IT networking professional with good customer support skills. After reviewing my home network configuration and my concerns, Dave ran a performance test between my eeros and while doing so answered my many rather detailed questions (I'm &#34;retired from IT&#34;) with accuracy which I really appreciated. The quality of Dave's efforts working with me by phone was superb. It turns out I had two erros closer than need be, and in the end Dave's time with me over the phone assisted me in tuning this new eeros mesh network perfectly.  It's been flawless since.    In addition, as a side benefit of the eero design: each remote eero in the mesh network provides a spare 10BaseT port that can be used to connect a hardwired device (TV, PC, switch, etc) if desired, or be used, if a hardwired network is available, as a &#34;backhaul&#34; to the erro that is plugged into the cable modem.    So bottom line, eero provided me a perfect homerun solution.    Doug ",
Shopgirl17,"January 13, 2017 ",5.0,"It's truely worth the hype! I have had my eero for a few days now and I am super impressed. My home is over 2400 sq feet and I was constantly restarting my previous router. I always had dead spots and could never run more than 3 devices at once. Now with eero I have 9 devices on wifi with no lags, no buffering, and no slowness at all. I am truely amazed. I would curse my modem, router, and ISP everday because I was constantly power cycling my modem and router multiple times a day.  NOT ANY MORE since I have eero! It's worth $500 but I got it for $100 less on Prime Day. If you are experiencing the same issues then get past the $500 price tag. It is worth it. ",
"gustav zantanon","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I love old sturdy houses. They don't build 'em like they used to. Unfortunately, in 1873 WIFI was in it's infancy. Check that. It might have only been a glimmer in Jules Verne's or H.G.Wells' eyes. Anyway, these days thick plaster and lath walls soak up a WIFI signal like Bounty Towels on a TV ad. Plus the floor plan of my house puts the Entertainment room on the far end of the house. To explain my inability to connect or the eternal spinning vortex of the buffering icon I have always found lotsa blame with 1-My Internet Service Providers (even switching companies in my frustration) 2-The content providers server farms 3-Poltergeists (I am waiting for the day customer service for the above will invoke this as the best explanation). I tried two different WIFI extenders. There was only a teenie bit of improvement. The second extender claimed to be using both frequencies, but no improvements.    Then I saw a sidebar ad on Amazon (thank you for not using pop-ups) for a new concept in WIFI delivery for the home. Eero uses multiple devices strategically placed through the building to boost the signal. This time I read the directions before I started installing. But hey, I got excited, and soon realized I had plugged all three devices into power and totally out of order. While I was scolding my impetuosity, my Android (smartphone not the little electronic french maid* I also found on Amazon) told me that setup was complete and successful. My immediate skepticism is understandable (see above) so I do what I always do when my mother tells me juicy gossip from her neighborhood--trust but verify. I turned TV on, went to Internet content and clicked on Amazon Prime (seemed to be previously most finicky). To my delight, I watched an entire hour of the excellent series &#34;The Man in the High Castle&#34; without a single buffering pause. Yea. I am going to quit writing so I can get back to binge watching. Hope this helps    *Disclaimer: To the best of my knowledge, Amazon has no current or future plans to offer Android Maids to the general public.

"Irene Erlin","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I have tried many extender router, different brands from cheap to the most expensive ones, somehow all of them always gave problems such as disconnected many times, signal lost, super difficult to do the setting etc. Eero was my one last attempt, and it worked like magic. Very easy to install even for people who knows nothing about router setting, just install the app, tap tap tap. Signal strong, no disconnection, simply work. I had a problem before and tried to contact the customer support, their response was super, I got personal help one on one who patiently helped me find the problem. One downside though: it's expensive, but compare to what I have spent with many brands that now just stay in my drawer, I say Eero is definitely the best investment! ",
"Richard Nelson","April 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I had read about these and researched them.  at nearly $500 it was a little more that I wanted to spend.

The two airports would work well for a week and then it would get slower , slower and eventually need to be rebooted and then the saga continues for a week. Now I have a 3 eero setup and a minimum 30Mbps in space I used to get 5 , and most of the house 230Mbps , the network has been stable for a month with no crashes. Eero has updated the firmware at least 6 times silently and constantly improving in the background with no interruptions to the network. This is truly something which simplifies Wifi and just works. I'm excited to see some more features for QoS and other aspects like manual ability to restart the routers , mac addressing filtering or IP filtering . I gave it 4 stars because it holds onto my network which no other router has been able to , a missing star as it does not have all the features which compares itself to other routers in that category ",
Stark,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have never done an Amazon review before, but I wanted to share the fantastic experience I have had with eeroâ€”both the product and the company.    First, the product: Not much needs to be said except that I now have blazingly fast wifi throughout my house. It could not be easier to set up. The hardware is elegant and unobtrusive, unlike the alien spacecraft that other wifi companies seem to be producing these days. Also, the eero model of constant updates and improvements is far superior to what you will get from other companies. My eeros have already updated themselves several times, with improvements in performance and new features added.    As for the company, I cannot say enough about how great they are to work with. I did have some problems initially with streaming music services not working properly. I contacted eero, and they worked tirelessly to figure out what the problem was. The problem turned out to be related to another component in my network (not the eeros themselves) but they saw it through until the problem was solved. I now have no problems whatsoever with my network and in fact everything works much better than before. Also, unlike with other companies, I did not receive generic emails with general suggestions and links to online help documents. Instead, I exchanged emails with a single customer service representative who actually took the time to respond to my specific questions and worked with me until my problem was solved. For me, this kind of service and attention to detail makes the eero system worth every penny. This is a company that truly cares about its customers and about getting it right.    Conclusion: Buy it, you wonâ€™t be disappointed! ",

In the past, I have had slow wireless coverage in the upstairs area, eero's able to extend the coverage in a noticeable manner.

About 15 minutes after opening the box, eero was updated and broadcasting. I've never had a problem since. My ISP (Comcast unfortunately) provides 75Mbps; every speed test I've run with eero indicates 80+. The handoff of devices from one router to the next is equally impressive. The real kicker is the wall to wall coverage though; signal strength is routinely double that (160+), when before that I felt lucky to get 10.

GreatWhiteShark,"December 9, 2016 ",5.0,"This is my second time giving eero a try.

Fast forward to 6 months later after being frustrated with AT&amp;T speeds I switched over to Wave Broadband and got the 250 Mbps down and 10 Mbps package. Initially I took there generic cable modem/wifi router. What a disappointment, I had better speeds than with AT&amp;T however I was not getting what I paid for.

We have a 2-story home and my wife has her office in our detached garage. Getting good wifi coverage has been impossible. To try to improve things, I originally purchased a typical range extender. That helped... but it was inconsistent - would sometimes provide a great signal on our second floor and in the garage, but often not - which might have been more frustrating than not having it at all. I was always rebooting it to try to get it to work.    I bought the Eero system out of desperation. Didn't want to have to go to a wired system, but didn't have much hope that it would actually do the job. I figured with my Prime membership and Amazon's return policy, I didn't have much to lose. I ordered 4 just to make sure I'd have adequate coverage in our home.    From the moment I plugged them in, things just worked. It was like magic. I didn't want to believe it at first - I kept our other router pumping out it's signal thinking that the Eero network would fail at any moment. It didn't. Ever.

We had tried 3 different internet companies, and a wifi extender, plus we tried two different modems on our current internet provider...to no avail.

"James Nguyen","February 18, 2017 ",5.0,"Three pack eero replacing a home network with a Netgear R7000 router plugged directly into our FIOS modem, from there were 3 ethernet over power line connections (mixture of Netgear and D-Link) to reach problematic spots for wi-fi reception and in one case, a device that required an ethernet connection, and finally, one Netgear AC750 wireless repeater.  All in all, the stuff all worked, my devices were online, and on the whole, happy.  It wast just simply a lot of stuff to maintain, especially with the odd event like a power outage causing me to have to at times connect/re-connect things, reboot, diagnose, etc.    Save for one  powerline adapter for the one device that requires a hardwire, everything above is replaced with the three eeros and I couldn't be happier......so far.  I feel I need to keep that caveat in place for the time being.  The system has been in place for several days and has worked w/o a hitch (more on that below) whereas the system it replaced has been cobbled together over years and again, mostly did the job well.    Setup was super easy and guided by the app.  I did encounter a slight hiccup on the installation of the first eero as it seemingly required my phone to have an internet connection to be able to proceed w/ the installation wizard.  Problem is that I live in a remote hilltop setting and reliable 3G/4G isn't a given and as such, the wizard crapped out a couple times.  Some awkward positioning of my body with my phone near a window got the phone online and a 3rd run of the wizard breezed through in seconds.  From there, the first eero was pumping out an internet connection that made the addition of the next two devices super quick.    Network speed tests bear out very noticeable improvements, both upstream and downstream for my Southern CA based FIOS service (formerly Verizon, now Frontier).    Prior to this, using my Macbook Pro and Speedtest.Net, downstream speeds averaged around 85 Mb/s give or take 5 Mb/s.  With the eeros, I've been getting very consistent 100-103 Mb/s.  Upstream has been eye opening.  Previous to this, with my Netgear R7000, upstream averaged 30 Mb/s, give or take 5 Mb/s.  With the eeros in place, I have seen ranging from 107 to 118 (!!!) Mb/s.  This has been consistently tested w/ the same laptop and the same speed test from various parts of the home with no noticeable differences from tests run from any part of the home from another.    Perhaps there were configuration errors on my Netgear, but other than the DNS provider and admin password, everything on the machine was left stock.  I'm a fairly technical guy and the Netgear UI (scarily amongst the better ones out there) was so crappy and daunting that I dared not mess with anything.  The eero seemingly has a ton less capability in the app, but if I were being honest with myself, I wasn't using those features on the Netgear either-- e.g. DMZs, QoS, etc.  It would be nice to see more and more advanced features rolled out in the future, but I really don't feel like I'm giving up much.  ESPECIALLY when taking into consideration the reduced footprint of networking gear I have deployed, the fact that the units themselves are far less bulky and eye catching (in a bad way).  And factoring in the improved networking speeds I'm seeing on my actual devices themselves (and not just speedtests run at the router level itself), it makes my decision to swap over a total no brainer and absolutely worth every penny.  Many are balking at the cost, but factoring the cost of all the pieces I previously deployed, I'm fairly sure they surpass the cost of this 3 pack. ",

DALJONES,"November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I rarely write reviews, but this has proven worthy of my efforts.  On many occasions over the past 10 years, my wifi network has caused me to seriously contemplate liquidating all of my assets and spending my remaining years tracking down the evil geniuses who created them.  I'm not particularly computer savvy, but I've always been able to follow online instructions to do port forwarding or create static ip's and the like.  This however has always been a trap, one that leads me to believe I can manage my wifi network and make it......actually work (imagine that).  After several different routers, a couple of range extenders and countless hours I would have rather been doing anything else, I finally gave up!  Following much research, I took the plunge and paid full price (gulp) for a 3 pack of the Eero's.  This has all been done with Time Warner Cable (if that matters).    The Pros:  1. It took me about 20 minutes to setup the network w/3 Eero's....easily the simplest setup I've ever done!  2. My 2,000 sq. ft. 2 story house and my attached 1,000 sq. ft garage all have very strong wifi.  3. I can nickname my devices so it's easy for me to see what's on the network.  4. I easily grouped devices together that my kids use and set times they can't access wifi.  5. I can access my network to pause/un-pause wifi for specific devices or for everything, even when I'm not home (using the iphone app).  6. I've had it setup for about a week and it's been flawless!  All my speed tests in every area of the house are at my providers max capacity!  7. I had a question about setting up the app for me and my wife.  I called in and was told they were experiencing high call volumes, but someone answered about 10 seconds later and quickly helped me get things done.  8. The iPhone app interface is very easy to use....and it all makes sense.  They've simplified it to be used by actual human beings....ones that don't work on computers for a living.  An example:  I wanted to do some port forwarding....all I had to do was forward the port AND the app actually suggested that I make a static IP so I don't lose the port forwarding if the device doesn't connect to that ip in the future!  I always had to learn that the hard way.  Eero's then took me right to the screen to set the static ip!  9. It actually works...everywhere...all the time...imagine that!    Cons:  1. Somewhat spendy.  However, it's much cheaper than a kidney, or my firstborn....which is what I was contemplating trading to anyone who could solve my wifi dilemmas.    I'll update this review in the future if my Eero's turns on me, betrays my trust, or does anything else you should be warned about. ",

"gustav zantanon","January 3, 2017 ",5.0,"I love old sturdy houses. They don't build 'em like they used to. Unfortunately, in 1873 WIFI was in it's infancy. Check that. It might have only been a glimmer in Jules Verne's or H.G.Wells' eyes. Anyway, these days thick plaster and lath walls soak up a WIFI signal like Bounty Towels on a TV ad. Plus the floor plan of my house puts the Entertainment room on the far end of the house. To explain my inability to connect or the eternal spinning vortex of the buffering icon I have always found lotsa blame with 1-My Internet Service Providers (even switching companies in my frustration) 2-The content providers server farms 3-Poltergeists (I am waiting for the day customer service for the above will invoke this as the best explanation). I tried two different WIFI extenders. There was only a teenie bit of improvement. The second extender claimed to be using both frequencies, but no improvements.    Then I saw a sidebar ad on Amazon (thank you for not using pop-ups) for a new concept in WIFI delivery for the home. Eero uses multiple devices strategically placed through the building to boost the signal. This time I read the directions before I started installing. But hey, I got excited, and soon realized I had plugged all three devices into power and totally out of order. While I was scolding my impetuosity, my Android (smartphone not the little electronic french maid* I also found on Amazon) told me that setup was complete and successful. My immediate skepticism is understandable (see above) so I do what I always do when my mother tells me juicy gossip from her neighborhood--trust but verify. I turned TV on, went to Internet content and clicked on Amazon Prime (seemed to be previously most finicky). To my delight, I watched an entire hour of the excellent series &#34;The Man in the High Castle&#34; without a single buffering pause. Yea. I am going to quit writing so I can get back to binge watching. Hope this helps    *Disclaimer: To the best of my knowledge, Amazon has no current or future plans to offer Android Maids to the general public. I believe you need to sign up for Amazon Prime** to make such a purchase.  **No, that's not true either. Good bye. ",

buzzaxe,"July 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I Comcast as internet provider. I have a 3-level house and modem is in basement.The struggle has been to get WiFi to the rest of the house. The modem by itself was not effective at all. Like many, I tried to extend to the rest of the house using WiFi extenders (plug in to wall type). These worked ok but I still could only get between 18 and 46 Mbps. I was thinking this was as good as it was going to get until I saw the eero product.  I purchased the 3-pack and was impressed with how easy it was to setup (via iPhone app). Connected the first to the basement modem which created a new WiFi network and then connected the others throughout the house. I placed one on the first floor and one on the second floor. The eero app you download helps to get everything setup and could not believe how easy it was. I am now consistently running between 112-125 Mbps regardless of where I am at in the house. I also run multiple Xbox one consoles and Netflix, YouTube, etc. are no longer dropping connections.  I was able to get the $100 discount so my price for the 3 pack was $399. For me it was well worth because frustration with dropped or slow connections has stopped.    One quirk is that after setting up one of the eero, I had to move it but could not get it to reconnect. My solution was to remove it from the network with the iPhone app, reset the device (on the back of the eero using a needle/safety pin), and then adding back to the network using the app. Worked great after that.    Would definitely recommend this although the price is a little steep. ",
"Scott E Larson","February 19, 2017 ",5.0,"THANKS EERO!  GREAT PRODUCT!    My eero system was easy to set up and get working, but took some tweaking (with the placement of the devices - working with eero tech support) to REALLY dial up the performance.    Initial setup was simple once I turned my phone's bluetooth on...the first time I tried (with bluetooth off) it failed (obvious, in hindsight).  After my setup was complete, my wifi performance was as-good (and sometimes better) than my existing wifi network, which consisted of three (3) Apple Airport Extreme base stations, which mostly adequately covered most/all of my house but which did experience the occasional (always frustrating) dropouts.  I found my initial performance was mostly better than my 3-Apple-Airport-Extreme solution, and at slightly lower cost (3 eeros are ~$500, 3 Apple Airport Extremes are (179 *3) ~$580).    Once I moved the &#34;eero base station&#34; across the room (so that it was now adjacent to an &#34;internal wall&#34; instead of being next to an &#34;external wall&#34; as it had been initially), performance of the eero's became markedly better than the Apple Airport Extremes.    I'll be getting rid of my Apple Airport Extremes now! ",
"Amazon Customer","November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"This is the wifi I have been waiting for! I am absolutely amazed at how well this works. I will admit, I was skeptical especially after trying everything else. I have tried moving my wireless router out in the open, trying multiple extenders in multiple locations, changing ISP companies, and nothing has helped. The eero system simply works and works very well. I never write reviews, but I feel like this product warranted one. The price is right at the amount where you can't just impulse buy something like this. It took me several weeks to pull the trigger, but knowing what I know now, I would have bought eero a long time ago. My internet speeds in areas that were previous dead zones are faster now than what I was getting standing right next to my previous router. If it keeps working this well, I will be a customer for life. ",
K.F.,"July 6, 2016 ",5.0,"Despite a few hiccups, the system has been great.    My setup: I have a ~1400 sq ft, 2 story home. I bought 2 eeros so that I could place one downstairs (with my modem) and one upstairs where I used to have issues with connectivity. Prior to purchasing the eero system I had a tplink router and a tplink wifi extender plugged in upstairs. This worked in some cases but I had issues with devices dropping the network and even one device that would/could not connect to the wifi at all. My home has a second floor hallway which is open to the first floor.    Pros: I am getting faster internet. Devices are no longer dropping off the network. All my devices can now connect. The eero looks sleek and the app is pretty easy to use.    Cons: The system seems to be a bit finicky when it comes to placement of the eeros. It said to have the eero at person level but the only way I could get the upstairs eero to connect was to move the downstairs eero up onto a ~8 ft high shelf. Now, the two eeros have line of sight without any walls but it was still a little bit of a dance to get them to &#34;see&#34; each other. Maybe once you have them connected you can move them more easily. I don't have a need to since it works as is, but it wasn't as straight forward a process as I had hoped. Enough to make it not worth it? No. Enough to mention? I think so. Also I messed up connecting an ethernet switch, but once I explained my problem, it was updated on the help site. All in all, I think highly of the company and the product. ",
CSherr,"July 17, 2016 ",5.0,"Man, I really, really wanted these to work. The setup on them was *way* faster than the Linksys Velops. Their range is lower than the Velops, but I was okay with that because all I wanted was consistent, reliable wifi. While they started out slower than the linksys, they were still fast enough for everything we needed. The problem comes that within a week or two the speed drops off to almost nothing. I had my macbook pro literally 2 feet from one of the hardwired base stations. I was getting 2mbps. I restarted the base station (which requires you to unplug/plug it back in). After it came back up, I was getting 180mbps again. Not having to restart the eeros was the only reason I bought them (i.e. rock solid wifi). Their support was fairly good, but we never could get them to work 100%. So, I returned them. At this point, I'm back to using 4 airport extremes (all hardwired) around my house. I haven't had any issues since. ",
"eero support","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"We had an older WiFi with an extender that gave us constant headaches -- we often had to unplug the units several times a day and signal strength was uneven throughout our large house. After doing research on the eero vs. Google's unit, we decided on the eero not only because of the good reviews (in Amazon and in the technical press) but also because Google requires you to make the unit part of the ever-creeping Google ecosystem that watches everything you do in searches, emails, and the like, and adds it to the profile it keeps for you in order to sell ads more targeted to how they have you categorized. I would rather have my WiFi system just do its work without whispering about me to Google in the background!    The system is dead easy to set up -- literally, we just plugged and played, following the directions in the app. It worked right out of the box. Since installing eero, we have had flawless service - no interruptions and signal strength throughout the house is high.    The design of the units is sleek and unobtrusive. Although we didn't need to ask for help, apparently the support offered is excellent.    This works as well as any modern internet product we have put into service in recent years. Completely satisfied; would recommend and buy again if need arose. ",

Now with eero I have 9 devices on wifi with no lags, no buffering, and no slowness at all. I am truely amazed. I would curse my modem, router, and ISP everday because I was constantly power cycling my modem and router multiple times a day.  NOT ANY MORE since I have eero!

Shopgirl17,"March 12, 2017 ",5.0,"Just go buy this thing if you want flawless wifi all over your house and yard.  I bought this product with the hopes of having good wifi around my pool and that I could put Sonos speakers (that run on wifi) in my gazebo by my pool.  It works better than I could've ever imagined.  My previous setup had spotty reception at the back door.  Now I have full bars consistently on the other side of my pool (probably 50 ft from the back door). I was able to setup Sonos speakers out there and it works like a charm.    The setup for this is about as easy as it gets. You might have to play with it a little bit once you get it setup with the placement of each Eero for maximum performance, but you could probably put them anywhere and it would work great. I tried them in a couple of different rooms, they worked great everywhere, but some configuration seemed to work a little better than others.    Yes, it's expensive.  Like some reviews will tell you, if your a smart guy, you could probably rig up your own custom open mesh network that would the same for a fraction of the cost.  But I don't know how to do that, nor do I want to learn...I just want my wifi to work.  I recently cut the cable cord and we watch everything over streaming internet now, so I was able to justify this to my self.  This cost is just a few months of savings from not having a cable bill.    There's a lot of cool little features the app has too.  I probably don't know them all, but it has a built in way to run a speed test.  It somehow makes my wifi faster.  My plan is &#34;up to 25mbps&#34; and before, I would get a wide range of results from 2-18mbps.  Rarely ever 20+.  Now with Eero, 28mbps is the norm.  It has an option where you can just text your network name and password to others you want to allow on your network.  There's also a way to create a guest network, which i haven't done yet, but seems like it would be ideal for maybe a Fantasy Football draft where you could grant a bunch of people temporary access to your network and then remove it afterwards.    I've had trouble with wifi for years and this was my solution...man I wish I had this 5 years ago! ",

Considering our home and numerous other devices are run via wifi, and, anticipating more to come, this unit is well worth the investment!    Set-up was simple and straightforward; finding placement for the three units was key, but not difficult. NOTE: Only challenge:  all but one of our Roku devices/TVs failed to connect to wifi after install. I waited 48+ hours for Eero auto updates before calling their customer Service.  Pleased to say, C/S was excellent.  Time Warner is our internet provider. Their Arris Surfboard 6183 Modem didn't seem to play well with the Eero system. I purchased my own Asus Surfboard 6190 (benefit: no longer paying rental fee) and Bingo!, all connected. No issues since, which is saying alot for the number of devices connected (Tablets, laptops, thermostadefs, printers).  C/S Follow-up is outstanding. ",
Sean,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Setting up eero was for me a revelation on par with using TiVo for the first time. I set up 3 units on 3 floors of a brick townhouse in about 10 minutes. The best part for me has been &#34;administering&#34; the network remotely through the iOS app. I have some guests staying at my place, and I didn't have to run over there to set up a guest network for them and change the password. You can also keep tabs on how many devices are on the network at any time.    In my case, the wireless router (TP-Link) that I replaced was acceptable. The eeros just penetrate more of the house. I plan to experiment more with placement, as I plan to add at least one wifi security camera to the network. It would be a good feature if the eero smartphone app guided you on placement or told you if, for example, moving one of the devices to a new location helped or hurt.    Overall a fantastic experience in my first few days. ",

KH,"October 2, 2016 ",5.0,"works great. ended up buying a 3rd (should have bought the 3 pack). I have 3 floors in my house. The eero in the upper and lower floor are direct wired to my switch. The one in the middle floor is wireless only. Did a speed test with a Ethernet connection from the middle floor eero to my laptop, get to 250mbps pretty constantly which is great. Bought these to be able to have a continuous wifi signal on the same network ID. It takes a little time for devices to switch over, so I sometimes have to turn airplane mode off/on quickly to get the strongest signal. If you wait a few minutes, it does it usually automatically.  Important &#62; if you want to direct wire them, then you CANNOT just connect them all to a switch (unless I got that info wrong). After some research, I found that you have to connect the primary directly to your router with the one Ethernet port and then connect the 2nd Ethernet port to your switch. There should be a bit more documentation on that. ",

"Michael Green","September 17, 2016 ",5.0,"I installed two of these in a small house and the coverage is outstanding. That's not surprising given the size of the house, but the more interesting thing is how well the devices work. With multiple access points, I used to have to occasionally mess with WiFi on my phone to get it to associate with  the device with the strongest signal. At other times, I would have to take extra steps to get things to connect with WiFi at all. After installing the eero access points, I don't even have to think about WiFi. Another feature that is a positive is how the system updates. It just happens and you get notified. No downloading firmware and rebooting. It's not that hard to update firmware on an access point, but it's much nicer to know that the system is just taking care of that and then letting you know. It really is the case that these are very easily installed and then just work. That says lots about the care and thought that went into the engineering and user experience design. ",

"Michael Brown","September 7, 2016 ",5.0,"Very happy customer here!  I first heard of the eero system from the Cult of Mac podcast (if you're an Apple fan and haven't heard it yet, I highly suggest you give it a go).  One of the podcasters was raving about how the eero had massively improved the wifi coverage in his home, and I was instantly intrigued.  My house is about 1,300 square feet and the modem sits in one corner while the Apple TV sits in the diagonally opposite corner.  Before eero, shows on Netflix, Amazon, etc. would constantly pause to buffer, which of course can be quite frustrating.  The price tag for the three-pack eero system is a hefty one, no denying that, but I justified the purchase because I had some Amazon gift cards that covered half of the cost...and I'm very glad I made that purchase!  Setup was so easy: download the app to your phone and it walks you through in a matter of minutes.  It's suggested that you place your eero devices within sight of each other, but the physical structure of my house makes that impossible.  I have one in each opposite corner, plus one in the hallway in the middle of the house.  It works perfectly!  I will note that the first day I used the system, I noticed a couple of times the blinking light on the devices that indicated loss of connectivity.  However, during that first night the system did its initial software update (so cool that it does it on its own!), and ever since then it's been running flawlessly.  Strong wifi signal throughout the house, zero loss of connectivity, zero spontaneous Netflix bufferings.  If you can swallow the cost of the device, stop thinking about it and just buy it! ",
"Daniel Hosler","February 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Having installed two of these systems, I can tell you they are extraordinarily easy to setup, and monitor through the iphone app. The setup is easy, intuitive, and the troubleshooting if the device is not in a good location was very helpful.    My only suggestion (and it may already be corrected) is as follows. My network sits behind a firewall that is doing the DHCP. In order to get the device setup, and routing correctly for all the fun devices on my network (4 Sonos boxes, Ring doorbell, couple others), you must first setup EERO in front of the firewall. Next step was to then change the IP address to a range within the private network. And lastly, switch into bridge mode. It then takes 15-30 minutes as each EERO needs to restart, and pass along the info.    This was critical in order for all the wireless devices to be able to talk to one another. I think a youtube video showing exactly how this works would be helpful. Again, it may be up there by the time someone reads this. ",
"Retired Engr","August 9, 2016 ",5.0,"I have a 3 story condo and my wi fi wasn't reaching from the bottom to top floor.  I had tried a range extender and, while it allowed me to get an adequate signal where I added the extender, there were still a number of weak spots plus my devices wouldn't always change networks properly.  I read all the reviews on the eero system and finally decided to give it a try.  Most of the reviews I read have already hit the high points.  The 3 devices come well packaged and appear to be robustly built with a good quality finish.  I didn't have any issues setting up the devices using my iPhone; I was up and running in less than 30 minutes.  My signal strength/download rates were improved significantly throughout the house and now there is no need to switch networks since the mesh approach makes the devices look like one network.  After installation, I wanted to move one of the devices for improved coverage; so sent a test to eeros to make sure I knew how.  The response came shortly and it turned out you just unplug the device from its current location and plug it in in the new location; everything synchs up automatically.  I've been running for a couple of months now and everything is still working great.  I definitely would recommend this product. ",

"Joe Consumer","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"We were on the verge of buying another netgear extender for $100 until I heard a blurb on NPR from a reporter talking about ideal Christmas gifts.  The NPR reporter mentioned the eero as her ideal wish list item.  After a bit of research and understanding how eero technology is much more effective at extending wi-fi versus traditional extenders, I decided to purchase the eero two-pack for our two-story, 1,900 sqft home.  The result:  we now get steady wi-fi in our second story back office versus before we had a netgear extender which could not reach the office.  After a month of enjoying the two-pack eero, we got greedy and purchased a third eero unit to amp up wi-fi speed in the upstairs office.  The third unit is the cherry and we are super happy with being able to use our upstairs office instead of camping out in the living room close to the router.    ALSO a side note - when deactivating the router function in our internet service provider's modem and activating the eero router function, I reached out to Spectrum/Time Warner for help. Big kudos to Spectrum/Time Warner for already having knowledge on how to redirect the router from the Spectrum modem to the eero device. ",
Srinivasa,"January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"My home is split over 3 levels. I have a 300 mbps connection which I could never receive reliably or at any significant speed down in the basement. After trying out numerous alternatives (routers, access points, extenders, and power line adapters), I stumbled on eero. I now have 4 of them spread over the house and get the expected 300 mbps from anywhere the house. An expensive proposition at $600 for 4 units -- but boy -- has it been worth it !!    The installation process is super slick and I can see that this will be how setup applications will be in the future -- with a fancy app that guides you at every step and knows what you are doing. A couple of weeks or so after I had installed the eero units, I decided to turn off the WIFI on the router provided by the cable company. This actually improved the performance and reliability of the entire eero system and I suggest everyone do this.    One odd thing that I have noticed is that if the internet connection goes down, the eero that is connected to the router gets very hot. I mean really HOT -- and it may be something the eero folks need to worry about -- perhaps some venting slits in the side or the top of the unit may be required to prevent damage to the unit if the internet connection goes down for extended periods of time.    Apart from this observation regarding an edge condition -- I think the eero is a game changer and a truly amazing product. ",
"Danny Estrada","January 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I work as a management consultant in technology so I came into this with tempered expectations.  I took the EERO out of the box, plugged into the Fios router (which I pay for 75/75 speeds) in the basement and then got all three units green lighted in under 5 minutes.  First test was to try up on the 2nd floor two stories above the router and best I could do before was 10-12 MB speeds.  First test ran over 70/50 MB.    Have now had the system up for over a month...life changing.  Latest test showing 85/85 while 9 devices on the network, setup guest network for friends and family in under 60 seconds, no resets or restarts, getting crazy fast speeds 40 feet from my back door around the pool/patio.  Smart TVs now do not buffer on Amazon Video or Netflix.    The reality is that if you do not have other issues related to internet connectivity or substandard cable wi-fi router that you have to deal with this system should work seamlessly for you.  In full disclosure I have previously purchased an advanced (not Quantum) router directly from Verizon.  Not sure if that's why everything just plugged in and worked great.  I do envision that if you are plugging into older routers you may only be as good as your last &#34;hop&#34; in internet terminology. ",
"Robert J Sorce","August 29, 2016 ",5.0,"There are a few brands offering wireless mesh networking for a lower price than Eero, but after doing my homework, I decided to spend the extra bucks and go with Eero. I've been using the system for about a month now and I'm quite satisfied with the product. Setup was a breeze and took only a few minutes. One of the units was defective, and died shortly after setup. Upon calling support, I was delighted to have the phone answered on the second ring by a real human being who was knowledgeable, and spoke English. He immediately had a new unit shipped out. While waiting for its arrival, I set up with the remaining two units, and found they were adequate to cover my entire 4,500 square foot house! Now, with three units going, I have great coverage in every nook and cranny, and the signal has not dropped once. It works flawlessly, and invisibly. I dropped one star only because the bottoms of the units seem to run warm, although thus far  it hasn't  affected performance. ",
"Computer Geek","November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"Absolutely excellent technology.  We were using a high-end router and 3 extenders in an effort to obtain consistent speeds.  The install is easy and the app is very well-designed.  We have as many as 25 connected devices including computers, tablets, TVs, Amazon Echos (5 of them!), Ring doorbells & cameras, Hue lights, WEMO switches etc. and the network is rock solid.  There is no more yelling from our son's area in the far end of the house.  Note we have a house with older and probably odd construction so even line-of-sight from the old router wasn't working too well.  As I write this we are getting 109 down Mbps / 12 up.  The most I've noticed is 115 down.  No more daily router reboots from the cable modem in fact I haven't rebooted them at all since installation.  Netflix performance is very much improved and rarely goes out.  My guess is that the other router was having issues so the connections were varying in speed.  For us Eero is worth every dollar as Internet peace reigns supreme in our home.  Thanks to everyone who wrote real reviews prior to my purchase as they helped me make my purchase decision. ",
kingmi,"February 12, 2017 ",4.0,"Has greatly improved my wifi experience!  I was dubious about this product when I first heard about it. I read five or six reviews and saw their tests and still thought....yeah, I will be wasting money.  The review that changed my mind was someone that had Comcast, and lived in an older building with the type of walls I do. Reviewer mentioned how this improved the service and does not blame Xfinity for the problems as much as he used to. That intrigued me enough to spend a decent amount of money.    Got the box and had a small issue with setup. While setting up the first unit by the router, there was a failure message after I named the location for it. Stated it could not locate it any more. I tried a few times to figure out how to reset it, before I realized that it was back online and working well.  Not blaming the system for this - minor issue that I easily resolved. Had the whole setup done in 20 mins...and most people would have it done a lot quicker than that.    Here is the con - and the reason for 4 stars. I did email Tech support.  I mentioned in the email that the eero speed test on the computer site was a bad link. (I could test it on my phone, but I really wanted to test it on my laptop in different parts of the apartment.  I also asked if there is a detriment of putting the units too close together.  Some parts of eero stated they should be 40 feet away, but when one of mine wasn't being located that far away, it recommended putting it closer and said 30 feet away. So, I was curious on since I was only using two of the three units, what would be the negatives of having them closer together and using three.  I think it was three or four days later I got a reply that my network speeds are great and they recommend not changing the setup.  That is good info to have, but it didn't answer the two issues.  1) speed test link on their site is not working  2) what is the negative of putting them closer together.  This may seem trivial  and if I could give 4.5 stars, I would...but if I email with questions, I kinda want the answers - especially if the app and site gave two different distances, and the site provides a link that does not work.    Back to positive stuff:  My internet since moving to this apartment and switching to the demon spawn known as Comcast has been horrible. I couldn't watch Netflix at certain times of the day, and even had buffering issues on Youtube. Sometimes basic loading of sites were annoyingly long.  Set up this unit, and have had no buffering issues at all. I am getting the download speeds for the actual internet package I bought.  Very easy set up.  For someone that lives online, and gets most of their entertainment from online, this is a blessing. Even my PS4 has no trouble staying online (with gameplay or even just downloading updates).    The price seems a bit high, but for the situation I am in, and for how much I am online, I am 100% fine with the price of this product. ",

I had trouble getting my Apple Express connected to the Eero system so I could continue to run Airplay.  I got great help from Eero's call center from Nick who talked me through it.  Now my system works seamlessly.  My Apple Express are connected to my Eero Wifi and Apple Airplay works perfectly every time.

"sally A","March 11, 2016 ",4.0,"We own an old house with plaster walls and a small cottage close to the house that we rent out. My son who is in the computer technology business set up commercial extenders  that never extended the wireless consistently up in the cottage. Albeit it was older technology but still should have worked. Finally after so many complaints from renters I asked him to please figure this out. So he bought the 3 pack and replaced all the old extenders with the eero's.  It worked like a charm and even extended it into the patio area. Our renters were so excited that they didn't have to sit scrounged by the window trying to pick up a signal. We have had it now 6 weeks without any complaints. I like the fact that you can tell on your phone which eero is down. All I had to do was u plug it and replug. Came right  back up online. So far  so good . Love it. Definitely would recommend it to anyone who needs extenders or who have plaster walls. ",

One of the systems was an Airport Time Capsule with an additional Airport Express set up as a bridge.  The eero is providing superior coverage and I have no issues with streaming video programs.  It's a great investment--set it up and forget it.  Very easy to provide guest access.  You can text them an invitation message provided by the eero app with the password. ",
"Joshua Cooper","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"Full speed wi-fi all throughout my 4400 sq foot, one story house - what more can I say?  I used to fight having multiple wi-fi endpoints, and the best speed I could hope for was usually about 10 Mbps.  Coverage was non-existent in the farthest bedrooms, now a speedtest from my phone, from the furthest wifi, shows 108Mbps download, which is my full Internet throughput, at the far corner of the house where it would never connect before.  Handoff between devices as you move through the house is seamless, before, even with the same SSIDs, I'd have to disable and reenable wifi before it would grab the closer device.  All configured very easily through the phone app.  We switched Internet providers while I was out of town, and had to redo the system.  I was able to reset up IP Reservations, port forwarding, etc, from my phone, in 5 minutes, from across the country.  You don't get much easier than that. ",
"Terry L Brown","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I recently moved to a new apartment which separated my living room from my office by another bedroom.  I previously had no problems with my internet in my last place so I figured it must be my router, so I replaced it with one from Apple. Streaming movies was just annoying with buffering every 15 minutes so I added an extender which helped but it still buffered several times a night, and my smart TV was useless.  I was pondering different ways to resolve the problem when I came across the eero on the internet.  I knew I would ultimately spend as much money troubleshooting the problem so I figured why not give it a try. So glad I did, no more buffering and the picture quality alone is worth it.  And my smart TV now responds with my amazon prime streaming.  Absolutely pleased and amazed! ",
"Conner S.","December 5, 2016 ",5.0,"I don't usually review amazon products, but when I do it's because they're flawless. I had the eero system for all of 15 minutes before I had it out of the box and set up. The unboxing experience can only be described as &#34;Apple-Like,&#34; with the box design clearly able to guide the user towards which pieces to take out first without having to read any instructions. After I had downloaded the app, setting up each node took ~4 minutes, for a total of approximately 12 minutes between unplugging my old modem and connecting my devices to the new network. Once the system was set up, the app then proceeded to do a speed test on its own as if to say, &#34;See what you've been missing?&#34;    My entire life it feels like, we have been struggling with sub-par wifi connectivity at the far ends of my house, but no more. In a spot where I would have been lucky to receive 3Mbps down this morning, I now get upwards of 30Mbps, which is actually the speed that we are paying for. Until today, I had been telling my parents it's normal to only get 10% of the bandwidth you were paying for, because it was, but no longer!    So far in my &#60;1hr using the setup, it seems pretty sweet. I'll be sure to update this if I run into any issues after a week. ",
"Curtis E Smith","April 30, 2016 ",5.0,"It's a bit pricy for extremely limited security controls. There is no ability to manage it from any desktop\laptop computer. I strongly disagree with the App only approach to managing the devices, as many people would be more comfortable with a mouse and a full keyboard. The functionality is there, and switching from AP to AP is seamless. Overall it works as advertised, it's easy to setup due to it's lack of feature control. You really can't change anything other than the password and the SSID, so it's nearly impossible to misconfigure. The use of bluetooth for initial configuration is pretty intelligent, and made it much easier than trying to connect to the default IP address. There are no mounting brackets, so it needs to be placed on the floor or a shelf. PoE would be a nice feature, as getting the right length and hiding cat cable is much easier than dealing with a power cable.    Overall I think the product is really good at it's intended purpose, which is to extend a wireless network beyond a single AP. Do it so that anyone can set it up, and have it work. They have covered those objectives. I think for the price they are charging, they could have added some additional management, and the ability to properly place\hide them in the home. Beyond WiFi that works, I really don't want to see the devices. ",
"Mark C.","July 3, 2016 ",5.0,"I truly labored over which home wifi mesh system to buy.  I heavily researched Eero, Google Wifi, Plume, Amplifi, and Orbi.  I thoroughly changed my mind several times but never felt completely decided.  I liked Eero from the start, but was put off by the price.  Would have gone with Google Wifi but the performance didn't measure up.  Amplifi was an early pick but ultimately the unsightly style of the remote antenna turned me away.  And despite Orbi's superior speed, those things are HUGE to leave sitting out on the table.  Ultimately I was sold by Eero's amazing commitment to service, support, and features.  The latest 2.0 firmware upgrade has seen significant performance improvements.    We have a central column in the middle of our townhouse with plumbing, AC, walls, etc. that notoriously blocked the central upstairs' wifi signal to much of the downstairs.  Where we did get signal it was degraded and slow.  Out of the box last night I had the first device up and connected via the app in under 10 minutes.

"George P. Burdell","July 5, 2016 ",4.0,"Over the past decade, I've tried various WiFi gear from most of the well known major network device manufacturers to create an extended home WiFi network. In almost every case, the setup was usually problematic requiring multiple attempts to get everything configured.  Then, once everything was set up, I was still left lacking with spotty dead zones.  Thereafter, I could pretty much count on one or more of the extended WiFi nodes to stop responding periodically, thus requiring either a reboot or worst case a reset and completely starting over with reconfiguring it.  Ugh!  What a hassle!  In the end, the best case scenario I had was 3 or 4 individual extended WiFi networks that I had to connect / disconnect between as I roamed throughout my home, each time experiencing a network bandwidth speed cut in half as result of extending the network.  Bleeh!    Then about a year ago, while searching for a better solution, I heard about the upcoming release of eero, a new WiFi based on mesh technology. Since then, I have been anxiously awaiting for the product release. When I finally received it, I couldn't believe how simple the setup was. It was so brain dead easy. Within 30 minutes, I had replaced my problematic, multiple WiFi networks with a single, consolidated WiFi network. It's been  Now, I don't even think about my WiFi.

As the Direct TV guy was setting up the sets we could not get them connected to my home Comcast router even though it was nearby and had a tested 30Mbps download speed.  Just as we were struggling to get connected the doorbell rang and my Eero three pack showed up from Amazon.  Speed was of the essence so I looked at the directions and went to work.  In less than 10 minutes I set up the three units - number one attached to the Comcast cable modem,  number two downstairs and number three on the main floor.  I downloaded the Eero app and bingo the network was visible on my phone and iPad.  I gave it a name and a password and then tried the TVs again.  Bot immediately connected.  Not only that, but I could even stream 4K on demand programs right away.  Now the entire house has a very strong signal (there are three floors but I didn't even have to put one upstairs).

I have seamless, fast, rock-solid coverage throughout my house. It was very easy to set up, and the app is understandable. eero is lightyears ahead of anything else. I was reminded of this again yesterday when I set up a Belkin wifi in my daughter's dorm room (I had to go with one of the access points &#34;recommended&#34; by the university).    When I got home from taking my daughter back to school yesterday, the electricity went out at our house, reminding me of another advantage of the eero. In the past, with the Airport Time Capsule, the electricity would go out. When it came back, I would have to go into my office and restart components in the right order to get them to come back up. This often took 30 minutes or so. Not yesterday. When the system went down, I received an email. When it came back up, it took about 3 minutes or so, but it all reset itself so that we were back on line.

Getting a reasonable signal from where the UVerse Service was installed to the other end of the condo was only possible with repeaters that created new wifi networks.  My wife and guests hated changing networks depending on where you were in the condo.  Eero not only solved this, but the throughput is much higher than the repeaters I tried.

N.T.,"September 4, 2016 ",5.0,"As the tech guy in my family, I have spent many, many years being the recipient of nonstop complaints about how bad the internet is in the apartment my parents live in. They have an account with Comcast and are signed up for the 150MB/s service. With the Motorola box provided from Comcast, even in non-peak hours, the fastest speeds I could get were about 40-60 MB/s download. Now, the real struggle begins when you take into consideration the layout of the apartment. When the apartment was designed in the 80s, the designer decided it would be a nice idea to put mirrors on almost every wall in the apartment. As many of you may know, a mirror will absolutely obliterate a Wi-Fi signal - now imagine a 4,000-square foot apartment full of mirrored walls... Needless to say I've had my hands full on every visit to them. Iâ€™ve tried EVERY solution in the books and up until now nothing has worked. Itâ€™s been a nightmare.    Then comes along Eero... Let me say - what a LIFE CHANGER. First off, putting the Comcast modem / router combo device into bridged mode and setting up that first Eero box literally DOUBLED the wireless speed. My speedtest results went from the above mentioned to a consistent 110-130 MB/s. HUGE improvement. And then I proceeded to install the other 2 Eero units in a couple key locations across the apartment and the results are astonishing. In my mother's workspace, the wireless speeds were about 5-10 MB/s and the signal would quite often drop completely interrupting downloads and whatever else with the old setup. After getting the Eero system set up, she was getting a consistent 90MB/s download with not even a hint of instability. Thatâ€™s over 90 linear feet from the main Eero box through 2 fully mirrored wallsâ€¦ I mean, what is this wizardry?    I will say that this solution is expensive, and certainly not for everyone. But if you have any of the unusual issues that prevent traditional Wi-Fi setups like I have had, you literally donâ€™t have to look elsewhere. Eero is a game changer, and has literally revolutionized my parentâ€™s existence. My hat is off to the team behind this product. Bravo. ",
Snickerdoodle,"August 21, 2016 ",5.0,"Internet connectivity and wireless network performance was a chronic problem in my house.  This was the solution.  It was simple to set up and provides trouble free connectivity.  I use one unit per floor in a three story house with a mix of wired and wireless connections.

However if you want to locate them in a cabinet you will need to take measures to avoid overheating.  I put rubber feet on the units to increase ground clearance and drilled some discreet ventilation holes in the cabinet. Note that the overheated unit stopped working but did not appear to suffer any permanent damage.

Also works perfectly with lots of devices like DLink Wi-Fi camera, Smart TVs, and printers. The only small downside is lack of WPS. ",
"R. Duncan","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I gotta admit I was a bit skeptical but the Eero is everything it's hyped to be and more. We have an older home with robust construction and a cable-modem router in a closet surrounded by thick walls, so the wifi coverage has always been a bit spotty. A four-Eero mesh definitively fixed that. And the Eero management app on the iPhone is a work of art. Best network software I've ever used. Bam! Oh yeah, it's expensive. But worth it. ",
"Ed Merrill","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"This is the first time that WIFI has ever worked the way it should in our home! We can now stream at least four different Youtube videos anywhere in our home while having several people doing whatever they need to do on the Internet at the same time without any buffering issues or any slow down. I was nervous about setting it up as we use Apple's Time Capsule to back up multiple computers, however, the Eero's tech who guided me through the set-up process made it effortless. (I had told him that I have difficulty screwing in a light bulb. He told me that he was 100% confident that he would make the set-up painless. I told him that I was a math teacher and that I knew what 100% meant. We got started. And we finished just as he promised, effortlessly.) We ended up getting a fourth Eero as our home is four stories tall. We have had Eero for two months and have recommended it to friends. All are VERY happy with Eero. We are beyond thrilled with this product!!! ",

"Computer Geek","April 23, 2016 ",5.0,"Absolutely excellent technology.  We were using a high-end router and 3 extenders in an effort to obtain consistent speeds.  The install is easy and the app is very well-designed.  We have as many as 25 connected devices including computers, tablets, TVs, Amazon Echos (5 of them!), Ring doorbells & cameras, Hue lights, WEMO switches etc. and the network is rock solid.  There is no more yelling from our son's area in the far end of the house.  Note we have a house with older and probably odd construction so even line-of-sight from the old router wasn't working too well.  As I write this we are getting 109 down Mbps / 12 up.  The most I've noticed is 115 down.  No more daily router reboots from the cable modem in fact I haven't rebooted them at all since installation.  Netflix performance is very much improved and rarely goes out.  My guess is that the other router was having issues so the connections were varying in speed.  For us Eero is worth every dollar as Internet peace reigns supreme in our home.  Thanks to everyone who wrote real reviews prior to my purchase as they helped me make my purchase decision. ",
"Joe Consumer","August 13, 2016 ",4.0,"We were on the verge of buying another netgear extender for $100 until I heard a blurb on NPR from a reporter talking about ideal Christmas gifts.  The NPR reporter mentioned the eero as her ideal wish list item.  After a bit of research and understanding how eero technology is much more effective at extending wi-fi versus traditional extenders, I decided to purchase the eero two-pack for our two-story, 1,900 sqft home.  The result:  we now get steady wi-fi in our second story back office versus before we had a netgear extender which could not reach the office.  After a month of enjoying the two-pack eero, we got greedy and purchased a third eero unit to amp up wi-fi speed in the upstairs office.  The third unit is the cherry and we are super happy with being able to use our upstairs office instead of camping out in the living room close to the router.    ALSO a side note - when deactivating the router function in our internet service provider's modem and activating the eero router function, I reached out to Spectrum/Time Warner for help. Big kudos to Spectrum/Time Warner for already having knowledge on how to redirect the router from the Spectrum modem to the eero device. ",
"Retired Engr","February 20, 2017 ",5.0,"I have a 3 story condo and my wi fi wasn't reaching from the bottom to top floor.  I had tried a range extender and, while it allowed me to get an adequate signal where I added the extender, there were still a number of weak spots plus my devices wouldn't always change networks properly.  I read all the reviews on the eero system and finally decided to give it a try.  Most of the reviews I read have already hit the high points.  The 3 devices come well packaged and appear to be robustly built with a good quality finish.  I didn't have any issues setting up the devices using my iPhone; I was up and running in less than 30 minutes.  My signal strength/download rates were improved significantly throughout the house and now there is no need to switch networks since the mesh approach makes the devices look like one network.  After installation, I wanted to move one of the devices for improved coverage; so sent a test to eeros to make sure I knew how.  The response came shortly and it turned out you just unplug the device from its current location and plug it in in the new location; everything synchs up automatically.  I've been running for a couple of months now and everything is still working great.  I definitely would recommend this product. ",
"Chef Jean","January 19, 2017 ",5.0,"Can't say enough about Eero. We were on our last leg with our wi-fi. We live in a big home and our wi-fi signal was very weak in many rooms, including our family room. Most of the time our apple tv wouldn't work. We got Eero due to its glowing reviews and we figured if we weren't happy, we'd spring for the second modem. Eero was so easy to set up. We have three units and they are more than enough for our house, yard, garage to have full signal. So happy, I love this start up, they make a great product. ",

This is an awesome product that solved those problems for me.  I had one question during setup about how to change the default IP range (so that existing devices on my network with static IP addresses did not have to be reconfigured).  My call to tech support was answered by a knowledgeable onshore respresentative, on a SATURDAY. ",
Folkmeister,"July 28, 2016 ",5.0,"It works great. It was simple to setup. Just put a little thought about where you place the base units. They are supposed to be in line of sight from one another, but just not being too far apart (15 feet?) is sufficient. The three I have downstairs blanket the upstairs with WiFi now, where most of the rooms would fall short in the past. If I had a problem, I'd move a base unit upstairs.    I have tried all manner of routers like the Nighthawk and other high powered single routers. I am done buying more routers. I'm sticking with this Eero.    If your house is really big,  you may want to buy extra base stations. It's not magic, but it's definitely a better setup than any single router solution I've experienced. ",
ianoid,"March 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I can make this review very simple. The Eero system works. Well.  We have a sprawling house, and attempts to use either a single router, or a router with extenders, never worked well.  Setting up the Eero was easy, and over six months of use, we've never had to even think about the wifi routers.  What could be better?  It even reaches a gazebo we have in the back yard.  Highly recommended if simplicity and consistent utility are the primary goals.  I can't speak to whether I could find a faster router system, but several rounds of expensive routers before the Eero did not work as well in covering the entire house. ",

Tom,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"The detectors are great. They work as advertised and are easily monitored and controlloed from my cell phone.    The setup is where they could have done better. I bought 5 of these and wanted them all to be interconected. They are and it works great. However, they fail to tell you that you have to activate each detector in the chain when seting up a new one. Even the scond and third from the original three pack. When setting these up, after activating it it tells you to go ahead and install it. If you do you will have to get it and activate it for the setup of the new detector to complete. I had to have all four in the chain going when I set up the fifth.    So, If you're installing more than one of these. Sit at a table and do all the setup at once while your comfortable. I would have rate these five stars, but I think this is a VERY MAJOR flaw in the set up. I don't believe they're unaware of the problem, so there doing this on purpose.

"Greg Cooper","October 25, 2016 ",4.0,"I had huge doubts when I began to set these up because the second one I tried to setup was struggling to connect to the first. I did a little reading and they suggest keeping them within line-of-sight of one another. This isn't really possible in my apartment unless I owned maybe 8 or 9 of them and then it would just be an apartment covered in eeros and plugs, not something I want. Fortunately, I was able to position it just outside of line-of-sight and was able to get them to connect. The following morning, however, they had disconnected from one another again which got me insanely worried but they did reconnect without me doing anything other than restarting the first one.    However, since that initial hiccup, it has been unbelievably good. I was previously running a Netgear Nighthawk C7000 and an R7000 (separately across months) and both failed miserably. Neither of these routers are particularly cheap either which made it all the more annoying. My best speed with the R7000, which was the router I was using before switching to eeros, was maxing out at about 190 Mbps in the room where it was located. The speed instantly rocketed up to 290 Mbps which is faster than I'm actually paying for, no one tell Comcast.    I purposefully get a WiFi spot check in various rooms before making the switch so I could get an accurate read out on whether or not the eeros actually improved my network reliability or speed. Here's some of the changes averaged out across 3 tests lasting 10 seconds each (rooms with an eero in them have been marked as such):    Living room (eero): 190 Mbps to 290 Mbps  Kitchen: 110 Mbps to 200 Mbps  Bathroom: 75 Mbps to 145 Mbps  Master bedroom (eero): 15 Mbps to 120 Mbps (the original speed was actually a major reason I looked into eeros)  Second bedroom: 45 Mbps to 150 Mbps    (The remaining eero is located in my hallway, which I never tested before hand)    On top of the speed improvements, it also allowed me to wire in certain devices which have rather poor connections regardless of WiFi speed such as a PS4, Roku, and Apple TV. A major improvement was the reliability of my Philips Hue box. Since I could now put it in a more reasonable location than my living room (which had no bulbs in it), I'm now able to use my Hue bulbs very consistently without bulbs disconnecting from the box.    I've been raving about these to friends and family like crazy and I plan to purchase another three to really create a ridiculous home network with an eero in my second bedroom, kitchen, and maybe at the opposite end of my hallway (I have an T shaped hallway). You should buy! ",
"Amazon Customer","August 13, 2016 ",4.0,"I live in San Francisco in an old 1906 home. Wifi has always been an issue in this house. I had come to accept that I would not get internet in some areas of the house which seems so weird in San Francisco.  I'm glad my friends recommended eero even though at first I did not believe the hype. Once purchased, the set up of the 3 pack eero system took about 10 minutes. I placed them in three locations on three different floors of my house- ground floor, kitchen (1st floor), and the living room on the 2nd floor. Immediately (well after the system boots up) I had a stronger wifi connection in all the areas where I was previously able to connect to the internet. Additionally I now have internet in all the areas where I literally could not even open a web page before. Upload and download speeds are much faster. Love it so far! ",
"Reed H","July 21, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought a 3 pack as a Christmas/House warming gift for my son who just moved into a 3 story home and was hoping he already had a good system for their new home and I would be able to keep the eero.  No such luck as he hooked it up in no time and was excited about the speed and that it found his nest thermostat and smoke detectors.  They also have a studio living space above their detached garage that they will rent out and promised all utilities and didn't have a solution for wifi.  This solved that issue.    That night in the guest bedroom on the third floor I tried a speed test and only registered 4.44 download and 1.45 upload. I wasn't impressed until I realized I was on their old wifi.  I switched to the eero network a minute later and registered 119.69 download and 6.20 upload.  He is on Xfinity cable.    So I had to get one for myself for our three story  home  with basement and lathe and plaster walls.  I no longer have to hold my iPad up in the air, pointing to the door if I try to read email in bed!  My download speeds there went from 3.5 to 89.4.  I'm also on cable.    I did have a little trouble setting it up and called their support on New Year's Eve in the morning and they didn't give me a bad time when I figured out that I hadn't screwed the cable into the modem properly as it was merely dangling like chad on a Florida ballot!  I was up and running right away!    Get the full use of your internet speed!! ",
Lorac,"May 24, 2016 ",5.0,"The eero has changed everything in our household.  We have a 5,000 square foot home with 3 floors to cover.  The house is long and the cable modem and old router were in the office at the furthest end of the house.  We used high-quality updated routers with after-market antennas yet we still could not keep a decent enough signal at the opposite end of the main floor to run a webcam in the dining room (furthest point from router in office).  In addition we couldn't get adequate signal upstairs or in the basement.  With 10 ft. ceilings it made the distance to upstairs even further.  In the basement only one room directly under the router could get a decent signal.  eero has changed everything for us with respect to multiple dead zones and signal strength.  We used a 3-pack of EERO on the main floor only.  One where the old router was located at one end of the house, another in near the middle of the main floor and the third at the other end (dining room) of the main floor.  The signal strength is so good now we can use any wireless device, including phones, cameras, Hue lights and computers consistently on the main floor.  But.... what we didn't necessarily expect is that with these 3 units spread across the main floor the signal strength is good enough to cover the entire second floor as well as the entire basement.  I checked all areas using the WiFi Analyzer app on my android phone.  We even have signal strength in the garage to install a wifi security camera there as well.  Now we can use an iPad in the basement living room.  We can use any device in the bedrooms upstairs.  This product is extremely easy to set-up.  All you do is plug the first one in and do what your phone app tells you to do to set up the other two units.  It helps you place them appropriately.  We aren't using all features yet, but we plan to give priority to our OOMA voip telephone (also connected via wifi) so voice traffic gets priority over other traffic.  The units look nice on top of furniture or a desk.  I highly recommend an eero 3-pack for large homes! ",
DukMan,"January 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I find this to be a great product. While I am not a system engineer, I am slightly 'techie' and was in need of a new router and this was recommended to me by my son. I did the research and felt this would meet my needs. My two previous routers never delivered the speed or the coverage, in fact one was 2 months old and I was very upset with the 'over promise and under deliver'. The EERO has been an absolute winner from the minute I installed it.    The setup was very easy. I did need to call support and it was very helpful and I was up and running in 30 minutes. The speed is fantastic and I have double the coverage from previous. I just can't imagine how it could be easier or better than the experience I have had so far. ",
rosenkav1,"July 18, 2016 ",5.0,"Overall, I enjoyed a very easy, snag-free installation process with Eero.  I also bought the 3-Eero pack and a new modem at the same time.  I don't know how much of the improvement to internet speed over wifi that I've enjoyed since installing both can be credited to Eero versus the new modem or the combination of the two, but we do seem to have far better speed and coverage throughout our house.  We do not pay for business-class service through our cable provider, just a slightly upgraded conventional service, but before installing Eero, my internet connection in my office upstairs was slow as molasses -- online speed tests showed download speeds of anywhere from 2 to 6 Mbps, and now I'm consistently around 50 Mbps, according to the Eero app.  We've had only the occasional hiccup with streaming music or video entertainment with the new setup, most of which we do in the upstairs areas of our house.  My only gripe, and it's no fault of the Eero, is that I had to reinstall all three of our Nest smoke detectors after setup, which required pulling them out of the ceiling and resetting them all.  At least climbing up and down the ladder all those times made for some good exercise. ",

When I moved I purchased a 75MB service.  The best service I could get from the old routers inside the house was 29MB.  After hearing about EERO on the podcast IOS Today I started reading the reviews for the EERO over several weeks I finally decided to purchase the 3 pack.  It was amazing how easy it  was to install the three units.  I did not have any probems getting them up and running. The modem is down in the basement so the first EERO is down there next to the modem.. The next one is on the main level in the middle of the house to the front of the house in the office.  The third one is about 30 feet away from the one in the basement but on the main level on the back side of the house.  Coverage is fantastic inside the house, the garage  and out in the front yard and back yard!  I now receive the 75MB that I am paying for and have great coverage everywhere!

"Michael Brown","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"Very happy customer here!  I first heard of the eero system from the Cult of Mac podcast (if you're an Apple fan and haven't heard it yet, I highly suggest you give it a go).  One of the podcasters was raving about how the eero had massively improved the wifi coverage in his home, and I was instantly intrigued.  My house is about 1,300 square feet and the modem sits in one corner while the Apple TV sits in the diagonally opposite corner.  Before eero, shows on Netflix, Amazon, etc. would constantly pause to buffer, which of course can be quite frustrating.  The price tag for the three-pack eero system is a hefty one, no denying that, but I justified the purchase because I had some Amazon gift cards that covered half of the cost...and I'm very glad I made that purchase!  Setup was so easy: download the app to your phone and it walks you through in a matter of minutes.  It's suggested that you place your eero devices within sight of each other, but the physical structure of my house makes that impossible.  I have one in each opposite corner, plus one in the hallway in the middle of the house.  It works perfectly!  I will note that the first day I used the system, I noticed a couple of times the blinking light on the devices that indicated loss of connectivity.  However, during that first night the system did its initial software update (so cool that it does it on its own!), and ever since then it's been running flawlessly.  Strong wifi signal throughout the house, zero loss of connectivity, zero spontaneous Netflix bufferings.  If you can swallow the cost of the device, stop thinking about it and just buy it! ",
"Erin Souza","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Amazing product - so easy to set up and understand. Unlike an extender which basically just screws with your Sonos and doesn't actually provide an extension of usable wifi - EERO actually broadened my wifi capability.

Strong enough bandwidth for our family members staying over to watch Netflix and/or hold video conferences from their cottage.

Srinivasa,"August 9, 2016 ",5.0,"My home is split over 3 levels. I have a 300 mbps connection which I could never receive reliably or at any significant speed down in the basement. After trying out numerous alternatives (routers, access points, extenders, and power line adapters), I stumbled on eero. I now have 4 of them spread over the house and get the expected 300 mbps from anywhere the house. An expensive proposition at $600 for 4 units -- but boy -- has it been worth it !!    The installation process is super slick and I can see that this will be how setup applications will be in the future -- with a fancy app that guides you at every step and knows what you are doing. A couple of weeks or so after I had installed the eero units, I decided to turn off the WIFI on the router provided by the cable company. This actually improved the performance and reliability of the entire eero system and I suggest everyone do this.    One odd thing that I have noticed is that if the internet connection goes down, the eero that is connected to the router gets very hot. I mean really HOT -- and it may be something the eero folks need to worry about -- perhaps some venting slits in the side or the top of the unit may be required to prevent damage to the unit if the internet connection goes down for extended periods of time.    Apart from this observation regarding an edge condition -- I think the eero is a game changer and a truly amazing product. ",
"Ariel Benzakein","March 31, 2016 ",5.0,"I replaced an Amplifi HD with a 3 eero setup because the Amplifi HD only supports 30 wireless devices (I have 35 now and will be adding more for home automation) and the eero supports up to 128.  I have FiOS 500 up/500 down, so there is plenty of bandwidth to support everything.  The eero is pretty easy to set up - all plug & play; the trick is in positioning the satellite systems in optimal locations.  My house is about 3400 sq ft and I now have solid WIFI everywhere.  I found the throughput to be a lot better on the Amplfii, but the eero is pretty good too (nothing below 120 down in any corner of my house, which is certainly fast enough). ",
"David Aldis","August 29, 2016 ",5.0,"I have to start by stating that I'm using this in Europe, which right now is not the intended market for the Eero. To register the device you have to enter a US cell number , even though it's unnecessary. The power brick is universal voltage, but apparently using it on 240v voids the warranty.  All that aside, it works really well in my very old stone house with very thick walls. We don't have a great internet speed so that hasn't improved, but the internal coverage and transfer speeds have gone up quite dramatically. I used to use powerline adapters, but Eero beats those into the ground.  It's very easy to set up too, notwithstanding the registration issue. My mum could probably do it.  So, expensive, but a good system. ",

"Mark C.","October 3, 2016 ",5.0,"I truly labored over which home wifi mesh system to buy.  I heavily researched Eero, Google Wifi, Plume, Amplifi, and Orbi.  I thoroughly changed my mind several times but never felt completely decided.  I liked Eero from the start, but was put off by the price.  Would have gone with Google Wifi but the performance didn't measure up.  Amplifi was an early pick but ultimately the unsightly style of the remote antenna turned me away.  And despite Orbi's superior speed, those things are HUGE to leave sitting out on the table.  Ultimately I was sold by Eero's amazing commitment to service, support, and features.  The latest 2.0 firmware upgrade has seen significant performance improvements.    We have a central column in the middle of our townhouse with plumbing, AC, walls, etc. that notoriously blocked the central upstairs' wifi signal to much of the downstairs.  Where we did get signal it was degraded and slow.  Out of the box last night I had the first device up and connected via the app in under 10 minutes.

"Eric Z.","March 24, 2016 ",5.0,"My wife and I have an older, all masonry house with an addition that we occupy a great deal of the time. I mention this as that was our challenge. Location of a singular router could never satisfy seamless WiFi through out the structure. If we located router in the original structure, the newer half was shielded by the impenetrable all masonry wall. If we located the router in the newer addition, then vice versa. We knew there was no single unit solution. We also spend a great deal of time in the back yard...some 60 feet from the house.   We do not game, work a home office, and TV or video is limited to watching baseball...a lot of baseball! We are not very savvy with the details required to install our own mesh type system. So we were condemned to creating/buying a solution. We bought the doo dads that were going to boost, stretch, span, and solve all our WiFi woes.  This then that...nope, that didn't work. How about this antenna? No difference. Nothing that could be purchased and simply placed existed to solve our situation. Until Eero.   My wife had run across an article in the paper (crazy, huh? Well, it was the digital version!) discussing Eero. I took a look and read/researched all that I could.  There were some complaints about the cost. It was a stretch, but I figured if it actually worked 50% better than what we had, then it was less money than all we have spent so far on a system that supplies very sub par WiFi!  Before we purchased the Eero, I rather whimsically sent an email to their support including a floor plan our structure and desires from the WiFi system. I nearly fell out of my chair when there was a personal response some 3 hours later! Whoa...people answer support email? Really? It actually contained details of usefulness on where, how, and why to do what.  I responded with another diagram proposing the placement of Eero units. They responded ...AGAIN! OK. I am sold. I will buy this! I purchased a 3 pack. I knew we needed one each in the two halves of the house to cross the original dividing wall. The third I would try on the patio in an attempt to send a signal to the backyard.   We have a combined modem/router that we own. So first challenge was to log into the router and set it for bridge mode. Easy enough. We did have a limited amount of Ethernet CAT5 run through the structure. We set the first Eero (I like to call it the master as it configures things) in the newer half supplied by CAT5 from the bridged modem and then CAT5 downstream to our switch, both in the basement. We had previously downloaded the set up app and BOOM! We had WiFi in that half of the house. A second was placed (wireless) some 30' away in the older half, with signal fairly &#34;line of sight&#34; through a hall. BOOM! That half has WiFi! The third was placed on patio (wireless) and BOOM! The patio is humming! All worked flawlessly. We have some 14 devices being served. Even the Wemo works which had always been a persnickety little device!   The patio installation did not exactly serve the backyard area as we had hoped, but we knew it would be difficult. In an attempt to improve this situation, I had installed a CAT5 cable from the switch in basement to the patio. We &#34;forgot&#34; the patio Eero and moved it to a higher location on patio and plugged it into Ethernet. After it found the network and was all happy, BOOM! We had WiFi in the back yard...some 60' away! Last evening we streamed ball game audio and and MLB highlight videos without buffering or glitches.    We knew that 3 Eero would likely not service all of our structure due to it's dense and awkward arrangement. So yes, I bought another 3 pack! We have not installed the second 3 pack as yet, but suspect these will supply the balance of house...with ease.   To recapitulate:   Eero works. If you would like a very simple network without having to learn all the technical details to build your own, this is it. We now have coverage at speeds that match what we are paying for from our ISP. I read all of Eero's site listing ranges, how to locate, etc. I can confidently and honestly say, it performs better than advertised. The signal is reaching farther than recommended. We  are overwhelmingly happy with our Eero purchase! ",
Jase,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"Our home is not especially large, but we did have trouble with WiFi when using a &#34;top-of-the-line,&#34; conventional wireless router.  With eero, WiFi is as strong in our back yard as it is coming out of the wall.    I had read that I could place my old wireless router in &#34;bridge mode&#34; so that it could simply serve as the required cable modem for my eero.  I was a little worried because I'm not very tech savvy, and that sounded like something could easily go wrong.  So I decided to just forget about bridge mode, and run the eero without disabling the WiFi features of my old router.  In our case, the eero works flawlessly alongside the old router.  Less than 15 minutes to get all three up and running.    The best thing about our WiFi environment with eero is that it just disappears from our daily thoughts.  We just enjoy as much WiFi as we want, wherever we want.    Highest recommendation. ",

CMont,"January 24, 2017 ",5.0,"Very happy with the system after over a month.  Stable connexion, responsive eero support, active user community.  We are an all-Apple 1200  sqft house (1 floor)  and all mobile devices and macs remain connected without interruption.    I also have an Airpot Express directly connected to one eeor for Airplay and it has never disconnected. It plays streaming from a radio-station almost permanently. Before eero, my airport express was on the WIFI with an airpot extreme, and I experienced streaming interruptions at least once every 1 or 2 days.    My tenant upstairs is on my guest network and coverage for him is better and more stable than it was when he was on the airport guest network.    2 of my eeros are wall mounted using &#34;L shape&#34; screws on each corner (see photo). Units seem to work well in that position as well.    Recommended.  (I purchased the Eero units directly from their site after waiting for a competor's new comparable product that took too long to ship.)

Our home is 3600 square feet and we no longer have any dead zones.  The set-up was very fast and a very simple process.  The app walks you through step-by-step.  It is pricey and I had to really think about it before I finally took the plunge and made the purchase and I am glad that I did.  Our only other option was to have wired the house with access points and that option would not have been any less expensive. ",
"K. Cassidy","September 17, 2016 ",5.0,"Was happy initially, but am now having poor internet service throughout the house.  I got good results initially, but recently noticed that my downloads are taking longer, and the family has been complaining about the speed of their applications and games. I was running a system next to the primary eero and modem and did a network speed test.  I then unplugged the eero and plugged the system directly into the cable modem.  As you can see, the test was 20x faster with the direct connection to the modem.  I'll be doing some troubleshooting on this, but for a solution that should be getting faster through automatic updates, this hasn't been the case for me. ",
"eero Support","June 11, 2016 ",5.0,"I don't usually review amazon products, but when I do it's because they're flawless. I had the eero system for all of 15 minutes before I had it out of the box and set up. The unboxing experience can only be described as &#34;Apple-Like,&#34; with the box design clearly able to guide the user towards which pieces to take out first without having to read any instructions. After I had downloaded the app, setting up each node took ~4 minutes, for a total of approximately 12 minutes between unplugging my old modem and connecting my devices to the new network. Once the system was set up, the app then proceeded to do a speed test on its own as if to say, &#34;See what you've been missing?&#34;    My entire life it feels like, we have been struggling with sub-par wifi connectivity at the far ends of my house, but no more. In a spot where I would have been lucky to receive 3Mbps down this morning, I now get upwards of 30Mbps, which is actually the speed that we are paying for. Until today, I had been telling my parents it's normal to only get 10% of the bandwidth you were paying for, because it was, but no longer!    So far in my &#60;1hr using the setup, it seems pretty sweet. I'll be sure to update this if I run into any issues after a week. ",
"Conner S.","September 11, 2016 ",2.0,"In my quest to find the MESH WIFI system that could handle the Gigabit Internet, eero did well.

"Gary D. Donnelly","March 23, 2017 ",4.0,"My Airport Time Capsule got zapped by lighting, making a change necessary. eero has been a major improvement. I have seamless, fast, rock-solid coverage throughout my house. It was very easy to set up, and the app is understandable. eero is lightyears ahead of anything else. I was reminded of this again yesterday when I set up a Belkin wifi in my daughter's dorm room (I had to go with one of the access points &#34;recommended&#34; by the university).    When I got home from taking my daughter back to school yesterday, the electricity went out at our house, reminding me of another advantage of the eero. In the past, with the Airport Time Capsule, the electricity would go out. When it came back, I would have to go into my office and restart components in the right order to get them to come back up. This often took 30 minutes or so. Not yesterday. When the system went down, I received an email. When it came back up, it took about 3 minutes or so, but it all reset itself so that we were back on line.    I didn't like spending $500 to replace the Airport, but there is no question that this system is the best. I would have to say that it has been worth it. ",

I am very technical but I love that, with these, I did not need to be.

"Amazon Customer","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"We were getting tired of basic wifi router with several extenders around the house.  The problem is, if you want to switch to one of the extenders, you have to manually connect.  So we bought the eero system and WOW.  It was easy to set up, I can check the system from my smart phone.  No more having to log into different extenders.    But the true test when my wife's friend and family spent a week with us.  The father works in the IT industry and the oldest boy is studying programing at the University of Washington and always coding.  The youngest boy is 13 and a big gamer.  Eero didn't miss a beat.  At one point there was four laptops, six smart phones using the internet and just to make it interesting, we were streaming a movie for everyone to watch.  No noticeable slowdown in any of our devices.    This was a great investment.  I would highly recommend the eero wifi system ",
"Roger E. Ison","August 22, 2016 ",5.0,"My 3 eeros replaced a custom setup using DD-WRT flashed into a Buffalo router and a bridged Apple router in a large house.  Eero was easiest setup ever. The first day it was somewhat slow, as measured by a couple of test apps running in an iPad Pro. But eeros updated their firmware overnight and the system became progressively faster. Since 3rd day, by far the fastest and most complete coverage I've ever had in the house. So far we've experienced no problems, even with as many as 15 devices connected and 3 streaming simultaneously. Both my iPad Pro and wired PCs regularly report 80 - 90 megabit/sec downloads over a Comcast cable in a somewhat rural location. It's actually a little hard to believe. We have had one extended power failure, and the eero network brought itself back online normally when power was restored.    Eeros do not yet support IPv6, although it is promised as &#34;coming soon&#34;. I'd like to add one more eero to improve coverage in one corner of the lower level of the house (although the existing setup does reach there). However, the per-unit cost of a single additional eero is much higher than the per-unit cost of my set of three.  The manufacturer should offer a better add-on price for existing customers. ",
"Dan Garlington","August 30, 2016 ",5.0,"After two previous failed attempts to resolve the issue of poor WiFi signal in many rooms of our 2000+ square foot home with other products, I was delighted to find that the eero system was quick and easy to set up, and has definitively solved our problem.  Instead of having multiple different logins/passwords as was the case with other products, the eero gave me a single, simple login/password combination throughout the house.  The range from just 3 eero devices is remarkably good and the signal strength has never wavered. ",
"Sebastian Sylvan","August 20, 2016 ",5.0,"This really is a great little product. I can now getÂ 400+ Mbit/s all over my home, whereas before I'd be lucky to break 100.Â   Pros:  * Ethernet jack on everyÂ device. Unlike some of the competitors, this means  you can choose to hard wire some of the eeros for even better speeds (I used a MoCA bridge for this, which runs Ethernet over the existing cable connections inÂ my house).Â Some of the competitors only have an Ethernet jack onÂ a &#34;main&#34; device.  * Simple setup.  * ReliableÂ network thatÂ Just Works. My phone automatically connects to theÂ best network to maximize speed.  * Can be used in &#34;bridge&#34; mode where the Eero's just acts as access points to my existing router.Â     There areÂ  a few downsides:  * Need to make an accountÂ to set up the Eero in the app.  * Needs an app at all. I have an iPhone right now, but I've previously used windowsÂ phone and mightÂ go back to it in the future and the fact that you need either an Android or iOS phoneÂ to do the setup is a bit worrying. I'd prefer if the &#34;app&#34; was just a web page served by the devices, so it could be accessed on any device, including a laptop.  * NoÂ full IPv6 support. Not super critical right now I suppose, but a bit risky that it may not support this for the future (no problem if you use the Eero's in bridge mode though -Â as long as your existing router handles IPv6). This is the one and only reason I kept myÂ existing router rather than just use Eero's for everything.    For me personally it would be a 5 star review if the IPv6 thing gets addressed inÂ a future update because it would mean I could just get rid of my traditional router altogether.Â The other cons are an annoyanceÂ but not enough to dock a star.

Jim,"November 27, 2016 ",5.0,"I had spent hours on the phone with AT&T, NetFlix and Vizio as I repeatedly had viewing issues. Further we had dead spots for WiFi and our home is about 2100 sq ft. I tried Netgear and nothing improved the situation. My son told me to check out EERO. This company, their products are game changing. It is easy to install, app works brilliantly, no more dead spots, no TV issues. We have a guesthouse and were told by AT&T we needed to add service and they said no way to  get WiFi; with eero we have super WiFi. I know this is a pricey product but it works. Their support is awesome (though I only called with questions before I purchased - haven't needed any support post purchase). The 'pods' only need and electric outlet (they come with a nice length cord). The app lets you know if they are properly placed for best results. EERO is a GREAT product! (and a great company)    30-DAY UPDATE - eero still works like a champion. It has solved our dead spot or slow speed areas (only issue remains is AT&T Gigapower still goes out for a couple minutes at a time several times a week and if you are live streaming it is a pain BUT eero gives the TV very high download speed).

"TCB IN A FLASH","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Four months ago I moved into a great pre-war condo in Chicago. The space is great, but the plaster/wire mesh walls KILLED my WiFi signal. I was previously running the latest gen Apple AirPort Extreme and even with another AirPort extreme operating as a repeater, my WiFi signal would not reliably extend across my 2,600 sqft apartment. I tried a few other solutions (more repeaters, moving the AirPort, and powerline WiFi) but nothing helped. I finally resolved to spend $2,500 having my house wired with cat6 cable outlets to spread additional wired routers across my place, but before pulling that trigger I rolled the dice and purchased the eero system. I have Amazon Prime, so I figured worst case I would just return it. No harm, no foul.    SO GLAD I DID!    The system took less than 15 minutes to set up and after just a little trial and error on where to put the devices, I had great WiFi across my place. No dead spots. No skipping video. My problem was just solved.    Thank the WiFi gods!    The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because 1) I do see a drop in overall speed in some areas of my house. Still WAAAAAAY better than before, but not nearly as strong as when I nearer the base station; and 2) the cost. Yes, it's cheaper than re-wiring my house, but $500 is a little high IMHO.

Tom,"January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"The detectors are great. They work as advertised and are easily monitored and controlloed from my cell phone.    The setup is where they could have done better.

"Kevin White","July 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Over the past decade, I've tried various WiFi gear from most of the well known major network device manufacturers to create an extended home WiFi network. In almost every case, the setup was usually problematic requiring multiple attempts to get everything configured.  Then, once everything was set up, I was still left lacking with spotty dead zones.  Thereafter, I could pretty much count on one or more of the extended WiFi nodes to stop responding periodically, thus requiring either a reboot or worst case a reset and completely starting over with reconfiguring it.  Ugh!  What a hassle!  In the end, the best case scenario I had was 3 or 4 individual extended WiFi networks that I had to connect / disconnect between as I roamed throughout my home, each time experiencing a network bandwidth speed cut in half as result of extending the network.  Bleeh!    Then about a year ago, while searching for a better solution, I heard about the upcoming release of eero, a new WiFi based on mesh technology. Since then, I have been anxiously awaiting for the product release. When I finally received it, I couldn't believe how simple the setup was. It was so brain dead easy.

"THE ULTIMATE PIZZA MANUAL Fan","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"NOW THAT ALL THREE ARE WORKING, LOVE IT!  At first, only two of the three-pack worked. The third one wouldn't connect. It was VERY FRUSTRATING. The eero app also said the unit needed upgrading. Spent several hours trying to solve this. Finally, I thought of taking it off the network. Got a message saying that if I did that, it would RESET TO FACTORY DEFAULTS. AH HA!! That fixed it. It subsequently reconnected and we've been getting 60+mbps all over the house and outside as well. (A $255 Linksys WRT1900AC Dual Band Smart Wi-Fi Wireless AC Router (2.4 + 5GHz) *PLUS* a $111 Linksys AC1200 MAX Wi-Fi Range Extender (RE6500) with homemade house wiring. NOW GARBAGE. BOO HOO! But with all that Linksys stuff, we STILL had dead spots, weak/slow wifi, AND VERY COMPLEX LINKSYS-BROWSER-BASED CONFIGURATION. EERO magically eliminates all that hassle and provides extremely high-speed wifi !!) ",
Mrresurface,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Simply amazing.  Easy to set up.  I did need to hard wire my first two eeros to each other.  Going from the main eero downstairs to the others upstairs rendered a weak signal, but hard wiring it was worth it.  I'm getting over 200mb in my past deads spots, such as the master bed room and deck, which makes this purchase worth the money as it works and communicates with itself to keep working and it did not interfere with my TV downstairs I have hard wired to the xfinity modem.  I read of Issues with LUMA having issues with existing hardwired connecitons. ",

"Amazon Customer","April 3, 2017 ",5.0,"I really don't understand what other people are doing wrong in their setup.  I purchased the 3 unit system, since even though I had fast wifi with a Verizon router (their top of the line router as of 2016), with two separate modem spots at opposite ends of the house, I still had dead spots that made no sense to me whatsoever.  My office is above my kitchen, and my wifi would be dropped by every device there, not more than 20 ft from the router.  I understand that this is through the floor... But should at least have decent connectivity.  Furthermore, my xbox was less than 10 feet from my 2nd router, and it would only show 2 or 3 out of 4 bars.  I would also get tons of lag while playing the division.  And to top it off, my TV would drop its connection when streaming movies from my computer.    Needless to say, Verizon was not helpful.  They offered to sell an extender for $99, which didn't make much sense to me since again, the router was only 10 feet away.  So, I turned to eero.  From opening the box to surfing the net, it took roughly 20 minutes.  At first I was worried, since my 100/100 speed was showing up as 40/37.  But after maybe an hour (the instructions say it could take up to 24 hours to optimize) I was at full blast.  Please view the pic as a reference.    The last test was playing on the Xbox.  I hard wired the Xbox to one of my eeros since there were many complaints about signal swapping with them.  the gaming had no lag at all, and I did not notice any sort of drop in connectivity.  Played for about an hour.    This system is super fast, amazingly easy to set up, user friendly and has a decent app to go with it.  i highly recommend this to anyone with dead spot problems in their house. ",
"Tyler Nielsen","June 7, 2016 ",5.0,"This product, other than the price, couldn't be more perfect. Had a 3 year old Belkin router (i know, sad) and needed an upgrade after dealing with buffering from the Apple TVs and overloaded access point from the Canary, Wemos and other smart devices... Took 20 minutes to set up and get things running. Outside the minor glitch of having to update the software on the main hub prior to getting a solid connection on the second eero in the office, it was seamless.    Have nearly a 60% increase in speed, and buffering is non-existent in the apple TVs. Looking forward to loading them up with 30 devices with the inlaws in the coming weeks and seeing the throughput. Love the idea, and after all of my research, glad I chose this instead of the Linksys, Google, Luma or all the other ones.    Highly recommend and would love to see whats coming next. ",

Amazing experience and an amazing product. The after sale tech contact was just thanking eero for engineering such a fantastic product. If you can setup an iPhone you can do eero. Download an app, plugin, enjoy seamless wifi!  Evaluating all the current and new entities into the home mesh network space I easily picked the eero system over others. I do tech all day at work and when I'm home I want to use services and products that enhance my life as transparently as possible. All Mac, all iPhone and an all eero network...it like heaven. Simple and it works everytime I need it to. The eero 3-pack replaced 3 routers in my older home with 13&#34;thick brick walls. Now rather than 5 SSID's and passwords we have 1 continuous zone for the family and 1 super secure guest network. ",

"C. Fries","November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I have tried everything to get a better wifi signal, strength and consistency of both in my house for years. I live in a single story that is a decent size, almost 3,000, so there's a lot of ground to cover (wifi wise). I also have a smart TV in the back yard, so it is actually even bigger ground to cover. At first I tried to improve my wifi changing ISP from AT&T to Time Warner's 300mbps download speed. That didn't improve the wifi-strength to the other side of the house from where the modem was located. Then I tried TP Links along with Netgear range extenders. They helped, but weren't consistent. Some days decent, some days terrible, but never exceptionally good performance, even on their best days. Didn't know what to do, then was recommended Eero. I was skeptical, as nothing had really worked in the past, but I figured I could return it if I was in no better shape. Well, no need for returning. First, the set up was idiot proof. Literally as simple as 1, 2, 3. As close to plug and play as you can get. Now, on to the important part - performance. I was blown away with how strong and how far the signal carried. I was able to stream Netflix on the family room TV and the backyard smart TV, which are located on the other side of the house to the modem, with no buffer, crystal clear picture, and immediate downloading. I was able to use multiple devices simultaneously throughout the house with no loss of strength, and I run a lot of equipment from security cameras, video door bell, multiple TVs, computers, iPads, laptop, iPhones, solar panel monitoring, etc.    This is hands down, the best product for the internet since the invention of the internet. Couldn't be more satisfied! From set up to performance, you will not be disappointed ",
"Clifford A. King","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I tried range extenders and through house power adapters in the past to enhance coverage within my home, but I could not duplicate the data rate coming into my Xfinity modem/router (180 Mbit/s).  I bought the 3-pack and now have extremely good data rates throughout the place (&#62;90 Mbits/s).  It seems to be getting even better after an update last night.  Good job Eero! ",
RLP,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Its not as great as I was expecting it to be. I got the 3 pack and set them up as directed in the app which was pretty easy to do. It also does provide whole house coverage and we don't have problems with loosing connection to the wifi like we use to. Setup and whole house coverage are two features it does very well.    Here is where I am disappointed, the wifi signal is not as strong the further away you get from the main one like they advertise. I have a 150mbps plan with Comcast. The main hub that is connected to the modem, when I am near that one I have no problem getting the 150+. As I get to the furtherest one upstairs, my speed tests go down to anywhere from 50mbps to maybe 80mbps at most.    Second thing is the app is very lacking in features. First off, I previously had the Google Onhub and that app had great features such as telling me how much data a specific connected device used and you could even change the timeframe to see different lengths of times. Eero app does not have this feature. Second thing is the speed test feature inside the Eero app is worthless. I will use speedtest.net app and get 150mbps result, go straight to the Eero app and get 80mp if I'm lucky. Sometimes the Eero app will do a speed test and tell me 15mbps.    I am most likely returning these as the price tag is just way to high for something with less features than other routers and doesn't provide reliable speeds throughout the house. ",

Amazon delivered in a day and, as advertised set up was virtually automatic.  The 3 eero's automatically found each other once telling them a network name and pw.  It found all 12 of our networked devices and seamlessly set them up.  Up and going in under 10 minutes.  And, no more signal dropouts; even from the far end of the house.

"Neil D Overholtz","June 5, 2016 ",5.0,"Bought this is addition to a new surfboard modem to increase access and speed to the internet. Was running several standard wireless devices and was seeing issues. Router and modem were due for upgrade.  Surfboard modem 32 channel is awesome and locked right in, full bandwidth, no problem.  Had a little trouble getting eero up, but once completed locked right in, again seeing full bandwidth.  Well 2 months later, the system is showing some really weird issues and it seems to have started with upgrades to the devices.  TVs will drop connectivity every once on a while and worse yet, all of the laptops in the house are having wireless connection issues.  They work in other environments (libraries, colleges, Panera, etc.) on those wireless networks, but don't work in my 3 unit home eero environment, no matter what location within the house.  Having a single device not work is one thing.  Having sporatic connection problems and 4 laptops not working is another.  Can get wired to work, but wireless is out, so what is the point.  I really had high hopes for this setup and was really excited about the technology.  Very disappointed. ",
"James T.","February 6, 2017 ",5.0,"Without a doubt, the coolest piece of technology I've ever purchased. I was a little skeptical about this working so well due to the fact I was trying to setup in a 3 story older house and had previously 0 luck getting a TP-LINKAV500 powerline network running, however after so many good reviews, I figured I'd give Eero a shot.    Within 20 minutes, I had everything completely setup. All 3 floors had fully working wifi, getting anywhere between 95-99% of the bandwidth I'm paying for from our ISP. The app breaks every part of the install down step-by-step makes everything extremely easy to start and monitor on an on-going basis. Honestly, the price seems a little steep at first, but after getting everything running so smoothly, I have no buyer's remorse whatsoever. ",

The 1st connects to my model. The 2nd, 3rd connect wirelessly. Then I connect my old Airport Extreme with 2nd eero.    I use iMac, two MacBook pro, iPhone, and iPad mini to test speed around 3rd eero. Only one of my MacBook Pro can get up to 70Mb speed around 3nd eero. All other devices can only get up to 40Mb speed. Especialy iMac, only get speed around 15Mb. But when I connect to my Airport Extreme (which connects to 2nd eero). I can get full speed (80Mb) for all my devices.    One more thing, it doesn't support IPv6!!!!!!    You spend $500 in 2016 to get the high-end wifi device that doesn't support IPv6 YET?    If you really need an easy setup wifi devices.

Bill,"February 2, 2017 ",3.0,"This is simply an exceptional product.  In summary, it was relatively easy to set up and provides strong, fast coverage across my home.      Prior to installing, download the app and set your phone to cellular with bluetooth on (turn off wifi on your phone).  Follow directions setting up the base device (I believe they are exactly the same but I will refer to the 1st device as the base).  You might want to conduct a software update at this time but I'm not sure it really matters.  Let the app lead you thru the set up of your satellite devices which should be line of sight and 40 feet or so away.  I did run into problems with the second phase as I was experiencing a bluetooth glitch.  I eventually called tech support which was fantastic!  They quickly answered and solved the issue.  The completion of the set up was a breeze from that point on.  I was told that this wasn't a common issue but its nice to know that the support line was this good.    I was working off of an Apple time capsule prior to installing the Eero device and it lost coverage and speed across the my house.  The difference is simply striking!  I could average 5 - 20 Mbs download depending upon the room I was in except for the extreme points in the house where is was a crap shot as to signal.  Now my coverage is 25 - 40 Mbs in the far reaches of my home.  Note: the Eero app seems to test your potential speed not the actual speed (it seems to regularly give 60Mbs as metric).  So I was using another speed test.    Again, simply a fantastic purchase and I am very happy with it across the board ",

In regards to the Airport Extreme, I am still able to use Apple's time machine through EERO's system connected to the Airport but with the Airport's WiFi turned off as to not interfere with the EERO WiFi.

Also the family controls, which I easily can tune even when not at home.    I've gone through various different configurations during the last 5 years and ended up with decent coverage in 90% of one of my homes using two wi-fi routers and one repeater. In my other home there are two houses about 100 ft apart, which where connected using a wi-fi extender that gave a very weak connection in the second home.    I bought 3 eero for each of my homes and got great coverage everywhere!    The biggest advantage is that the setup was a breeze!    Just getting the simple setup and remote management, makes me recommend eero even for smaller homes where only one is needed.    The two downsides I've found are that a US phone is currently needed (one of my homes is in Europe) and the dependency on the Eero cloud. ",

"R. Duncan","July 31, 2016 ",5.0,"I gotta admit I was a bit skeptical but the Eero is everything it's hyped to be and more. We have an older home with robust construction and a cable-modem router in a closet surrounded by thick walls, so the wifi coverage has always been a bit spotty. A four-Eero mesh definitively fixed that. And the Eero management app on the iPhone is a work of art. Best network software I've ever used. Bam! Oh yeah, it's expensive. But worth it. ",
Danu,"March 5, 2017 ",4.0,"Excellent Product, Excellent Customer Service, the only reason I gave it a four star is because if the internet is down and power cycles to eero it looses local connection. Local Network is not functional and that is a big concern as none of other routers I have used does that as the local network keeps working. This really needs to be fixed as is a major bug. Will wait to see if it gets fixed soon or will have to move back to my older router as much as would like to keep using this. ",
"Kent W Dayton","January 1, 2017 ",5.0,"Before Eero my house was plagued by a terrible wifi signal, from which my phone would randomly disconnect, with which my tv communicated only sporadicly, and whose speed was only bearable while within a few feet of the router. (And this was apple's latest $200 router.)    Installation was like having coffee with an old friend, only it took less time. In minutes my entire 3000sf house was bathed in sweet, beautiful, fast, reliable wifi.    The app is beautifully designed and perfectly functional. Have a look at apple's &#34;wifi utility&#34; if you want to know what bad app design looks like and why it matters. To me eero--apple feels like Tesla--GMC.    Oh, AND it's nice looking!

"Florida Bill","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I e gone through different levels of wifi systems only to still have dead spots around the house. The eero system is beyond amazing! Not a single dead spot including backyard pool area or sitting in front porch. The signal is super strong everywhere. Set up was a breeze. Just be sure you don't need additional Ethernet ports since this only has one extra. I have a home video surveillance system so I needed to purchase an additional Ethernet switch box to accommodate it but was a simple fix. But if you want a system that's super modern, sophisticated and intuitive, this is the only one to consider. A bit pricey? How much did your iPhone cost? It's worth it. You'll be done even thinking about wifi after you install this system. ",
SandyToes,"July 5, 2016 ",5.0,"I started with two, but it turned out I needed three to get from the far end of the main house through the garage and upstairs to my studio. Once I had all three, the speed and reliability were fantastic. So easy to set up and so trouble free. I just put everybody on the guest network so the main network would remain free of viruses and lurkers. There are two teenagers in the house with multitudes of friend who all use wifi for their phones, notebooks, and laptops. They have not affected the speed at all. I'm impressed! Oh, and this was after replacing the modem twice, and utilizing three different routers just to get the house up to speed. Obviously none of them worked as well as I wanted them to.

"T. Campbell","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I replaced my 2 year old Apple Time Capsule with eero.  I improved my signal strength by 70% in the two other locations that I needed to get a solid Wi-Fi signal.  I used the WiFi signal app from the Mac app store to measure the improvement.  I now have a solid signal everywhere in the house.  I was also able to turn off Wi-Fi on the Time Capsule and now just use it as a Time Machine.    eero is super simple to setup.  Just follow along with the app that you need to download to your phone and it walks you through each step.  I had 3 devices installed and connected in less that 15 minutes.  A trick you may want to try if this eero is replacing an existing router. Name the eero network with exactly the name as your old network and use your old password.  That way any device connecting to your network does not need to be reconfigured.  I have 3 Wemo devices, 2 iPads, 2 iPhones, Alexa, Dot, 2 Apple TVs, 1 Wireless Laser printer and two TiVo units and none of them needed any configuration changes.  Saved a lot of time and hassle.    Overall I am really happy with erro! ",
Seewolf,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I spent a lot of time looking at different mesh systems and settled on the eero. I couldn't be happier.    I previously had multiple wifi networks in my home to provide full coverage over the three floors. I spent quite a bit of time looking at systems from Ubiquiti and Luma. I purchased an Ubiquiti system that was open box and one of the three access points was giving me trouble so I ended up returning it. The Luma system I had on order was promised for months and never arrived. Thank you to Amazon for helping me get that straightened out. Luckily for me, the delay gave me a chance to read reviews of bot the eero and Luma system and I decided to pay the extra money for the eero system.    I'm lucky that my home has an extensive wired network in place so I was able to install all three pieces with wired connections - one on each level of the home. I now have fast and strong connections in every room of my home with no dead spots and no need to change from one network to another. The ability to see every device (wired and wireless) in the house is great. My previous main wireless router was the SkyDog system and I got used to having easy access to turn on and off individual devices and assign them to groups. This is great when the kids are spending too much time online and need a gentle reminder that it is time to put the electronics away (although it isn't really that gentle when there access is suddenly shut off!).    I've been very happy with the speed of the wifi. My home currently has 80Mbps broadband. My previous system never came close to this speed but I now routinely see the full 80Mbps through speedtest.net or fast.com (when the wifi traffic on the network is low).    A couple of things I would like to see:  - The ability to hide the SSID. There is currently no way to turn off the transmission of the network name. I usually keep this hidden, in a dense neighborhood I see this as one extra layer of security.  - A filter for web content. This is one thing I loved about the SkyDog system (RIP) and one of the big reasons I initially had a Luma system on order but am so happy with the rest of the system the I'm willing to deal with that. By the way, as of the writing of this review I have a friend who did get the Luma system and has been disappointed so far since (according to them) the filter function is not yet active.    Overall, I would recommend this system to anyone who needs a robust mesh network to cover a larger home or small office. ",
"Reed H","July 14, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought a 3 pack as a Christmas/House warming gift for my son who just moved into a 3 story home and was hoping he already had a good system for their new home and I would be able to keep the eero.  No such luck as he hooked it up in no time and was excited about the speed and that it found his nest thermostat and smoke detectors.  They also have a studio living space above their detached garage that they will rent out and promised all utilities and didn't have a solution for wifi.  This solved that issue.    That night in the guest bedroom on the third floor I tried a speed test and only registered 4.44 download and 1.45 upload. I wasn't impressed until I realized I was on their old wifi.  I switched to the eero network a minute later and registered 119.69 download and 6.20 upload.  He is on Xfinity cable.    So I had to get one for myself for our three story  home  with basement and lathe and plaster walls.  I no longer have to hold my iPad up in the air, pointing to the door if I try to read email in bed!  My download speeds there went from 3.5 to 89.4.  I'm also on cable.    I did have a little trouble setting it up and called their support on New Year's Eve in the morning and they didn't give me a bad time when I figured out that I hadn't screwed the cable into the modem properly as it was merely dangling like chad on a Florida ballot!

I constantly had to reset one or the other device weekly and was getting tired of dropping coverage all the time.  I found eero on Amazon, looked at the reviews and gave it a try. It took me about 10-15 minutes to find a location for and set up all three devices and haven't touched them since. They have updated on their own once and I maybe looked at the app 2-3 times in the last month (out of pure curiosity) and haven't had a single issue yet.

"Brian D. Liddicoat","April 23, 2016 ",5.0,"This solved my wifi range issues. I used a Blackhawk router before and also tried an Amped Wireless Athena... Both are incapable of delivering reliable wifi to my entire house. I have about 22 wifi devices on my network including a few iPads, Android devices and 8 Nest Cams. The Nest cam kept dropping off the grid because of a weak signal. Ever since the Eero, no more issues. I put the eero's at acceptable distances and the wifi signal is solid everywhere I go in my house. The last Nest Cam I installed was on the back of my detached garage, so I was out of range. I added a 4th Eero to my setup and BINGO! Worked like a charm. The wifi signal is seamlessly available anywhere I can move inside my house or even in my yard.

"Hugo Du Bois","July 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I purchased  3 pack several weeks ago to replace an old set of routers I had at my previous house.  I moved to a 2000 square foot ranch house that is spread out more than my old house. The old routers and extenders were not handling everything thoughout the house and yard.  When I moved I purchased a 75MB service.  The best service I could get from the old routers inside the house was 29MB.  After hearing about EERO on the podcast IOS Today I started reading the reviews for the EERO over several weeks I finally decided to purchase the 3 pack.  It was amazing how easy it  was to install the three units.  I did not have any probems getting them up and running. The modem is down in the basement so the first EERO is down there next to the modem.. The next one is on the main level in the middle of the house to the front of the house in the office.  The third one is about 30 feet away from the one in the basement but on the main level on the back side of the house.  Coverage is fantastic inside the house, the garage  and out in the front yard and back yard!  I now receive the 75MB that I am paying for and have great coverage everywhere!

SandS,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"So I live in a relatively small split level and we couldn't get better than 1/3 the bandwidth in any room but the basement where our Verizon router was. So we decided to try Eero.  Excellent decision.    Install was a breeze, though I realized our three locations didn't work perfectly at first. The second Eero I attempted to install in the mid-level wouldn't connect.  Proceeding to the third box, in the top level just above our basement Eero, it connected fine.  Then I attempted the second box again and no problems.    Basically, you have to be prepared to let Eero build your network over again.    But now we have full bandwidth everywhere in our house. We went from 50/50 in the basement and 12ish elsewhere to 58/52 everywhere. Just a couple weeks later and now our only problem is our ISP.    Units are also simple, clean looking and stay out of the way. ",

"Gerald Barber","July 7, 2016 ",5.0,"The Good: The Eero is a great wifi extender. I live in a split ranch house which has 3 levels and is approximately 100 feet from end to end on the main level. It's also almost 60 years old and built with material much more impervious to wifi signals than modern construction. I've tried numerous wifi routers and range extenders in an attempt to provide coverage throughout my house and, until Eero, they all failed miserably with large dead zones in various regions of the house that couldn't be eliminated no matter what I tried. Eero is the first system that I found that is able to provide not only wifi coverage, but a strong signal, throughout every room in my house. Why then am I only giving it 1 star?    The Bad: Unfortunately, both Eero software and documentation are incredibly buggy. Moreover, even when a more recent version of the software is released, the customer cannot initiate or force their devices to update and instead must wait for the update to be pushed out to their units by the Eero rolling system. In fact, I've been unable to get the update to the latest released version of the software even after contacting technical support to report an issue that I was having. This brings me to the the other major reason for my 1 star rating, customer and/or technical support, or more correctly the near absence of this support. In a little over a week, I've contacted Eero 3 times. The first time, I received a boilerplate response from their website that was totally unresponsive to the issue I raised. Not only did the text on the Eero website not contain the appropriate information that I required to install/setup the Eero system on my network but also my reply to Eero indicating that their boilerplate response didn't address the question that I specifically asked was completely ignored with no further answer or information provided. It was only through trial and error that I was able to figure out the steps that I needed to take to setup the Eero system. After completing the initial setup, I needed to open some ports on the Eero for forwarding of specific Internet communication to other devices running on my system. I soon discovered that this also didn't work as described. I again contacted Eero support, only to be told that their system indicated that the ports I was attempting to forward were indeed open. Still I could not get external communication to work. Ultimately, I discovered that, due to a bug in their software, even if your device only requires/uses TCP communication, you have to open both the TCP and UDP protocols on the port before Eero with correctly forward the communication to the appropriate device. I recontacted Eero support and was told that they're &#34;aware of this issue.&#34; Finally, I noticed that, concurrent with replace my router with Eero, my network developed terrible latency issues in communication between local devices. Devices that had near instantaneous response with the old router were now taking 2 to 6 seconds to respond and this delay was causing both software and hardware to fail. I again contacted technical support. It took 2 days to get a response, which was to escalate the issue. It took another 2 days before I heard for the escalation agent and this response just asked for more specifics on my system, which I immediately sent. Now 6 days after I originally reported the problem and 4 days after it was supposedly escalated, I'm still waiting on a response that would actually help me resolve the problem.    In summary, if it happens to work with your network out of the box, Eero is an outstanding wifi system. However, you're on your own if it doesn't. The document is inadequate, the software is buggy, and technical support is virtually non-existent. As a result, I cannot recommend this system for non-IT professionals.    Edit: 02/08/2017 - Eero now allows the user to initiate a manual update instead of waiting for the update to be rolled out to the device. ",
"eero Support","December 4, 2016 ",5.0,"&nbsp;I hate to have to write this review as I really wanted these Eero's to work. However, as it turns out, my old apple airports never had the issues I experienced until I switched over to Eero. Once I switched back to the old airports, all the following issues went away.    Frequent Drops  As seen in the attached video, you'll notice that the throughput goes up and down every 30-45 seconds, which is significant enough that it causes streaming music to pause frequently. Of course streaming video was a non-starter. I spent over a month trying to debug this with Eero support with no luck. Note that this issue happens no matter the distance to the access point.    Connectivity  Most of my devices connect fine. However, I have a couple of devices that seem to have connectivity problems on a regular bases. One of my MacBook Pro's required me to hard code an IP in order to maintain a connection. Same issue was found with an iPad as well. Note that this issue happens no matter the distance to the access point.    Company  It's also important to note that I tried to work with the company to resolve these issues for a couple of months. I started the process with Eero Support within the first month, creating videos and providing long detailed explanations regarding the behaviors. They logged into my devices remotely to monitor the behavior and also sent me a custom firmware.  However, now that it seems like they won't be able to fix the issues, I asked for a refund. However, eero refused because they said it was over a month since I purchased the product. I explained that this hardly seemed fair given I, in good faith, worked with their support organization to resolve their product issues, conversations which started BEFORE the month mark. I would recommend folks thinking about purchasing an eero make sure you quickly confirm the performance of the product and return the product right away if any issues are all are found instead of working with Support given this policy.

"eero support","March 15, 2017 ",1.0,"Perfect solution to cover a large two-story house.  We have heavy users (streaming video, game systems, multiple phones, tablets, laptops, DVRs, etc.) at every corner of the house and the three pack covers everything very nicely.  It did take 24 hours and a firmware update to get to full speed, but it took care of itself.  Running the microwave used to make every wifi device pause, but not anymore!    A setup tip:  The quality of the system is sensitive to the placement of each unit.  If a unit is not getting a good signal, try moving it 6 inches in any direction. One unit had a very poor connection when placed behind a speaker, but moving to the side on the speaker allowed a full strength signal and full speed.    A bonus - the most recent update added the ability for family control.  The kids' devices can be set to Pause each night - no more sneaking videos after bedtime. ",
Anonymous,"December 7, 2016 ",5.0,"This is a game changer in terms of wifi. I know it's expensive and seems excessive but damn it the product just works.    Gone are the days of endless configurations and tweaks to get things right during setup.

You open the box and the equipment is laid out in steps - install this piece first and then the second and so forth. The app is clean and simple and will walk you through the entire process.

"Greg Cooper","December 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I had huge doubts when I began to set these up because the second one I tried to setup was struggling to connect to the first. I did a little reading and they suggest keeping them within line-of-sight of one another. This isn't really possible in my apartment unless I owned maybe 8 or 9 of them and then it would just be an apartment covered in eeros and plugs, not something I want. Fortunately, I was able to position it just outside of line-of-sight and was able to get them to connect. The following morning, however, they had disconnected from one another again which got me insanely worried but they did reconnect without me doing anything other than restarting the first one.    However, since that initial hiccup, it has been unbelievably good. I was previously running a Netgear Nighthawk C7000 and an R7000 (separately across months) and both failed miserably. Neither of these routers are particularly cheap either which made it all the more annoying. My best speed with the R7000, which was the router I was using before switching to eeros, was maxing out at about 190 Mbps in the room where it was located. The speed instantly rocketed up to 290 Mbps which is faster than I'm actually paying for, no one tell Comcast.    I purposefully get a WiFi spot check in various rooms before making the switch so I could get an accurate read out on whether or not the eeros actually improved my network reliability or speed. Here's some of the changes averaged out across 3 tests lasting 10 seconds each (rooms with an eero in them have been marked as such):    Living room (eero): 190 Mbps to 290 Mbps  Kitchen: 110 Mbps to 200 Mbps  Bathroom: 75 Mbps to 145 Mbps  Master bedroom (eero): 15 Mbps to 120 Mbps (the original speed was actually a major reason I looked into eeros)  Second bedroom: 45 Mbps to 150 Mbps    (The remaining eero is located in my hallway, which I never tested before hand)    On top of the speed improvements, it also allowed me to wire in certain devices which have rather poor connections regardless of WiFi speed such as a PS4, Roku, and Apple TV. A major improvement was the reliability of my Philips Hue box. Since I could now put it in a more reasonable location than my living room (which had no bulbs in it), I'm now able to use my Hue bulbs very consistently without bulbs disconnecting from the box.    I've been raving about these to friends and family like crazy and I plan to purchase another three to really create a ridiculous home network with an eero in my second bedroom, kitchen, and maybe at the opposite end of my hallway (I have an T shaped hallway). You should buy! ",
sheilanga,"April 25, 2017 ",4.0,"This is what I was waiting for. Great product and great customer service.  No more problems no matter where I connect to the wifi.  I love the fact that all I need is my only network no more extenders plugged everywhere in the house. Now I'm able to enjoy my ECHO from Amazon.  This is the wifi of the rest of my life.  Soooo happy worth the money I paid ",
"Adam N","July 21, 2016 ",5.0,"Eero is a great mesh system. Unlike the newcomers, they've had a lot of time to matuer the underlying technology -- including inventing some completely new stuff. Their tech support is excellent as well if you do run into issues. ",
Lorac,"April 11, 2016 ",5.0,"The eero has changed everything in our household.  We have a 5,000 square foot home with 3 floors to cover.  The house is long and the cable modem and old router were in the office at the furthest end of the house.  We used high-quality updated routers with after-market antennas yet we still could not keep a decent enough signal at the opposite end of the main floor to run a webcam in the dining room (furthest point from router in office).  In addition we couldn't get adequate signal upstairs or in the basement.  With 10 ft. ceilings it made the distance to upstairs even further.  In the basement only one room directly under the router could get a decent signal.  eero has changed everything for us with respect to multiple dead zones and signal strength.  We used a 3-pack of EERO on the main floor only.  One where the old router was located at one end of the house, another in near the middle of the main floor and the third at the other end (dining room) of the main floor.  The signal strength is so good now we can use any wireless device, including phones, cameras, Hue lights and computers consistently on the main floor.  But.... what we didn't necessarily expect is that with these 3 units spread across the main floor the signal strength is good enough to cover the entire second floor as well as the entire basement.  I checked all areas using the WiFi Analyzer app on my android phone.  We even have signal strength in the garage to install a wifi security camera there as well.  Now we can use an iPad in the basement living room.  We can use any device in the bedrooms upstairs.  This product is extremely easy to set-up.  All you do is plug the first one in and do what your phone app tells you to do to set up the other two units.  It helps you place them appropriately.  We aren't using all features yet, but we plan to give priority to our OOMA voip telephone (also connected via wifi) so voice traffic gets priority over other traffic.  The units look nice on top of furniture or a desk.  I highly recommend an eero 3-pack for large homes! ",
doc,"April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"The eero system is fantastic. The mesh network helping break the chains of multiple SSIDs is a dream come true. Performance is top tier. I have tested this sytem by streaming Netflix 4k, Facebooking on an ipad, and streaming Youtube on two iphones all simultaneously on a 100mbps downstream internet connection and there wasnt a single hiccup or rebuffering. My only issues are that there a some compatibility issues with some of my wifi devices such as my Xbox 360SE and Ring Pro doorbell. It also has compatibility issues with one the most popular Arris owner owned cable modems. The eero app could use a few more features and the system could use a few more advance user features/tools. Otherwise i am mostly happy with it. Highly recommended ",
SlyMosquito,"July 18, 2016 ",5.0,"We've been dealing with spotty internet for years, and we often stream movies and TV shows in our basement on our smart TV, as well as on our computer. Since our router is upstairs, it would often disconnect and not want to even load Netflix, or any other site for that matter. Once I heard about Eero, I knew we had to try it, and boy was it a good choice. We haven't even had it a week, and I can already tell a big difference in connectivity. There hasn't been a single connectivity issue, and it was almost a daily occurrence before. The app is very easy to use to install and edit stuff otherwise, especially for people who don't know a whole lot in this field. I have recommended it to other people, and I would definitely recommend it to all of you who read this. It is definitely worth the money. ",
Tavo,"October 5, 2016 ",4.0,"First I'm in the IT business.  And as a Tech savy person I can say that eero does not come with many configuration options.  That's why I used to have a bunch other routers that support many other options.  But did I need them at home?  Turn out that I don't.  And supporting all of them was a day to day.  Ending on mutiple trips back home or calls from my sons and wife to get back online.  And explain then what to do was not simple.  The old turn off and back on became not just a funny request.    So, I got eero, and it took me 5 minutes to install it.  I was able to use my CAT5E backbone that I already had at home.  Results?  100% WIFI coverage and I have a concrete home with lots of steel and concrete walls.  eero was able to provide full coverage in all floors.  Even the basement.    Now I know who's at home, who is using it.  Whats speed I'm getting directly from the cable modem router, carrier test was only valid directly from the modem. I can do that remotely now and still have a test directly from the modem.  I can pause my kids internet access.    I am extremely happy that I gave up a bunch of things that I could use from traditional routers that I don't need and get an eero to work for me, so I can concentrate in what really matters. ",

Setting up the system took about 15 minutes, and I have had exceptional wireless coverage and speed ever since. No more rebooting, no dead spots. Not a cheap product, but one well worth the cost.

"R. Brunke","March 18, 2017 ",5.0,"I have used EVERY wifi system imaginable. Nothing has ever worked as well as Eero in my house. Even when I bought extra routers to increase the coverage signals were spotty and variable, no matter where I positioned them. With Eero I bought three units and have never looked back!  How good are they? My family runs three DVRs, and a wifi- capable TV, three laptops and various tablets in my house. Even with all of that the speed is consistently high in all my locations.  They were the easiest to install networks as well. The app made the installation basically plug and play.  Visually they are unobtrusive and elegant.  No boxes looking contraptions with antennae sticking out.  People don't notice them although one of them sits on a low book shelf in my family room.  About the only complaint I have is that they are Expensive. But having bought expensive and cheap systems before I deem Eero worth every penny I paid for it. My wife consults from home so having reliable hi-speed wifi helps maintain 'domestic tranquility.' ",
goldengate98,"April 19, 2016 ",5.0,"I currently have a Sonic-wall Firewall which manages my entire homeâ€™s network, including the Sonic-wall wireless access points. Sonic-wall is connected to our Comcast modem which is in bridge mode. I have always struggled to get access points working on a consistent basis. They frequently drop out or slow down to the point of extreme frustration. I have a central control system with music, lighting, CCTV, and a security system with APPS that are controlled by personal i Pads and i Phones. So it is crucial for me to have a reliable Wi-Fi connection at home. I am not a techie and had to rely heavily on network guys to configure and set up my system. Over the years my family has given me an earful on the quality of Wi-Fi in the house. I spent $$$$ on the hardware and networking experts.  I came across eero Home Wi-Fi System while looking for a better alternative. I was very skeptical about eero when I first watched the video. I thought they were trying to sell me snake oil!  I called the customer service multiple times to make sure that the product was real and would work as promised. I finally felt confident enough and opted to buy a 3-pack on Amazon. It arrived on time. The packaging was reminiscent of Apple products. The units looked cool and chic! I hooked up the first unit to the Comcast modem (which is in bridge mode for the Sonic-wall Firewall unit), and I plugged the rest into regular electrical outlets. The first unit was configured and worked like magic. The other units were easy to configure also, but I noticed that the signal strength was low. After a few phone calls to customer service agents, I was able to replace some of the Sonic-wall access points with eero units. I converted all of the units to bridge mode. Voila! The units worked perfectly. I bought another 4 units and replaced all the Sonic-wall access points with eero units. They formed excellent mesh and the signal was rock solid. The download and upload speed matched what I signed up for with Comcast, almost 3-4 times compared to my previous set up. Now I am able to use the APPS with great reliability anywhere in the house. My family thinks I am an expert tech guy now (I want to keep it that way).  I wish I had these units many years ago. This is definitely a disruptive product in terms of configuration and reliable mesh formation. It eliminates the complex process of configuration and the need for a technical expert.  I have had this set up for 4 weeks now. So far I am very pleased with the performance. I have not experienced any drops so far. It also gives the ability to have guest access, which is a cool feature.  I think eero works best when connected to Ethernet. I did not try it without Ethernet since I have a pre-wired network already in place, but I am sure the units will do just fine even without an Ethernet hook up. ",
"Suresh Reddy","March 15, 2017 ",5.0,"Easy set up, works great.  Even bought a set for my in-laws who were having signal issues 25 feet from their Fios router.  They have a split level home with the Fios modem/router in the basement near the stairs.  I put one Eero there and one on the main level at the back of the house.  They now have a good signal all over the inside of the house and out back on the deck as well.  I live in a 3 level colonial and get a great signal with just two Eeros - one on the main level at the right side of the house attached to the Fios modem/router and one in my closet (not even out in the open) in the top floor left side of the house.  I still get a decent signal about 150 feet in front of my house outside.  Such a great product for its ease of set up (10 minutes) and ability to easily name and choose a password for your network.  No more staying with the default network name and password that comes on the Verizon router because who the hell wants to take the time how to figure out how to connect to it to change it?  While I (35 year old guy) set up mine and my in-laws, I am confident that even my mom could figure this out and she still needs tutorial every time she wants to transfer photos from her camera to her PC.  One thing I noticed: they do get warm so keep it in the open air by itself and on a ventilated shelf if you can.  Enjoy! ",
"Meghan K Test","April 21, 2016 ",5.0,"A really excellent product.  I bought an eero to attempt to replace my Netgear Nighthawk 7000 and 2 Netgear range extenders in my ca. 4000 sq. ft. 2 story house.  The Nighthawk worked well, but there were still areas in the house that had marginal wi-fi, and the existence of 3 networks was a continuing challenge to less tech-savvy users in the household :)    The eero system (3 pack) was a breeze to set up and immediately gave full and complete coverage (with a single SSID) all over the house.  I did have some throughput issues; the throughput was lower in some areas than the Nighthawk (but always higher than the extenders), but I finally solved that by repositioning on of the eeros boxes.  Now I get great performance connecting to my ~180Mbps Comcast connection and near 100% signal strength everywhere in the house.  eero tech support was quite helpful in solving these issues (though the turnaround time from them was a bit slow).    The only improvements I would make at this point (2 weeks after purchase) would be some more tools to help in optimizing performance (signal strength meters viewable in the apps, better network mapping representations) and also the ability to stealth all ports.  I have been seeing more portscans and network attacks than with the Nighthawk, as the Nighthawk stealths all ports, and the eero only stealths a few.    Highly recommend this system.    Update after several months:  This product is fantastic.  Literally set it and forget it connectivity.  I have had NO issues with eero, just solid, fast wifi all over my house.  An excellent product that lives up to its marketing slogans.    Update 2: I decided to buy another single eero direct from eero.  FedEx lost the package and was a complete and utter pain to deal with.  After about 7 days, I contacted eero and told them what had happened.  Eero support was absolutely wonderful, took my info and said they'd get back to me.  4 hours later, I got a notice that my replacement eero had been shipped.  Even though the original order had 5 day shipping, they shipped the replacement overnight.  This time, FedEx actually delivered it!  10 minutes after receiving it, the new eero was up and running.  Great support is critical in a company like this, and eero delivered an A+ experience. ",
longtimeAmazonian,"September 21, 2016 ",5.0,"Using a 3 pack for a 4500sq.ft.+ 3 level house on a slope. Provides great coverage and was pretty easy to set up. I love the fact that it works well with handing off the network connection between units. No more manually migrating between SSIDs or funny tricks to get a good connection.    Great product!! Will be interested to see if they bring out bigger versions for even better coverage and higher speed. The concept is great, and these work really well with a little thought during installation.    Do note that there a few things to keep in mind.    1. Don't expect blazing speeds you may see with the latest WiFi routers. We have about 100Mb/s downlink speed from the cable provider. I have setup the eeros to be daisy chained, so on the lower level it has 2 hops. I can still get 100Mb/s over 2 hops on the lower level, but it does drop to 30-40 on the further rooms. In some cases it will drop to 20 on the far corners (still beats less than 5 or none with the WIfi extenders).    2. Take your time to find the right spots for these units. I found it best to find offset locations on each level with the units about 35ft in a direct line with as few walls and obstructions between them. This meant that some corners in the house were further away from a unit. This seems to work much better than trying to find a middle ground between the dead zone and the other eero. For me it worked best to get the eeros closer to each other on each level and then devices are further away on the extreme rooms.    3. Give it time to adapt. It seems to work best to put in the first eero, then find a good spot for the 2nd one and test the speed. Leave alone for a while ( few hours) and then find a good spot for the 3rd unit. In our case we set it up that the 3rd eero would connect to the 2nd to get the most coverage. It was still a little flaky on the most extreme corners and speed and coverage was so-so. Left it overnight and it worked very well after that.    Update: August 2016  Had some issues with one unit and had to return it. Process was very easy dealing with Eero.  Also found that the remote units started to drop out consistently, which was very frustrating. After lots of troubleshooting I redid my modem coax connection to the cable provider, the speed stayed the same, but suddenly the eero wifi network was reliable again and all units stayed up. Additional bonus was that my connection speed on far away corner went from 20 to 40 Mb/s. I suspect there was dropped packets form modem to cable provider that messed with eero, but with limited tools hard to pin down. ",

"Omar Shahine","April 24, 2016 ",4.0,"On paper, these two companies are similar. They are startups that are well funded, and have recently launched devices that are about the size of an Apple TV or an Apple Airport Express. You typically buy a pack of 3, plugging one into your modem and the others to ethernet or leave alone and they will create a wireless mesh network. eero has been the market longer than luma.  If you have Sonos, then you are already familiar with mesh networks. Like Sonos, these devices can talk to each other via wireless, as long as each one can &#34;see&#34; the other. From there they re-distribute the wifi signal creating a constant amount of coverage.    These devices are also incredibly easy to setup and manage (in theory). You do everything from your phone app. And you can manage your network from anywhere. They are cloud powered routers. eero has written a lot about their cloud operations. Impressive.    However, that is where the comparisons end. I have used both devices now and can weigh in on which one is better.Â     I got an eero for my father and set that up in May. I also got a Luma for myself, and waited a few months longer to get that. Then I also got an eero for myself after some disappointing results with the luma.    Below is my experience with both.    Unboxing  The clear winner here is eero. The simple explanation is that the eero is like unboxing an Apple Product. The box is easy to open, the materials are top notch (glossy white plastic and soft touch rubber). The charger and finishes are exactly what you would get from an Apple Product.    The Luma on the other hand feels cheap. The power plug is gray, but exactly like any other electronic product. The device box is cheap plastic feeling.Â   For many people this device will be visible in their home (like it is for my parents) and so I think this matters.    Oh, almost forgot. It was comical hard to actually open the luma box. No product should be hard to get out.    Winner: eero    Setup  To set up each device, you install their iOS app, then plug in the first device and go through the setup process.    The eero device completed setup in under 10 seconds. It was what I expected, so I didn't think much of it.    The luma device took a very long time to setup and failed multiple times. This repeated with each device I set up. It was a bit baffling to be honest.  Once the devices are set up, you are now ready to add more devices.    Winner: eero    Software updates  Both devices manage software updates automatically. With the eero you can see what version you have. The software updates automatically overnight, and in the latest app update they added a mode where you can force an update. You can even see release notes here.    The luma does not show you any information about what version of the software it's running and there is no way to update, or see release notes or anything.    It's worth noting, that when I was setting up my father's eero devices, the software updates never came down. I called eero and talked to a live person and he was pretty amazing at getting it resolved. It took a few calls and emails and they determined that one of the devices was faulty and they overnight shipped a replacement the next day. I didn't have a chance to work with luma on anything like that, but the experience with eero was very impressive.    Winner: eero    Phone App  As I mentioned you do everything from the phone app. In the case of the eero I can manage my network and my Dad's from the same app. When I next visit my sister, I plan to get her setup with eero as well and I'm guessing she will need at least 5 devices.    In each phone app you can do things like manage your wifi setup and password, choose a guest network (and share the network name and password), see all the connected devices and also create profiles for each person in the house and do some basic parental controls.  Right now, I think the luma app has the edge because it has a visual map of your wifi coverage which I find handy.Â     Winner: luma    Parental Controls  Both apps offer basic parental controls. The reason I wanted to get the luma was that they had said they would offer very deep parental controls. In that time eero added parental controls and luma still hasn't delivered on what they said they would offer.    Here is the deal. They are both limited at this right now. The best parental control device (and generally useful network management device) is the Circle with Disney. I will review this soon, but I can tell you right now that it's 5 star.    Circle, the most advanced parental control device    Winner: tie    Reliability and Performance  These are highly complex devices making your life simple and easy. The first few months for eero were bumpy and that's also true for luma. Amazon Reviewers rate the eero far higher than luma (4.4 star for eero vs 2.9 stars for luma). There are some very troubling issues with luma that will be resolved with time. For one thing, the Amazon rating trajectory for them is rather bad. They will need to fix this.    The biggest issue I immediately ran into with luma was that every few hours, my iPhone, PC, iPad would spin for a few seconds before completing a task such as loading a web page.    I though maybe that was just me.... but no, my wife and kids noticed it to. I did some light trouble shooting turning parental controls off and so on (this is before we had the Circle).Â     I also did a lot of speed tests. I have 120 Mbps service from Comcast and with the Luma not once did I ever see sustained performance hard wired. The eero however has constantly been clocking in at my full bandwidth.  In the end, my tolerance for this stuff is super low. Internet needs to work always and work well. I returned the luma after 2 days and my life with the eero has been glorious.    Winner: eero    Cost  The luma is cheaper. This is by design as eero was the first to market and has a lot of mindshare. To get people to pay attention, I believe luma undercut them (the 3 pack is $100 cheaper from luma).  However, this is an important investment for your house. I would not recommend getting the luma due to its lower cost. That $100 could be a big deal in the long run.    When purchasing I'd recommend getting the 3 pack as each device is priced at $166 vs $199 individuals. There is also a 2 pack. I got one 3 and one 2 pack.    Winner: luma    Final Thoughts  It's really exciting to Â me that wifi is entering a new era. Surround wifi will solve dead spot and coverage issues for so many families.    I fully expect the luma to resolve a number of the problems I identified. However, at this time the eero has been in the market longer, and is the clear leader.    I am super happy with my setup. I now have 5 eero devices in my house, they are all hard wired except for the one. I have replaced everything else powering wifi in the house and it's glorious.Â     I highly recommend getting eeros.    Winner: eero ",
"Jim Hood","March 28, 2017 ",5.0,"Trying to get a signal into all corners of our three-level house was never easy. I had to use two routers but even then there were dead spots, not to mention the necessity of running cable to the second router. I never found a wireless booster that would work as advertised and always had to revert to cabling the second router. eero changed all that. I unpacked the three eero routers and within 15 minutes, they were working perfectly without any need to fiddle with complex settings.    The app that accompanies the routers is very useful. Among other things, it lets you see each device that is on the network, its name, IP address, etc. This makes it much easier to get wireless printers, etc., working and troubleshoot them when they get cranky.

"Hunter Brumfield","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"Works very well in our 2-story condo. It occasionally loses one of the three units but recovers easily. We've banished the previous frustrations we had and gained great Netflix streaming with zero buffering. A very superior product! ",
"Ed Wilkinson","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Thanks to eero's Home WiFI System my transition to Smart Home technologies is now HIGHLY responsive.  Starting with my AMAZON Echo, I began adding WeMo devices throughout my two story home.  All worked fine, albeit occasionally with a slight &#34;lag&#34;.  Then after installing a Nexia WiFi Thermostat with my new Heat-pump, connectivity became more of a challenge.  So, I got the Three Pack.  And, WOW!!  All of my WiFi devices reported FOUR (or if the device showed 5) BAR full connectivity.  Responsive - I merely mention to Alexa that I want to turn something on or off; or to raise or lower thermostat temperature and it's accomplished in an instant; when connecting to my WiFi notebook out on the back deck my download speed &#34;pegs the meter&#34;.  WOW!    Now to set up:  It's so easy it is almost embarrassing.  It took all of 5 minutes to connect the entire 3 Pack System providing total home coverage just by following the directions on the erro app.  As a Boomer I frequently rely on my 13 Year Old Nephew for &#34;Tech Support&#34;.  Not this time!  The erro is clearly &#34;Boomer-Friendly&#34;. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 25, 2016 ",4.0,"We have had the eero 3-unit system for a few months and it has been amazing. Extremely easy to install and setup. We live in a 100 year-old 4-story brick house and the Wifi + extender was just not getting the job done.  I probably could add one more extender as the base is on the top floor, but it is working brilliantly. The signal strength stays very consistent and we have had minimal interruptions since installation.    I will say that once there is an interruption with one of the units, you have to remove it from the network and then add it back in - at least that is the only way I could reset the unit. We have regularly 12-14 different devices connected with a maximum DSL speed of 11-12mbps. Highly recommend the eero system. ",
"Edward H.","August 12, 2016 ",5.0,"I have a 4,400 sq ft home with the cable modem stuck in the basement.  A really tough design for coverage.  I replaced an Apple system which was good but not delivering AC 5g throughout.  What a difference.  Speedtest consistently shows 70-130 Mbps throughout the house.  My surface operates at 650-850 where in the same spot it was 144.  (I think due to lack of AC 5g strength).  This system seems to get even better over time as it figures out your house.    You won't be disappointed. ",
"Gonzalo Alberto Gomez A","April 30, 2016 ",5.0,"Beyond simplicity, finally, something that really work an Erro solved in the most simple (Not cheap but no expensive).  I'm so glad to have been bought eero devices and it was not just for me, my wife loved it; she is not technical and not having to switch between 6 different networks around my house is fantastic for her and I don't have to provide technical support for everyone anymore and I don't have to explain why I have so many WIFI networks :).

sporley,"May 28, 2016 ",5.0,"After constantly having to reset wifi router, turn off, wait turn back on check do it again or repeat every few days I saw the eero advertised. I read some comments and decided to try it. The Initial problem was having to have a US number. Living in the Middle East this was a slight frustration but emailed eero help and got some tips on what to do. Since installing in Feb-17 I haven't had to reset once! I have added some more eero for upstairs in my house and again its amazing product.  Thoroughly recommend to anyone who currently has wifi problems! ",
Cathy,"December 23, 2016 ",5.0,"Having worked with various networking equipment for over 20 years, Eero has made the tech savy requirement obsolete. Very simple, clear and quick setup instructions made configuring 3 hubs extremely boring - which is a great thing!! About as close to 'plug and play' as you can get. My hubs are over the recommended 40 feet apart, going thru floors and walls, including a fire rated garage wall, and all have excellent signal strength.I balked a little at the price, but the little extra was well worth the performance and stability of the equipment. The hardest part of the entire installation was figuring out a name for the network. :-) ",
Abhi,"March 28, 2017 ",5.0,"Works really well - I'm getting much faster streaming between network devices (I currently have Tivo Minis in other rooms that stream off a regular Tivo Premiere over wifi) - I do have FIOS so I just plugged the first eero as a router into the FIOS modem-router (and shut off all wifi antennae from the FIOS router) so all my devices now work on the eero-based network.The other thing that the eero wifi system has solved is random disconnects by devices. All my devices have stable connections - the eero app makes administration super simple. As a point of reference, I used to have the 3 router setup before where I'd manually configured them and it was a pain and very unreliable. So I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to replace a multi-router setup with something seamless like we see in modern office buildings. ",
ChrisGeek,"December 31, 2016 ",5.0,"So far so great! I updated my home network from two Apple Airport Extremes in bridge mode to three eeros, and I can easily say my network and wifi has never been more reliable.

"Teri A. Moseley","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"We live in a 3-level, 4K+ sqft house.  The 3-pack has eliminated all dead spots.  The interface allows me to see who is using my system and then block them if I so choose.  We run mostly Apple devices and an Xbox seamlessly.  I installed this last October and have seen it improve over that time from initial download speeds in the 30-40s to what we have now.  Our download speeds after the last update are consistently over 100Mbps.  The system does seem to &#34;learn&#34; your house. ",
"John I. Fishburne","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I purchased my eero after a write up in the Wall Street Journal.  I have been very pleased with my purchase, as my download speed has increased by a factor of 6, as measured at the far end of my house.  I now have no use for the power adapter system that I had used before, with many buffering interruptions.  Now I have no buffering interruptions.    Since I wrote the above review I have added an extension to my house at the opposite end to where the Comcast cable enters the house.  My original placement of the eeros was line of sight use of the three to have a strong signal for streaming video in my family room.  When I added the extension to my house I added another cable entry point in the extension and purchased a modem and Netgear router.  I found that the router speed was far less than I was accustomed to with the eeros in the rest of the house.  So I took the middle of the house eero, reset it for the new modem and installed it in the new extension.  I found that my internet speed was three times faster in the new extension (85mps), while I suffered no loss of signal speed in the family room, despite having removed the center house eero.  My old system involved the use of an Airport Extreme router with three extenders.  It often quit for no apparent reason, requiring rebooting of the router and all extenders.  I have not had to reboot any of the eeros since they were installed.  I have a strong signal throughout my house and the only time I experience buffering is when my cable is at fault.  Needless to say I am very pleased with the eero network. ",
"Kindle Customer","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I work in IT and live in a 2500 sqft 2 story home.  I have always had trouble with wireless.  I've tried everything.  Repeaters, routers converted into gateways, different routers, seriously, all kinds of tests, configurations, products and... this solved my problem.  Now I have fast wireless in the house and outside.  I used to do test in my office as an acid test and I always got an unstable 5Mbps or less.  Now I get 85 to 100 Mbps in the same location.  The same location I have used for testing for years.  Never has anything ever come close.  And I can now go all over the house and I get really nice, fast connections.  This is a great product. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 28, 2016 ",5.0,"This system works exactly the way they described, and does exactly what I wanted. I have one unit plugged into the feed from my cable modem at one end of the house, with the second unit at the other end of the house. The second is only plugged into power and relays over the wireless - I get plenty of speed to stream HD video / audio / voice calls to my devices at that far end of the house, no problems or hiccups. The third unit is in my shop, beyond the far end of the house. There's definitely a little bit of speed loss out there, but it works just fine to stream howto videos on youtube or music. It's way less effort than trying to run cat6 everywhere, and better throughput than powerline, especially going out to the shop.    I do run in bridge mode, so I'm not using Eero to do do routing/firewall - I really got it to do mesh wifi, and it does that brilliantly. The automatic firmware updates happen overnight during low/no usage periods, quickly, and I've never actually noticed it happening. ",
hdtravel,"November 21, 2016 ",5.0,"I purchased the 3 pack. Extremely easy to setup. Very beautiful packaging and modern elegant design to the units. Covers my entire ranch style house and yard.

"Florida Bill","August 3, 2016 ",5.0,"I e gone through different levels of wifi systems only to still have dead spots around the house. The eero system is beyond amazing! Not a single dead spot including backyard pool area or sitting in front porch. The signal is super strong everywhere. Set up was a breeze. Just be sure you don't need additional Ethernet ports since this only has one extra. I have a home video surveillance system so I needed to purchase an additional Ethernet switch box to accommodate it but was a simple fix. But if you want a system that's super modern, sophisticated and intuitive, this is the only one to consider. A bit pricey? How much did your iPhone cost? It's worth it. You'll be done even thinking about wifi after you install this system. ",

All done through a simple smartphone app.  I was able to stream, wireless print, email, from all the previous dead zones on a Saturday afternoon which is a busy tiime for internet use across our home and the neighboring competing networks.  All at much faster speeds than using the modem with Apple booster.  Out of the box we are thrilled!  We will see how it stays up and running over time, but off to an outstanding start! ",
SandyToes,"May 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I started with two, but it turned out I needed three to get from the far end of the main house through the garage and upstairs to my studio. Once I had all three, the speed and reliability were fantastic. So easy to set up and so trouble free. I just put everybody on the guest network so the main network would remain free of viruses and lurkers. There are two teenagers in the house with multitudes of friend who all use wifi for their phones, notebooks, and laptops. They have not affected the speed at all. I'm impressed! Oh, and this was after replacing the modem twice, and utilizing three different routers just to get the house up to speed. Obviously none of them worked as well as I wanted them to. I'm very happy with my Eeros. ",
"P. Gordon","June 18, 2016 ",5.0,"I decided to purchase this system after reading the great reviews and needing a way to get decent wifi out to my back porch and garage. I liked my trusty old Apple AirPort base station but even using an additional Airport Express as an extender wasn't performing well. My devices often wouldn't switch over to the closer device, and speeds were pretty poor. I eventually quit using the Express and tossed it into my spare gadget box. I set the eero system up in just a few minutes, and everything just works, perfect, everywhere in the house and most of my yard. Far better than my best effort before. It's not cheap but unless you actually enjoy configuring wifi networks it's well worth the price. ",
"Robert Ricketts","July 23, 2016 ",5.0,"EERO is simple to install (requires a smartphone, either iOS or Android) and works great. This is closest system to approximating distributed wired APs performance-wise that I have found. Unlike mesh systems that use store and forward, there is no hop speed reduction or added latency. It just works! This is my go-to solution now for setting up whole-home wifi systems for clients that want to use their gadgets all over their (usually larger) homes. There's very little in the way of customization that IT geeks like myself might appreciate, but for the vast majority of folks that just want reliable wi-fi, this is the answer. ",
"Roger E. Ison","July 7, 2016 ",5.0,"My 3 eeros replaced a custom setup using DD-WRT flashed into a Buffalo router and a bridged Apple router in a large house.  Eero was easiest setup ever. The first day it was somewhat slow, as measured by a couple of test apps running in an iPad Pro. But eeros updated their firmware overnight and the system became progressively faster. Since 3rd day, by far the fastest and most complete coverage I've ever had in the house. So far we've experienced no problems, even with as many as 15 devices connected and 3 streaming simultaneously. Both my iPad Pro and wired PCs regularly report 80 - 90 megabit/sec downloads over a Comcast cable in a somewhat rural location. It's actually a little hard to believe. We have had one extended power failure, and the eero network brought itself back online normally when power was restored.    Eeros do not yet support IPv6, although it is promised as &#34;coming soon&#34;. I'd like to add one more eero to improve coverage in one corner of the lower level of the house (although the existing setup does reach there). However, the per-unit cost of a single additional eero is much higher than the per-unit cost of my set of three.  The manufacturer should offer a better add-on price for existing customers. ",
Jim,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I had spent hours on the phone with AT&T, NetFlix and Vizio as I repeatedly had viewing issues. Further we had dead spots for WiFi and our home is about 2100 sq ft. I tried Netgear and nothing improved the situation. My son told me to check out EERO. This company, their products are game changing. It is easy to install, app works brilliantly, no more dead spots, no TV issues. We have a guesthouse and were told by AT&T we needed to add service and they said no way to  get WiFi; with eero we have super WiFi. I know this is a pricey product but it works. Their support is awesome (though I only called with questions before I purchased - haven't needed any support post purchase). The 'pods' only need and electric outlet (they come with a nice length cord). The app lets you know if they are properly placed for best results. EERO is a GREAT product! (and a great company)    30-DAY UPDATE - eero still works like a champion. It has solved our dead spot or slow speed areas (only issue remains is AT&T Gigapower still goes out for a couple minutes at a time several times a week and if you are live streaming it is a pain BUT eero gives the TV very high download speed). The eero team and product are 5-STAR! ",
"John - Music City USA","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I have two houses, each with unique challenges.  House 1: L shaped, with a mylar wrap on the exterior walls. The may as well be a Faraday cage. I have struggled to get a solid, seamless WiFi network throughout the house, using multiple WAP's. When I saw the Eero, i jumped on it, not realizing that i bought the first week of public release (and started with firmware 1.0.0). I had to get them in bridge mode, as i already had a dual WAN router providing redundant ISP access and Cat 5 cable run throughout the house. The first week or so was a bumpy ride, but support was amazing, especially for a brand new device. (One of the units was defective, replacement arrived in 2 business days.) Now I have seamless WiFi throughout 6,000 square feet on three levels.  House 2: Basic rectangle with full basement, but no existing network wiring and the cable modem all the way at one end. Even worse, no way to run cable until i am willing to tear out the basement ceiling. After my experience with House #1, i figured lets give it a try. This system has the cable modem in bridge mode and the Eero as the router. Over a short period, the (Android) app has bloomed into a full featured configuration tool. Simple for a novice, but jump to the advanced sections and find a pretty robust set of management tools not found in many residential routers. I have a TV hardwired to the Eero furthest from the master and have streamed movies all day without issue. What more can you ask for? ",
D,"September 7, 2016 ",5.0,"Going to have to buy another one or two as the three did not cover my home.

My modem/router is in the garage (Good old Verizon FIOS installers) with 2-3 walls to get into the house and also have an upstairs with both a ceiling and a floor to get the signal through. Can't shoot it up the stairs as stairs have a landing and a 180 degree bend. Solved the upstairs problem by hooking the first one upstairs directly to the modem in the garage via a previously self installed Ethernet cable. Still thinking about the downstairs problem.  If anyone has any suggestions would appreciate them. ",

A friend told me about Eero and I started looking into it.  Based on all of the positive reviews and the company's commitment to continuous improvement of their product with regular firmware updates and tech support, I decided to pull the trigger.  I installed 4 units in our home and we are now awash in super-fast WiFi throughout the furthest reaches of our house and into the front and backyard.

"Christopher Jones","March 28, 2017 ",5.0,"I am a software developer that works 50% of the time from Bogot&aacute;, Colombia. They don't use wood or sheetrock in Colombian construction so my 3 bedroom apartment has solid brick and plaster walls. Because of this, Wifi has always been flaky in our apartment.  Symptoms of the flakiness included poor streaming from Netflix and iTunes over an Apple TV, dropped AirPlay connections to a Bose speaker, and flaky Skype performance. Since I work remotely as a software developer (*very* remotely), reliable networking is essential to my livelihood.    Although the IOS app was straightforward to use, the eero node was initially unable to connect to the internet through the Cable Modem/Router provided by our Colombian ISP, Claro. After working with Eero customer service, they suggested we call our ISP to have the modem put into &quot;bridge&quot; mode. One call by my husband (my spanish isn't good enough) to Claro did the trick to put the cable modem into bridge mode. After that, setup was quick and easy.    Now that we have it working, my network is much more reliable. Streaming now almost never has a delay. The airplay speaker now works reliably. My Skype connections back to my home office are much more solid. It's been a remarkable improvement.

Honestly, we don't really think about our wifi any longer - except for when I happen to see the cute little white square, which, by the way is another plus.  Our last wireless adaptor had so many antennas and continuously blinking lights, our living room was starting to look like the Nassau space center!

milodaman,"April 1, 2017 ",5.0,"&nbsp;I hate to have to write this review as I really wanted these Eero's to work. However, as it turns out, my old apple airports never had the issues I experienced until I switched over to Eero. Once I switched back to the old airports, all the following issues went away.    Frequent Drops  As seen in the attached video, you'll notice that the throughput goes up and down every 30-45 seconds, which is significant enough that it causes streaming music to pause frequently. Of course streaming video was a non-starter. I spent over a month trying to debug this with Eero support with no luck. Note that this issue happens no matter the distance to the access point.    Connectivity  Most of my devices connect fine. However, I have a couple of devices that seem to have connectivity problems on a regular bases. One of my MacBook Pro's required me to hard code an IP in order to maintain a connection. Same issue was found with an iPad as well. Note that this issue happens no matter the distance to the access point.    Company  It's also important to note that I tried to work with the company to resolve these issues for a couple of months. I started the process with Eero Support within the first month, creating videos and providing long detailed explanations regarding the behaviors. They logged into my devices remotely to monitor the behavior and also sent me a custom firmware.  However, now that it seems like they won't be able to fix the issues, I asked for a refund. However, eero refused because they said it was over a month since I purchased the product. I explained that this hardly seemed fair given I, in good faith, worked with their support organization to resolve their product issues, conversations which started BEFORE the month mark. I would recommend folks thinking about purchasing an eero make sure you quickly confirm the performance of the product and return the product right away if any issues are all are found instead of working with Support given this policy.

allgrace,"March 15, 2017 ",1.0,"I was hoping to significantly upgrade my wi-fi experience, and it hasn't quite happened. I used to have a traditional wireless router and a repeater, and I replaced those with 4 eeros strategically placed throughout my home following the optimal location selections per eero's instructions. The end result is I still have spotty and inconsistent coverage in the same parts of the house that I used to. From a pure end user perspective, I would say that the user experience improvement has been marginal at best. It's certainly not worse, but not sure if I gained anything from spending quite a bit on the eeros. I had hoped eero was the answer, but it's not quite. ",

"eero Support","September 23, 2016 ",2.0,"Delivers seamless and continuous wifi coverage throughout the whole house.  Previously, we had been using multiple wireless routers which each created a separate SSID/Network which apps and connected devices couldn't communicate with each other if they were on different SSID's.  This caused many problems and hassles, let alone managing and resetting various routers.  Especially when I started adding smart home devices this became a bigger issue.    Setup was simple and quick.  I like that they are constantly improving the device and apps, and I can create profiles for different family members and associate their devices to their profile, then create schedules for when their wifi on their device will or will not work, or if someone looses wifi privileges, i can disable them not the rest of the house.    Best of all, their support is phenomenal!!  Quick, detailed responses, and they follow up to make sure the issue are resolved.  I plan to get one for my parent house, which will make their setup simpler, and I will have the ability to remotely login without having to drive to their house. ",

"R. McCabe","August 3, 2016 ",5.0,"I live in an old ranch home, and in order to get High-Speed DSL - the router had to be placed at the complete back of our house in the master bedroom.  Nightmare scenario for getting wifi to our living room (where our DVR sits) as well as to our study.  We were using all sorts of WIFI extenders, even creating a second network using our electrical outlets to get wifi to the front of our house.  Unless you were using wifi in our bedrooom the signal was always dropping - we couldn't use on-demand options through our Satellite provider because our dvr kept losing the signal.    I had been looking at eero for a while, but the price seemed prohibitive.  Finally, after yet another night of using airplay to broadcast a buffered signal we were streaming online to our TV to watch a show ( which we should easily be able to download in HD to our DVR), I gave in.  I ordered eero, it arrived under 48 hour hours and in less than 10 minutes I was downloading entire seasons to my dvr.  I am getting more than double the speeds out of our wifi, and our entire home has wifi on the same network.    Could not be happier. ",

LMFNU,"April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"If you have wireless devices they may not stay connected to the system.  Notably printers.  While Eero customer service is helpful and responsive their fix to the problem is to hard wire non working devices by moving them close to an Eero device or to buy a new printer.  None of which were tenable solutions.  For $530 my expectation is that I'll have wifi and not have to hard wire anything - or purchase additional equipment particularly if those same devices worked seamlessly with my $100 router.  In any event after working with Eero for quite some time I decided that it wasn't worth the expense or hassle.  I was told I couldn't return it because now it was past 30 days.    On black Friday they offered $100 off a system.  I again wrote the company suggesting they provide the credit and I would apply it to a additional single Eero - cost $150 - so I could hardwire my printer.  I'd still be out of.pocket $50 but I thought it to be a fair compromise.  I was told no they can't do that.    So now I a writing this review to ensure that this does not happen to anyone else.  BTW this is a relatively new HP printer - pretty mainstream. ",

"John K. Dragoon","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I live in a brownstone condo in downtown Boston.  A crowded area with a lot of competition for bandwidth, channels and frequencies.  My Apple Router worked ok when in range but couldn't reach the 2nd floor.  An additional Apple Airport Extreme as an extender worked ok not great.  Hence my search for the Eero.  Given the overcrowded competition for 2.4 ghz in my neighborhood I configured a 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wireless network on the Apple router and was able to choose which of the two networks I could join in my condo based on signal strength.  The 5 ghz network FAR outperformed the 2.4 ghz at speeds over 100 mps download for the 5 vs 10 mps or less on the 2.4 ghz network.    While the setup of the Eero was easy, there is NO option to configure both a 2.4 and 5 ghz network  The router simultaneously broadcasts both and chooses for you which network, based on signal strength it connects to.  I want the ability to override the automatic connection and force a connection to the 5 ghz Eero network given the speed advantages.  Unfortunately you can't do that. I called Eero tech support and they are aware of the limitation with no commitment to fix.    While I love the improved signal strength of the Eero mesh throughout my condo, my inability to choose connection to a 5 ghz network (and therefore suffer much slower speeds) is a major drawback.    Net, if you depend or strongly prefer 5 ghz wireless networks - you will not be able to choose this as default option on Eero. ",

"Amazon Customer","April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"I was excited to get the Eero to replace my Asus RT N66U router and two Netgear extenders.

I placed two Eeros downstairs within 40 ft of each other (one in the office and one in the living room) and the other upstairs (this one was also approximately 40 ft of both in a straight line). No matter where I placed the 3rd Eero upstairs, the reception was too poor and setup could not be completed.    Setup with the app was super easy and I was looking forward to not having to switch between extenders when moving from one floor to the next.

"Amazon Customer","January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Good solution, if you are all wireless, but it cannot handle a mix between wired and wireless.    When setting it up initially, while the second unit was in line of sight (had an unobstructed view) of the first unit, where my old equipment was installed, and even although it was plugged into Ethernet, it could not connect.  I had to move it closer to the first unit, then it could connect.  Upstairs, it could not connect at all, since there was no line of sight, even although it was connected via Ethernet. I measured the downstairs connectivity of the 2 units and the network seemed slightly stronger than my Apple-based router/extender (hence the second star), but i will have to return the package, since I cannot get the third unit to work.  Based on the schematics on eero's site, I assume I would need 5-6 units to get my two-story 2,000 sqft home to work, and it's just not worth the investment.

I am very happy with the fairly easy set-up, relocating, changing the network from old to new. I bought the rectangle 3pack at a local electronics store. then ordered another single here from amazon for upstairs front of our house. Probably not necessary, but I like assurance of having a nice strong signal no matter where it is at home. The signal that was null outside my rear slider is now strong, we are able to use the WiFi at home carelessly now.One of the remote mesh unit -  I have connected to a stream daddy using an eithernet connnection.

I installed the Eero, which was a LOT easier than I expected (it took me 15 minutes to install three), and after placing them and only wiring one of them to the internet, I went from spotty coverage all over the house with occasional disconnects to a solid 125MB/sec all over the house.

Our house had been pre-wired for Dial Up in the nineties, which we found out to be obsolete and an expert told us about the mesh system and we installed a new direct line to the Frontier modem and from there after bridging the router via an gigabit switch to the new eero system.  We are very satisfied with the results as we are using lots of computers and TVs throughout the house. Since the system has been installed there was no need for re setting the modem/router anymore.

The coverage in my long condo is consistent in all corners and rooms.  I am very pleased with the devices.  Stylish and clean looking.    I'd like to see more reporting in the app on performance within the network.

The second Eero I attempted to install in the mid-level wouldn't connect.  Proceeding to the third box, in the top level just above our basement Eero, it connected fine.  Then I attempted the second box again and no problems.    Basically, you have to be prepared to let Eero build your network over again.    But now we have full bandwidth everywhere in our house. We went from 50/50 in the basement and 12ish elsewhere to 58/52 everywhere. Just a couple weeks later and now our only problem is our ISP.

My system would not reliable see the QNAP/Twonky setup, and throughput degraded from 30 to as low as .5 on the higher and lower floors.  I installed five eeros throughout the house, and within hours throughput downloads were 25+ throughout the house, and all devices are able to see and manage the music on the QNAP/Twonky.  Saved me literally thousands of dollars, as I had been told by one consultant that my only option was to wire the entire house, which would have cost a fortune.

"Jay A. Warren","April 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I had a specific reason for purchasing the eero wifi product... blanketing my home with Wifi signal so I could reliably use the Wifi Calling mode on my iPhone.  In particular, I wanted a system with zero handoff so I could move to anywhere I had Wifi coverage in my house without dropping a phone call.  And eero does this quite well.  I have absolutely zero cellular coverage at my home from any carrier.    Prior to purchasing my eero system I tried many times to configure my many Wifi routers and access points distributed throughout my home.  Although it was easy enough to get less expensive routers to cooperate enough to work together, there was no way to accomplish the zero handoff.  Until eero, I consistently dropped calls as I moved from one Wifi connection to another in my home.    By using a lan scanning program, you can see that eero uses the same SSID and channel number for the Wifi router and access points, and uses the same channel for all 2.4 ghz access and all 5 ghz access respectively.    Setup is easy, but manual configuration is limited... although with the smooth automatic configuring to allow cooperation between access points I did not feel limited in what I needed to do.    To sum up, I get very reliable Wifi coverage for my computers, smart home products, TV and video systems, and zero handoff for Wifi calling applications.  All with very good through-put, frequently maxing out the internet speed supplied by my ISP (see photo).  My only reason for not providing 5 stars is the system cost. ",

"Ziggy Zibrowski","September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"I work for an ISP and we recently began selling these systems at our retail locations.

Before the launch we set up Eeros at all the stores and began pulling 125m (I haven't been to one of the locations to check since last patch.) I'm paying for 25m Internet service at my apartment. Less than 20 feet from my modem, in my kitchen, I was lucky to get 5m, so after seeing what it did for our coverage in our stores, I decided to buy one for myself.

After purchasing this I'm now getting 30mb outside the door.  I placed the pucks in the same place as my extenders in my old system.

BrianInChicago,"June 10, 2016 ",5.0,"This is a game changer in terms of wifi. I know it's expensive and seems excessive but damn it the product just works.    Gone are the days of endless configurations and tweaks to get things right during setup. Also gone are the days of turning off my wifi in certain areas of the house or in the backyard because the signal is weak and it's better to just hop on a cell network.    You open the box and the equipment is laid out in steps - install this piece first and then the second and so forth. The app is clean and simple and will walk you through the entire process.    Coverage in our house has improved greatly since installing eero units on each floor. Now all I need to do it double down and purchase a few more; that's the only downside, cost. I believe you get what you pay for and you will pay for great home network coverage. ",
"P. K.","December 7, 2016 ",5.0,"Ok, I've had these in place for a few months now. Long enough to have an opinion.    First of all, they are very &#34;Appleish&#34; in the design and appearance. Even the packaging. It is quite nice. Assuming you have an iphone or ipad to run the app on, the setup is very simple and nearly foolproof. To be fair, I didn't try the Android app but based on other reviews, it appears that the ios app is more refined. They have simplified the product setup (perhaps too much?) and made it a breeze for anyone, even without technical knowledge, to get these up and running quickly and painlessly.    Once the 3 APs are up and connected to each other, &#34;it just works&#34;. Bravo! I can attest that these absolutely fixed WiFi dead spots and weak signals throughout my house. I replaced an Asus 802.11ac router/AP with these and the difference has been fantastic. Yes, yes... I know, some of you are screaming about &#34;if you know how to configure.. blah blah blah&#34;. I know how to configure it - I've got many many years and all the silly certificates and whatnot. That isn't the issue.    The app has a really nice indicator with status and how many devices are connected. One very nice addition is the speed test. You &#34;pull down&#34; the screen and it runs a speed test and displays the results right in the app. Nice touch. I also like that I can create and share a guest network in seconds with the app. Very nice. The lack of physical ports on the devices isn't that big a deal. A cheap switch plugged into one of those solves that problem forever.    Now for the not so great...    Because this is simplified for anyone to get it up and running and even manage it, it lacks some advanced features or tweaks. I have some wireless devices that are a little bit finicky. A thermostat for example works like a champ on 2.4 GHz but has erratic connectivity on 5. Don't know why, it just does. The app would benefit from an &#34;expert mode&#34; or something like that where I could define those things. I also would like to have the option to define the channel being used. If that is some kind of magical &#34;we pick the best one for you&#34; type of thing, I'd like the option to see that data. Finally, lets talk about the price shall we? This is a pretty expensive product. You could get the same &#34;mesh&#34; functionality from Ubiquiti's UniFi or use some power-line devices if you just need to connect a couple of devices away from your modem. WiFi range extenders are a cheaper option although they aren't nearly as slick or reliable.    Then we have this awful moment;  The 2 devices that aren't wired directly into my modem would randomly disconnect and show a red status light. They'd come back after 30-60 seconds but this constant up/down cycle went on for days. Instead of fussing with it, I fired up the app, navigated through the help section and emailed support with the information requested. Then --- crickets. No acknowledgement, no reply, no help. searching some internet forums, I'm not the only one to have this issue. I basically had to remove everything and go through the setup routine all over again while moving the 2 wireless APs around a little bit to get  a better signal. Not exactly sure why it ran fine for so long then suddenly became unstable, but it did.    I thought the lack of any response from support may have just been an oversight so I followed up the original ticket with a second request. Nothing again. Unfortunately, it appears that email support is non-existent. I didn't call the phone number but, I don't think I should have to. These are not cheap by any measure. Maybe the time, money, and effort put into the pretty packaging would have been better spent ensuring that customer support was top notch. I'd rather the product came in a brown paper bag and get stellar customer support than pretty packaging but nobody to answer my email.    Overall, if you care about aesthetics and you want to cover a large area with seamless WiFi, this is a great product. If you are more price sensitive, take a look at some of the alternatives. And finally, if you are not comfortable with suspect customer service, you may want to wait while, what I assume are growing pains, are resolved before you purchase. ",
WWWWoodchuck,"August 22, 2016 ",5.0,"Perfect solution to cover a large two-story house.  We have heavy users (streaming video, game systems, multiple phones, tablets, laptops, DVRs, etc.) at every corner of the house and the three pack covers everything very nicely.  It did take 24 hours and a firmware update to get to full speed, but it took care of itself.  Running the microwave used to make every wifi device pause, but not anymore!    A setup tip:  The quality of the system is sensitive to the placement of each unit.  If a unit is not getting a good signal, try moving it 6 inches in any direction. One unit had a very poor connection when placed behind a speaker, but moving to the side on the speaker allowed a full strength signal and full speed.    A bonus - the most recent update added the ability for family control.  The kids' devices can be set to Pause each night - no more sneaking videos after bedtime. ",

Now, it in only one and with a incredible wifi coverage. It is a bit expensive, but for now I don't know any other system that works that well. There is some points that should be updated as the speed test (which is not accurate) and the possibility to manage the network when you are away (specially for manage my kids connections).

I encountered 2 issues when I first set up my Eeros. First is the need for a US mobile phone number to create an Eero account Thankfully, there are online solutions for this requirement. Just google for it. The second issue is that Eero is unable to directly connect to my fibre network point because my network provider uses vlan tagging for the internet signal.

While customer support was very responsive and friendly, I basically had to find my own way to update the firmware on one recalcitrant unit.

First off, all of my computers are downloading faster; I actually feel bad for blaming Time Warner Cable for slow speeds when I know now that it was my crappy Wi-Fi router all along. But my networked hard drive copies faster, my iPhone doesn't drop connections with my my Sonos speakers or my Chromecast TV, and I've gotten rid of all the Ethernet wires that I was using because I didn't trust wireless connections.

Previous setup has Apple airport extremes (one downstairs & second one upstairs; connected through an ethernet cable). Switching between access points never worked flawlessly in the previous setup & there was bad coverage at the back of the house. This all seems to be solved after switching to three eero devices. ",

"E. Hansen","November 10, 2016 ",5.0,"I am moderately tech savvy but even with my limited skill set I had absolutely no problem setting up the eero system.  I live in a 3000 sf, 2 story house and it has been a challenge keeping all of the devices (6 Smart TVs, Smart phones, printers, computers, tablets, door bell system, Amazon Fires) working and keeping enough of a signal to stream video, gaming etc.  Since I installed the system, I have not had one drop out on any one of the devices.  A huge shout out to the inventors! Thanks. ",
"Amazon Customer","July 8, 2016 ",5.0,"Disregard the techie people who say you don't need this. I have been using extenders and other products for my large home. They are all terrible.  I set this system up in under 10 minutes and it works beautifully. I can now stream video anywhere in my house.  This product is expensive but a one time cost only. Now I'm getting the high speed internet I pay for!  Getting 90mb/s in the far corners of my house. If you have wifi issues this is a great solution and is very easy to set up using their app. If you can afford to pay for high speed internet every month you certainly can afford this. ",
yaritomo,"September 30, 2016 ",5.0,"Attractive industrial design, fantastic software UI/UX, easy setup, rock-solid reliability and performance. This blows traditional routers out of the water and I'm amazed. You can tell the product was made by people who care and were out to solve once and for all the headaches of home wifi systems. Might be a bit overkill for smaller homes/apartments, but worth every penny in terms of performance and peace of mind. ",
"Steve in Seattle","March 24, 2016 ",5.0,"This product is GREAT.  We have a 5,000sq ft house on two levels.  For years we have had several access points in the home, and have relied on our mobile phones and tablets to lock on to the best one depending on what room we're in.  Stuttering videos, slow browsing, and sometimes just no access are problems we've had through several versions of this kind of setup.  FINALLY, I sprung for a 3-pack of these, and I can tell you, I have FULL BARS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE HOUSE.  It really does work as advertised.  If you have the problems I've mentioned, you should get a set of these and all that will be history.  I'm a licensed ham radio operator, and I was skeptical, but this actually does what you think it is supposed to do. ",
"none of your business","April 13, 2017 ",5.0,"Eero  is amazing. It works exactly as marketed, which is very rare with technology oriented products. Ever since installing the eero system we have not had a single dropped Internet connection, whereas before and it happen 3 to 4 times a day. The added features that come With the continual upgrades such as family filters are wonderful.  It's always fun to find a new product from a small company that solves the problem and does it better than those from the biggest people out there. ",
"Sarah Buell","December 23, 2016 ",5.0,"First let me say I do love this product.Was a little difficult to have them connect to start off. We have the main unit in our office which is in the front corner of our house. Master Bedroom is right above the office, but was initially difficult to get the two to pair. Eventually did. Third was in basement, again not to far away, to a couple tries, and eventually paired.  Once they were paired, I did move the 2nd and 3rd unit about 10-15 ft further, and they stayed connected.    Interface in app is very user friendly, and the steps for setup was easy to understand. My favorite thing is being able to see everyone on our internet connection. as well as now having a strong signal throughout the house. ",
"Jim Hood","April 4, 2016 ",5.0,"Trying to get a signal into all corners of our three-level house was never easy. I had to use two routers but even then there were dead spots, not to mention the necessity of running cable to the second router. I never found a wireless booster that would work as advertised and always had to revert to cabling the second router. eero changed all that. I unpacked the three eero routers and within 15 minutes, they were working perfectly without any need to fiddle with complex settings.    The app that accompanies the routers is very useful. Among other things, it lets you see each device that is on the network, its name, IP address, etc. This makes it much easier to get wireless printers, etc., working and troubleshoot them when they get cranky. ",
JLA76,"September 12, 2016 ",3.0,"Eero talks as if these are going to be the greatest thing ever. That's just simply not the case. Ultimately, these are just normal wifi access points. They didn't go through everything, like they said they would; they didn't just instantly handle themselves, like they said they would; I ended up having to hardwire all three of mine, and put them into bridge mode to work with my Fiber. Outside of that, they work fine. But, I could have done this with my old Apple WAPs. ",
"eero support","November 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Amazing!  Since I live in a town house I ordered 2 of the eero devices.  I received them and within 10 minutes I had them both up and running and my broadband speed jumped from in the 40 to 50 ran to over 100 in my speed tests.  Tweaking is a breeze with the app, and I do not miss my Apple Airport at all.  Would recommend to anyone that wants a painless set up this is the device for you. ",
"Robert K. Maze","December 23, 2016 ",3.0,"It just works. The highest compliment I can give. My other routers needed intense time to set up and over an hour with customer service to make it work.    This is just plug and play and updates itself. I bought five of them. Yes more expensive but well worth the mental health of dealing with routers that are so temperamental. Nice phone people too. I called them with questions before I made my purchase. ",
Daktotten,"April 19, 2017 ",5.0,"This is clearly the easiest and most effective product available for providing WiFi in a larger home.  I actually installed 5 units in a 5000 SF home, but I have seamless Wifi everywhere.  The 4th and 5th units were a bit tricky, since I needed a software update.  The first 3 were extremely easy using the App on my iPhone.  Highly recommend this product for anyone requiring WiFi in a older, larger home (who cannot use hard wiring). ",
"Tom S.","April 1, 2017 ",5.0,"It's as easy to set up and amazing as advertised. I've had a dead zone in my house that I couldn't resolve with any other wifi extender and it worked with the eero. Worth the price. ",
HBSURFDOC,"January 23, 2017 ",5.0,"The Good: The Eero is a great wifi extender. I live in a split ranch house which has 3 levels and is approximately 100 feet from end to end on the main level. It's also almost 60 years old and built with material much more impervious to wifi signals than modern construction. I've tried numerous wifi routers and range extenders in an attempt to provide coverage throughout my house and, until Eero, they all failed miserably with large dead zones in various regions of the house that couldn't be eliminated no matter what I tried. Eero is the first system that I found that is able to provide not only wifi coverage, but a strong signal, throughout every room in my house. Why then am I only giving it 1 star?    The Bad: Unfortunately, both Eero software and documentation are incredibly buggy. Moreover, even when a more recent version of the software is released, the customer cannot initiate or force their devices to update and instead must wait for the update to be pushed out to their units by the Eero rolling system. In fact, I've been unable to get the update to the latest released version of the software even after contacting technical support to report an issue that I was having. This brings me to the the other major reason for my 1 star rating, customer and/or technical support, or more correctly the near absence of this support. In a little over a week, I've contacted Eero 3 times. The first time, I received a boilerplate response from their website that was totally unresponsive to the issue I raised. Not only did the text on the Eero website not contain the appropriate information that I required to install/setup the Eero system on my network but also my reply to Eero indicating that their boilerplate response didn't address the question that I specifically asked was completely ignored with no further answer or information provided. It was only through trial and error that I was able to figure out the steps that I needed to take to setup the Eero system. After completing the initial setup, I needed to open some ports on the Eero for forwarding of specific Internet communication to other devices running on my system. I soon discovered that this also didn't work as described. I again contacted Eero support, only to be told that their system indicated that the ports I was attempting to forward were indeed open. Still I could not get external communication to work. Ultimately, I discovered that, due to a bug in their software, even if your device only requires/uses TCP communication, you have to open both the TCP and UDP protocols on the port before Eero with correctly forward the communication to the appropriate device. I recontacted Eero support and was told that they're &#34;aware of this issue.&#34; Finally, I noticed that, concurrent with replace my router with Eero, my network developed terrible latency issues in communication between local devices. Devices that had near instantaneous response with the old router were now taking 2 to 6 seconds to respond and this delay was causing both software and hardware to fail. I again contacted technical support. It took 2 days to get a response, which was to escalate the issue. It took another 2 days before I heard for the escalation agent and this response just asked for more specifics on my system, which I immediately sent. Now 6 days after I originally reported the problem and 4 days after it was supposedly escalated, I'm still waiting on a response that would actually help me resolve the problem.    In summary, if it happens to work with your network out of the box, Eero is an outstanding wifi system. However, you're on your own if it doesn't. The document is inadequate, the software is buggy, and technical support is virtually non-existent. As a result, I cannot recommend this system for non-IT professionals.    Edit: 02/08/2017 - Eero now allows the user to initiate a manual update instead of waiting for the update to be rolled out to the device. ",
"Gerald Barber","May 11, 2016 ",5.0,"Fantastic wifi system.  I am using four of the eero pods throughout the house, and I have excellent coverage over three floors.  I used the Speakeasy.net speed test and had 768 meg downloads and 568 meg uploads in every room in the house!!  I have recommended to several colleagues and they have had similar success.  I would like to be an investor if possible.  This is a terrific new product. ",
"eero Support","September 15, 2016 ",3.0,"I have had trouble covering my entire house for years and have tried EVERYTHING.  Nothing worked. Watching Netflixs, Amazon, etc. was a nightmare as each app would &#34;buffer&#34; periodically.  What a hassle!  I had pretty much given up and considered rewiring my house with ethernet so that I could place routers in each area of the house.  When I read the reviews about eero, I was skeptical but desperate.  Knowing that Amazon has a good return policy, I took the risk.  eero arrived and was incredibly easy to set up.  I have been watching Netflixs, Amazon, etc. while having Sonos playing in another room and EVERYTHING WORKS.  It has now been a couple of weeks and NO BUFFERING.  We are extremely happy and look forward to eeros continuing to make their product even better.  This is a game changer! ",
"Nathan K.","April 12, 2016 ",5.0,"Upgraded from a single router that performed ok, but struggled with signal strength and reliability.  I've had the Eero running a couple of weeks, and signal and reliability have been rock solid.    Installation was exceptional, I understand routers and how to configure them, but it was nice to not have to deal with any of that, and just have something that sets itself up. ",
