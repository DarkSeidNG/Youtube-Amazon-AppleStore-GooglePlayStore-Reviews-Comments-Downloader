"Roy Estaris","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.  Happy Holidays  Roy ",
DJ,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.    If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!    Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.    1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.    2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.    3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, &#34;Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees&#34; got no result, so I tried &#34;Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees&#34; and she picked it up perfectly.    4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.    5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  &#34;Alexa, play 90s music&#34;, &#34;Alexa, play indie music&#34;, and &#34;Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds&#34;.  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great &#34;freebie&#34; if you're a prime member.    6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.    7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.    8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to &#34;Alexa, what's the definition of&#34;, &#34;Alexa, how far away is&#34;, &#34;Alexa, Wikipedia&#34; (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask &#34;Alexa, tell me more&#34;).  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.    9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).    Suggestions for Improvement:    1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like &#34;How far away is the sun&#34; but I'd really like too see Amazon add a &#34;search&#34; function.    2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.    3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings. ",
"Bryant R.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.  A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.  So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.  The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.  I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.  Thanks for letting me rant ",
RaVen,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!  This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say &#34;alexa&#34; and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.    We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its &#34;multi-room voice recognition&#34; technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word &#34;alexa&#34; on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a &#34;multi-device&#34; plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited      The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.  The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.    At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is &#34;alexa turn on the lights&#34; and our downstairs lights spring into action.    My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with &#34;sorry I didn't get that&#34;  Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.    Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your &#34;free&#34; music.    I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up &#34;New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing&#34; under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.    I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device. ",
"Brian C","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.    I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.    My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo &#34;skills&#34; that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the &#34;skills&#34; not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.    Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.    The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached. ",
Andrew,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"This was my first Echo purchase and I am overall very pleased with it's performance. Initially, I was worried that it was going to be a Siri knockoff with only a limited number of voice commands and functions with constant errors; however, I have not received single error response since I have owned it. I am an Amazon Prime member and from the time I clicked confirm purchase to the time it was delivered to my doorstep only took 3 days, and best part of all, shipping was free.    I currently have mine sitting by my bed and have synced it with the app, available on for all phone types, which allows me to carry out a number of voice commands including: &#34;Alexa, set an alarm for..., check the weather, play Pandora, or tell me a joke.&#34; The app interface is a little clunky at times, but you're able to see the history of recent requests, and Alexa is constantly learning and adapting to your specific commands and style.    If you are looking to buy an Echo Dot because you want a cheap introduction into Bluetooth connectivity with household lights, televisions, gaming systems, thermostats, or other Echo products then buy this Echo Dot. I am working with a grad student budget, and for $50 dollars this sleek and sexy &#34;command station&#34; was worth every penny. I did not receive any compensation for this review, I am writing it because I debated on buying one for about a week before pulling the trigger, and I just want to speed up the process for people like me who may be waffling...trust me, its completely worth the $50.

"Amazon Customer","December 14, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly, I love mine but obviously, there are some things that could be better. What do I love about it? Both my boyfriend and I downloaded the app and have access to a shopping list that we can both use at the grocery store depending on who is there. With a simple wake up word (her name) and the command of adding an item to the shopping list, it appears in the app. I can ask for a flash briefing and NPR news is retrieved and I am caught up all over the world in subjects from politics all the way to sports news. She also gives great weather information so that I am able to plan for my day ahead. Alexa can learn many skills that continue to evolve. Knowledge from what wines to pair with what meats and good cooking substitutes to helping with a drinking game and other games & trivia. Alexa comes in handy when I need a hands-free timer in the kitchen or an alarm for a nap. Now, what I don't really like but can get passed it once I get the hang of it. Sometimes you ask a question but she doesn't understand the question but you reword the question and she is able to understand it. So just be sure your wording the question correctly. Also, remember that Alexa is always listening. ",
"Kathryn H.","March 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Love the Echo Dot. I got the buy 3 discount, which makes it worth while. I am sure there will be more things added and improved on in time, but so far it is a bit limited in what I can use it for. We don't have a modern set up in our house so that it can adjust lights or temp so that part is useless to us.  I got it mostly for my 93 year old mother whom I take care of, as she constantly asks me what day or time it is, so now she can ask the Echo. I also like the ability to get a weather report for the day, and I still need to set up the calendar for daily events for mom, once I get that set up it will be another great advantage in having this. I hope they can come up with a way to make this an intercom also between rooms so that if she needs me at any time Echo can alert me in some way. That alone would make this a really great item worth five stars.  So far my favorite feature is the radio, I just ask it to play a particular type of music and it comes on. You do have to be specific about how to get the type of music you want to hear rather than just ask it to play a particular genre. I also like that you can vocally tell it to turn down or up the volume, and to skip the song playing and it goes to the next one. I don't use it to shop with, might be helpful to some. Also, it does take a little adjusting to the way some people speak, my voice is clear but moms is a little muffles so it took a few times of asking questions to get it use to her voice, now it works good for her. The distance to where it can hear you is good and volume on answering and music is great, you don't really need added speakers unless you want to hear it over a very large room, or whole house.  Pros: Received quickly with free Prime shipping, ability to play music, ask for date, time, and weather without touching anything, get answeres to a lot of questions, and the ability to update and improve over time. Volume is great for small to medium size rooms, and several feet away form it. Great price for 3.  Cons: Still some limitations, no intercom set up yet, need to be specific about where to get radio from. ",
Vince,"April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I have the regular Echo and it's amazing. I bought the Echo Dot for my dad who had been using a little antenna radio around the house. This isn't mobile but it allows him to play Pandora or just to tell it what kind of music to play. It was purchased through my account but I created an Amazon account for him so I could link Pandora to it. That way he has his own Pandora account. Echo can switch accounts at any time with a voice command but we keep them on the primary users' account. I was worried the audio quality wouldn't be any good based on reviews but it's really not bad at all if you're replacing a little radio. It's not audiophile fill the room with brilliance quality, but it gets the music out and doesn't sound tinny or anything. My dad really enjoys it. ",
"Marquino Gadget guru","April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"This is what I`ve been waiting for!!!!  It is simple amazing what you can do with technology nowadays, Amazon is always innovating and staying on top with technology.  This new Amazon Echo Dot does what it says it does and provides all the necessary information by simply asking!  We like it to much i got a second device to add it in my room, been able to connect to your Bluetooth speakers and devices you can automate lots of things.  Great job Amazon ",
Aphonic,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"The far field mic in the second gen do the is way better than the full size echo.  Now if they could just use a source for weather that was even remotely accurate I'd be happy.  Accuweather is ten degrees off a tank my location always. Minimum.  The dot works well.  It's a good cheap way to get alexa.  The speaker quality is fine for audio books and news briefings. Not for music.  It seems faster to respond than the full size echo (1st generation). I believe it's a better option to buy this and pair a nice bt speaker than buy the full echo st this point.  One star off for missing some basic features.  Like accurate weather and basic google searching.  It's useful for my home automation but I still  Find the echo line of products of very limited use outside of that.  Good for a kitchen timer or wake up  Alarm.  Good for some news.  Needs much better podcast management to be very useful.  Oh yah. And accurate weAther.  Amazon prime music is a. Nice touch as is music unlimited for the echo at $3.99 a month. ",
"LUCY  Von","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I got Dot about a week after the big Echo from my son as a gift. We set her up and all was fine. Until nothing eas fine anymore 😢 . She would respond initially, but not always though, and when she was playing music she would not respond to the wake word. At all. I reset, few times, but nithing worked. I called Amazon. Within minutes they had me connected to Echo's tech support, and in no time did we have Dot fixed. They reset her factory settings with me. We tested and now our darling little Dot is happy and healthy! So call Amazon if you do have issues, it's a matter of setup or wifi or in any case, something that they can fix. Wonderful support for a wondrful device. I do wish I could call her Dot though. Or a name that I choose. Because now I have two Alexa's in one household 🤔, and calling her Echo or Amazon ain't gonna work for me 😢. Please vote my review up if you liked it. ",
"Kindle Customer","April 20, 2017 ",4.0,"EDIT: All thanks to Amazon's customer service, I learned why my Echo was not working. It must be 8&#34; -12&#34; away from a wall. Our Echo Dot works when against an interior wall but not against an exterior wall where it had previously been situated. We adore &#34;Alexa&#34; and hope the Echo Dot will soon add a great speaker to its features. For the price, this is a fantastic device. And, it's diminutive size makes it easy to use. Still, our family prefers full-size Echo. Thanks, Amazon for the email help with Echo Dot!  *****  We are an Amazon device family. And, with the exception of this device, have had wonderful experiences.    Echo Dot remains connected until the next time I use it. Literally, I reconnect Echo Dot to our network, ask it a few questions, play some music, walk away. When I return Echo has spontaneously disconnected itself and requires the reconnection procedure again.    We have two full size Echos and have no connection issues with them. They operate flawlessly. ",
"Lantana Al","January 11, 2017 ",5.0,"Amazon Echo is a great device (I was one of the first to have one and waiting for months for my first Echo to ship as Amazon vastly underestimated the demand for a device like this) and the Echo Dot (2nd generation) is fantastic in its size and capability (I bought a six pack to get one free). There is no volume ring on the 2nd gen Dot like there is on the original Echo and the 1st gen Echo Dot but it's no big deal as there are volume buttons now and the cost of the volume ring wasn't worth it if you ask me (it was nice, but for most people not worth the money). Most of the time you'll want to adjust the volume by voice anyway (like &#34;Alexa volume 5&#34;). The 2nd gen Echo Dot is also available in white but I'm sticking with black. UPDATE: I actually prefer the cheaper volume buttons on the Dot 2 to the volume ring now.    The fact that you can just talk from across the room and it can hear you (most of the time) really sets this apart. If you think you already have an Echo because you have Siri, Cortana, or Google, then know that it's just not the same.    Things I do: set timers, set alarms, get weather info, ask basic questions, listen to music (like Prime Music, Prime Stations, songs I bought, etc), listen to radio, ask for jokes, turn things on and off, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some things. The Echo really excels at playing music. I love it than I can ask for a song I want to hear and it will play it (most of the time anyway). At night I often listen to a local radio station and I just say &#34;Alexa stop&#34; without having to get out of bed when I want to stop listening.    When I listen to Prime Station I can tell it &#34;thumbs up&#34; if I like the song or &#34;thumbs down&#34; if I don't... and when I listen to the station again it won't play the songs that I've thumbed down.    Using the built-in speaker, the sound quality is decent for voice. For music you'll want to connect it to a speaker system because the Dot's small internal speaker is weak. I do wish I could AirPlay to a device from the Echo when I'm playing music and want the best sound quality, however Bluetooth is pretty impressive when it uses the near-CD quality codecs.    Positives:  * The new feature that Amazon added (ESP - Echo Spatial Perception) so that the nearest Echo responds is fantastic. I was also very happy to hear that the first generation Echoes will also support this in the next firmware update (I think devices are updating now). From my research, if the Echo app shows that you have a device software version greater than 4008 then you should have the update with ESP support. Unfortunately there does seem to be a minor downside: the Echo's response can sometimes be slightly delayed while multiple Echoes figure out which Echo is closest and should respond.  * It seems to hear better when playing music than the first gen. It was annoying when you would try to talk to it while it was playing but it couldn't hear you. The new Dot hears better during music playback but it's still not &#34;Star Trek quality&#34; hearing; sometimes you may still need to raise your voice.  * It's relatively cheap and well worth the asking price.  * It has a 3.5mm stereo audio jack, which I use with two of my Dots to connect to the line-in on one of my computers and another to the line-in on an old compact stereo/CD player. Sound quality should be good enough for anyone except audiophiles.  * Some people complain of connection issues, but all of my Echoes stay connected without issue to my&nbsp;Asus RT-AC68U&nbsp;router.  * If you want to 'Wikipedia' something then you can say 'Alexa, Wikipedia &#60;subject&#62;'. She'll read a little from Wikipedia. If you want her to read more after she stops then just say 'Alexa, tell me more'. This can be useful sometimes.    Negatives (mostly minor but take note):  * Warranty is only 90 days. I think it should be 1 year. Of course they will sell you a SquareTrade 1, 2, or 3 year warranty for $5/year if you want. Perhaps another cost-cutting move.  * The shiny (glossy) black surface can be a fingerprint magnet but you probably won't be touching it often. The previous generation wasn't glossy.  * I had trouble configured my 2nd Echo Dot (the first one went fine). The Alexa app (on Android) gave me the cryptic message &#34;Authorization expired. Please reconnect your phone to the internet, log out from the app and retry&#34;. Got it several times. I resolved it by signing out of the Alexa app and then signing back in, having to re-enter my email and password.... annoying... and I wonder why I didn't have this issue setting up my first Echo Dot just minutes prior???? Oh well. UPDATE: This just happened again on another day when setting up two more Echo Dots. This first Echo Dot setup went fine, but on the second one I got the &#34;Authorization expired.&#34; message again. Beware of this issue if setting up more than one Echo Dot.  * While trying out Amazon Music Unlimited with the Echo I immediately ran into the issue of the Echo playing the explicit version of songs instead of the clean version. There should be an option to never play explicit songs and to play the clean version instead (some people have children). The workaround until Amazon addresses this problem is to add the clean song to your music library and then say &#34;Alexa play &#60;song&#62; from my library&#34;.  * This doesn't affect me, but the Echo does not support enterprise networks that require centralized network authentication with a login. Some might want to know this (like teachers who might want to use it in a school that uses this type of network authentication).  * The Android Amazon Alexa app can be slow and frustrating sometimes. For example, when launching it sometimes just sits there on the intro screen and spins forever until you shut down the app and restart it again.  * Doesn't hear well in a noisy environment, or when other people (including on TV) are talking at the same time.    Home Automation:  * I use several&nbsp;Belkin WeMo&nbsp;switches to control some lights and fans. They work pretty well although not always perfectly. Fortunately they work better now after all the firmware updates.  * I can control my Honeywell WiFi thermostats using the &#34;Honeywell Total Connect Comfort&#34; skill. I have two downstairs for 2 zones. I have one&nbsp;Honeywell RTH9580WF1005/W1&nbsp;and one&nbsp;Honeywell RTH6580WF.  * I recently set it up to turn on and off certain activities with a&nbsp;Logitech Smart Hub. For example, I can say &#34;Alexa, turn on TiVo&#34; and it will turn on the TV and my receiver and set the TV and receiver inputs correctly. I can then use the remote which is synced... and turn it all off with &#34;Alexa turn off TiVo&#34;. There were some annoyances getting it all setup but I think it's pretty &#34;cool&#34; even though you can only start and stop activities with Alexa so you still need the remote to do other things (change channel, adjust volume, mute, pause, etc).  * I think I've only really scratched the surface of what is possible with home automation. I have not tried IFTTT (&#34;if this then that&#34;) recipes yet but I hear it is quite powerful and hope to try it out when I have more time to &#34;play&#34;.    Wishes:  * High-quality digital audio output that is better than Bluetooth. If it had this then you could really get high quality audio output from it, but most people probably don't really care that much as analog out is &#34;good enough&#34;.  * Smarter. After 2 years I wish the Echo was smarter. Yes, it has definitely improved over time but Google can still answer more questions than Alexa. It's going to be hard to beat Google in answering general questions.  * Weather alerts. I suggested this a long time ago and they still haven't added it... perhaps due to legal reasons? If would be great if it would sound some sort of alarm or notification for severe weather.  * Built-in support for notifying others that you might need help. This would be good for the elderly. There is a &#34;Ask My Buddy&#34; skill however, but the verbiage is a little awkward (&#34;Alexa, Ask My Buddy to Send Help&#34;) and it's free so if the developer decides to stop support then that might leave a lot of people without service at an inopportune time.    Compared to Google Home (which I just bought):  * Setup on Google Home was super-simple, easier than Echo (the Android app worked really well and setup seemed streamlined)  * Google Home is smarter for general questions... significantly smarter. I asked Google &#34;How long does it take to get to the Honda dealer in Lewisville&#34; and it told me about 26 minutes in current traffic conditions. Awesome. The Echo totally failed here.  * No AUX audio output like on Echo Dot  * I prefer saying &#34;Alexa&#34; to &#34;OK Google&#34; as the wake word (UPDATE: &#34;Hey Google&#34; works now too!)  * I currently prefer Echo for music and smart home control but I consider Google Home a serious threat to Echo because it is more &#34;intelligent&#34; than Echo    Other:  * It doesn't come with a 3.5mm audio cable but I can understand why as many people would probably not use it and Amazon wants to get the cost as low as possible so this isn't a big deal.  * The USB power cable is about 5 feet.  * The 1st gen Echo Dot was almost double the price. I feel a little disappointed that they now have a 2nd gen that is overall better for much less money... and that it came out very shortly after the 1st gen Echo Dots.  * You don't need any other Echo units to use the Dot... some people might think you do but this is just like the &#34;big Echo&#34;, only without the &#34;big&#34; sound. Instead a little speaker is included.  * It's USB powered and comes with a USB power adapter and USB cable. NOTE: If you use a USB power connection other than from the included power adapter then there could be power and/or sound quality issues. I had some sound quality issues (background noises) and eliminated them by switching to the included USB power adapter.  * About 10 or 15 minutes after setting it up, it said something like &#34;your Echo received an important update and must restart&#34;. So if you are having issues with it then you may want to give it awhile so it can update if needed.  * For better understanding of what you say, go to the Alexa app and Settings-&#62;Voice Training.  * I bought some of these powered bookshelf speakers, hooked them to the Echo Dot, and have been impressed with what you get for the money:&nbsp;Edifier R1280T Powered Bookshelf Speakers    While not perfect, I really like the Amazon Echo. I think the technology and potential is still in its infancy but the Echo is already really useful and excels at home automation, playing music, podcasts, and radio. Highly recommended, especially for the price. UPDATE: I'm reducing my rating from 4.5 to 4 stars due to Google Home being much smarter at answering general questions. The Echo is a good device but I think you should also seriously consider Google Home. ",
Artemaria,"April 13, 2017 ",4.0,"At first, I thought that this would just be like a voice-controlled Siri that is always on, but  after living with it for several months it seems as if it is so much more.  While not perfect, the speech recognition and accuracy are on a par with Google Assistant, and that accuracy along with the &#34;instant on&#34; feature is what makes this so easy to use.  The literature is not the clearest on this, but you don't really need a speaker for the Echo Dot, and we usually don't use it with the speaker, because the built in speaker is more than loud and clear enough for Alexa's speaking voice in the 20 x 16 room where we have it stationed.  If you want to play music and have the music sound rich and full, then you should hook it up to a nice Bluetooth speaker.  We use the Logitech Boom and it works very well, usually pairing flawlessly with the Echo Dot with very little effort, and great sound.    What makes the Echo Dot a little different and perhaps more fun to use than its competitors are the &#34;skills&#34; that are built into it.  I'm not going to go into the details of all the things that it can do because you can read about them on c/net or some other tech site, but what I will tell you is that there are alot of &#34;skills&#34; that are not at all pragmatic or useful, but that make the Echo Dot/Alexa alot more fun than the competition.  There's a storytelling feature, where Alexa will tell you a not so great bedtime story.  But what makes it so engaging are the thoughtfully interspersed comments in that story, such as &#34;no, you can't get any water,&#34; and &#34;that's your last story, and its time for you to go to sleep,&#34; which seem so human and so clever.  The Echo Dot/Alexa also will tell you the news, the weather and instantaneously provide any other current-events related information that you may want to hear while cooking dinner or getting dressed for work.    Along, these same lines, Alexa will tell you a joke, and will answer questions about various topics including about other AI platforms which she does in a polite and diplomatic fashion with a response like &#34;I like all AIs.&#34;  In reality, however, this is not true.  Neither Alexa, nor Google Assistant, nor Siri are true AIs.  They are merely the latest in voice recognition hardware and software that, through brute force algorithm calculations performed on a server far from your home, determines a high-probability acceptable response to the combination of words that served as its verbal input.  Because Alexa is cannot make any decisions on its own, it is not a true AI.  Thus, if your internet service is slow or off, Alexa will not work, leaving you with a $50 paperweight.  We've not had that issue, but it is something to consider if your internet service is not the best and you are considering buying this device.    In the end, this is a fun foray in to the world of voice-activated assistants.  And while Amazon's database of verbal input grows, paving the way for a true AI someday, Alexa may be the recognized as one of the first pioneering digital assistant devices that trained people to verbally interact with technology in their home.

NC-Ron,"October 24, 2016 ",4.0,"My wife and I had thought about getting Dots for the grand kids for Christmas but the reviews at that time were incomplete and confusing about what the dot would do and how they might interact/interfere with each other in the same household.  Well, we now own an Echo, a Tap and two Dots. They are all great.    Myth 1.  You do NOT need Echo to use a Dot. Dot is autonomous. It responds to Alexa commands just like Echo, and can control remote devices just as well.    Myth 2. You MUST have external speakers. Not so. The speaker in Dot is no great shakes, but it works. The audio output to a good set of powered speakers is great.    Myth 3. If you use Echo, or Dot or Tap, you cannot have two or more doing different things. Not so. I can have Alexa via Echo playing Clapton in the living room and have Alexa via Dot playing the Dead in the bedroom, at the same time, with just one Amazon Prime account, not even the Prime Music account.    Other:  Both Dot and Echo have to be plugged into 115 v all the time to work. The Tap is rechargeable and bluetooth so it is portable. Great feature. We use Echo and Dot to control TP-Link smart plugs and smart switches. They work great. (I love the TP-Link stuff, maybe another review. But Alexa at my house can control the smart stuff at our beach place 250 miles away. In fact you have to be precise in your language with Alexa or she'll be turning stuff on and off in the other location...)    I actually haven't tried the Tap yet with remotes (it's at the beach and I'm not), but I assume it will work just as well. The only caveat is that you have to 'enable remote' on the smart plugs, etc. in order to have Alexa turn them on and off. Some folks are leery about doing that. If I get hacked and some clown wants to turn off my bedroom light, so be it. (I can monitor the status of all the smart devices with the KASA app for TP-Link and my smart phone.)    Dot is a little bigger than a hockey puck and makes a great alarm clock. ",
ComputerGuy,"April 26, 2017 ",5.0,"For $50 and what it does, how can you go wrong? Answer is, you can't. This thing is awesome. Not a whole lot bigger than a hockey puck. With all the power of the Full Sized Echo less the better speaker. Since you can pair with a Blue Tooth Speaker or plug it in via cable which the full unit currently doesn't, there's really no downside to this thing. Setup in minutes, new skills easily added. 2 Million songs available if you have Amazon Prime. I've got it controlling a Smart LED Bulb I purchased a few days after I received the Echo Dot. I purchased a second one for my brother who's Bed Ridden in a care facility and he loves it. He's a Trivia and Facts Buff so he went to town using it to search Wikipedia for all sorts of info. He's also using it to play his favorite Radio Station.    If you are interested in this device, ignore the low rating reviews. The speaker is fine, yes it's small and not super powerful but there is no quality issue with it. It's like using a small portable radio (not a boombox). If you're an Audiophile or need loud music, hook it up to a stereo or high end Bluetooth speaker, don't trash it because it won't shake your windows with the built in speaker.    It's sound pickup is fine as well. I put one upstairs in my house and it can hear me from other rooms upstairs just fine. Unless you are talking like a mouse or have it blasting music or something making it hard for it to pickup your voice. I purchased a second for my downstairs part of the house and with it centrally located, I've got the entire house covered with 2 and it's always within range of my voice. My Girlfriend has a slight speech issue and it understands her fine too.    I may buy a 3rd to dedicate to my Home Entertainment center and plug it into the stereo. I should have purchased 3 with the promotion of getting $20 for buying 3, but I wanted to test one out first. In any case, even without the Buy 3 promotion, you still come in under the $176 for the Full echo. I don't have the full Echo so I can't compare, but from everything I've read, and what i've experienced with my Dots, I see nothing wrong with them and feel they are a major margin. And I don't feel the need to get the full unit at this point just to have a better speaker. ",
Manders,"March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"I like the Dot quite a bit, but it could be better. I'm not sure if it is the ALEXA program that the Dot connects to or if it is the Bing Search engine, I will have to do some more testing. Some times it can't find info it should be able to. Playing Music works Great!!! The Built in speaker is OK. But if you connect it to a really good speaker with either an Audio Cable or Bluetooth it sounds Great!! I am having the Dot read a Kindle book to me. It works well but the inflections in the text to speech program need work. However that is not a limitation of the device but of current technology. Getting local weather or movies works well. Alexa can &#34;learn&#34; other &#34;Skills&#34; but you have to tell Alexa to use the skill. It would be better if these skills were available all the time, and didn't have to be &#34;turned on&#34;. The Dot does not have a battery, so if you unplug it, it will need to search and connect to your WIFI again when you plug it back in. A great work around is to get a small battery pack (needs a least a 1 amp output port) and keep it plugged into the battery pack and then plug the battery pack into a wall charger. This allows the Dot to be truly portable. I had mine in my shirt pocket and was listening to a book while putting up Christmas lights outside for at least two hours. The Dot works Great, I am hoping that Alexa herself will get smarter. ",
Dion,"April 24, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought 16 of these and gave most of them out as Christmas presents. When I bought my first one in 2015 I was impressed with the questions I asked and the responses I received. These past 5 months or so I believe Alexia must have gone in for a lobotomy. Seldom understands the question. Upgraded to the Prime Music. For how large they say the music library is, I have it ask an average of 3 times before it sometimes plays the song I requested. Yes you can load all sorts of &#34;skills&#34; but they need to come up with a way to allow you to print or even e-mail the skills and commands to yourself. ",
"Bryan Warren","December 15, 2016 ",5.0,"So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable. Here's the basics. Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power. On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use. Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables.

william,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.    Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.    Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it. ",
"Chris Hockaday","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Biggest piece of junk ever. It worked great for 1 day.

I've googled everything I can think of to try but nothing works.  I get that stuff doesn't always work perfectly and has issues, but the biggest problem is that there is no customer support.

Yes, the new Fire Stick is Alexa-enabled, but I'd prefer one listening device rather than two.    I considered the Google product and chose the Amazon Echo instead. While Google may have better search capabilities, I'm pretty well covered between phone and computers.

TwistedTree,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Lasted just about 6 months, then started failing. We would give a command, and the dot would sit and think about answering. Stops in the middle of playing music.

Ask it to tell us a joke, it tells the joke, but stops before giving the punch line. We have a full size echo that works fine, and we have tried moving the dot next to the echo to see if it was having issues with the wifi range, no change. Reset to factory defaults and setup from scratch, no change. We finally contacted tech support, who where useless. Bounced us around to 4 different techs in less then 5 minutes, where hung up on then finally told the case would be escalated to tier 2 support.

I am a apple product geek but I do like giving all types of gadgets a try, so I can be more informed and well rounded. This is why I took advantage of getting this Echo Dot at the monthly payments that amazon offers.    First I had no idea it was sooo tiny. Despite that it has big sound, and if I chose to have it louder I would attach it to my bluetooth speakers.    I plugged it in, and downloaded the Alexa app to my iPhone. It was a bit complicated to get it attached (it took me about 2 minutes which I didn't like) but I suppose if I read the directions more carefully it would have been faster.    Alexa works so well. I put her in my bedroom. Just telling her to speak, set my alarm, turn on my favorite radio station is so easy.    Siri is the number one girl in my life, but Alexa has a special place in my heart.

"Amazon Customer","January 23, 2017 ",4.0,"I use the echo mainly for playing music and it is not very good at that. It has trouble finding songs that are otherwise available.

Alexa, next track, Alexa, next track . . . lo and behold, 5 more &#34;next tracks&#34; later and Black and Blue is playing. Alexa stop. Well, Alexa might stop or you might have to say stop 3 more times. And even if it stops, it might randomly start playing again which is very annoying if you are on a phone call. Or you say &#34;next track&#34; and it goes silent and is thinking and then it just continues playing the track it was on. I don't have a speech impediment. Voice text on my phone understands what I say. I don't know why this stupid hockey puck can't. And god forbid you want to play a classical piece. I have a lot of classical music in my library and it won't play by composer or artist. I have to use the app to play almost any classical music in my library which defeats the purpose of the echo. I may as well just play it on the computer.  We use the jeopardy skill and play daily. No problems there. Once in a while I listen to the news or radio stations and it is pretty good at that, but again, switching stations may work the first time you ask or it may not. Very frustrating to have to keep barking &#34;play NPR&#34; and then it just continues playing 80s playlist. I would not recommend this to someone who would use it mostly for music. ",

I saw the Echo Dot as a low-cost entry point where I could salvage a good sounding compact speaker system AND dip my toe into home automation without spending a fortune. Next year? Who knows, but for right now the Echo Dot was exactly what I was looking for. ",
Juan,"March 21, 2017 ",3.0,"I have multiple conditions. Because of them me am nonverbal and not able to type. I use a eyegaze device or sometimes a switch. But it's stil hard. With all the devices you can talk to now it can really help me because I can program a button on my aac to speak the entire phrase. However Siri and google and Cortana all have problems understanding my 'voice' and there's not much I can do to change it. After seeing a YouTube video of someone else using the Tobii Dynavox I 15+ (AAC device) with the Echo I decided to test it myself. First I got the Alexa app to see what she can do and tried the swift for Alexa app to see if it understood me. After a great success I got the dot. It's really helped me. Not only can she do important stuff like help with ordering and looking stuff up and controlling smart stuff, she's like a friend to me. Her skills have things like storytelling and even games. I spend a lot of time stuck on my bed alone unable to move more than a finger if that but fully awake. Between the new eyegaze device and the echo dot I'm able to have more fulfilling life. ",
jford40,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"I really want to like the Dot. I got it on Black Friday so at the price I couldn't resist. I did not get it to control smart switches or the temperature or anything like that. I got it mostly because my parents have the original Echo and this seems like the same thing in a smaller form. A few of my opinions and reactions to other reviews:    - I am not sure why there are so many complaints about the speaker volume in this?? I have it in my living room and no matter where I am in the room I can hear Alexa just fine. In fact, most times I don't have the volume set above level 5. I don't know what others are doing that they say it is hard to hear, but for me I have zero issue with that!!    - I knew it was small, but this thing is like the size of a coaster. I find that to be a plus because it can go basically anywhere and not even be seen if you prefer.    - Set up and syncing with Wi-Fi was incredibly simple and I have had no issue since then.    - I am slightly disappointed at what appears to be limitations on the Dot's vocabulary or word recognition. Alexa far too often confuses what I say, or is unable to provide answers to questions that should be easy to answer    - The Alexa skills through the Alexa app are nice ways to add capabilities to your Dot, but I don't like how you then have to remember a different phrase for each individual skill you have enabled. I wish that enabling a skill became part of the Dot's natural interaction instead of having to identify it by stating the skill you want it to do.    - Alexa is very useful in many ways. She is very good at math which my daughter found out doing her homework one day. Being able to call for an Uber or look things up on Wikipedia is fantastic. Getting the daily news in the morning, playing some Jeopardy, hearing the weather, or setting an alarm is great as well. I really like adding things to my to-do list. What is interesting is that Alexa's vocabulary does not seem stifled for this task as she will add verbatim whatever you say.    - Alexa only Prime deals is another added benefit, although I have yet to actually find a deal I want to take advantage of I know that there have been some in the past that were truly great deals and only available with an Alexa enabled device.    The final thing I will say is that I am glad that there is the ability to change the &#34;wake word&#34; from Alexa. For a few days I could not understand why it seemed like Alexa was talking when I would speak to my daughter. It finally dawned on me that when I would say my daughter's name, Alyssa, sometimes Alexa would interpret that as me saying Alexa!! She would also respond at times if the TV commercial for the Dot came on so just an fyi that her hearing can be sensitive!! Overall I think this is a fun gadget to have. I hope that it will continue to evolve in it's capabilities and that eventually it will do many more things without having to search for a specific skill to add to enable it to do things. ",
"Anthony E Forney","March 31, 2017 ",4.0,"Not what I expected. This is not &#34;OK GOOGLE.&#34; Googles app on my phone gets me an answer of some sort 100% of the time. Echo seems to have a limited number of key words it can recognize and respond to. About 85% of the questions I ask come bask with &#34;Sorry, I don't understand what you are asking&#34; or some similar response. It gives you the time, date, and weather well. It will set an alarm, but I have yet to discover how to tell it to use anything specific for that alarm. The one they have as a default is very quite, and is like a light tome of some sort. It has never gotten  my attention, even when I was siting 5 feet from it. It will tell you jokes if you ask it. It will recite pi to hundreds of thousands of digits (I tried it) and may go beyond that. If you get tired of her you can just say :&#34;stop.&#34;  At this point I could say it's a nice toy. I do not have any wifi enabled doors or locks and such in my house, so I wasn't able to try that. It is very good at finding and playing music as well.    Over all it is a nice, well built little device. I'd rather have this &#34;Dot&#34; than the full scale one as this I have attach and use my own speakers, which I like and done have the added cost of the added feature.I hope in the future they will make their system more intelligent to be able to answer any question asked. It needs some type of web crawler to gather and organize data that it can then compare against your question, and at lest make an attempt to answer it instead or no answer at all. ",
Kainesmith.ky,"January 9, 2017 ",4.0,"I really like the echo dot so far. It has a few issues though which I will outline below.    She tends to speak when not spoken to.  I am a 30 year old male that lives alone and it makes me jump every time but because I'm a big brave man I fight through the fear. Jokes aside though, if it were an older person who lives alone I could really see that being a problem. I'll be sitting watching tv and she will ask me to repeat my question or state a random answer to a question that I did not ask, maybe she picks up the tv I'm not sure.  If there is any other noise what so ever she doesn't pick up the wake up word, so be prepared to mute the tv, tell everyone to be quiet and then say Alexa, or in my case echo. I have had to say echo releatedly a few times.    Some good about it is the surprisingly good sound of the speaker when it's playing music. It is much better than I expected after reading some of the reviews.  I like the &#34;to do list&#34; and &#34;shopping list&#34; feature which I add to the lists in the app for more clarity then have her read them back to me every morning. I also like asking for world news every morning when I first get up.  It looks neat also and over all for the price I think it is worth it even if it only played music upon command from across the room. I can see myself using her for that the most. ",
NurseMeg,"April 1, 2017 ",3.0,"I originally bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts and didn't buy one for myself.  BIG MISTAKE!  I gave the first one to my father-in-law and I liked it so much that I opened one of the other presents and kept it to use with my home automation. Don't worry, it wasn't easy around Christmas time, but I did get one of these to replace the one I lifted from the expected receiver.  I then decided to get another one as a gift for my father.  I gave each of my fathers a wemo accessory to get them started in the home automation. I put mine in the kitchen to make use of the grocery list, play music while cooking dinner, and get weather/traffic while I am getting things ready to head out the door for work.  We used this a lot around Christmas time to play Christmas music. I synced this with 2 Nest thermostats and 3 Wemo light switches on exterior lighting of my house.  I can tell Alexa to turn on/off my outside lights and they all turn on/off or I can individually turn them on/off by their location (turn on/off front porch light).  I can tell Alexa to adjust the temperature of my downstairs, upstairs, or both thermostats to a given temperature. It would be nice to ask Alexa what the temperature of the upstairs/downstairs is and receive a temperature read back.  All in all I am enjoying it for my needs and recommend it! I believe it will only get better with time and addition of new devices.    I did have one odd thing happen with the Echo Dot recently.  This past week a song randomly started playing. I didn't say &#34;alexa&#34; or ask for anything to be played and it started playing when no one was in our kitchen area. Does have me worried a bit and wondering how it started playing the music. ",
Bradley,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I have owned my dots for about 6 months now, and there is only good things to say! If you're​ a die-hard Amzon user, then you must buy this product and welcome Alexa into your home! In these past 6 months, Alexa's voice recognition has greatly improved! Using machine learning allows Alexa to improve her voice recognition skills daily. The more people talk to Alexa, the more she learns and improves.    If you are a Prime member and/or a Amazon Unlimited member, you can ask her to play almost any song you can think of! If you want to hear a certain album, then ask her. Or if you want a radio station, the music will not end! Or if you want a certain genre of music, just ask!    Alexa becomes a part of the family. If you want the news read, she will. If you're​ celebrating a birthday, ask Alexa to sing &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; and she will happily; it's beautiful too! From playing music, to singing, to answering questions and playing games, Alexa will fit into your home! If you start off with one dot, you'll probably be buying more later on. One tip to improve voice recognition is to go-to the settings in the Alexa app, and do a voice training on each Echo you have. This greatly enhanced my experience. I have heard Amazon is working on a feature that will give Alexa the ability to recognize the voice that is speaking. That means no more switching profiles, as she knows it's you. This will also allow her to filter out other people taking, so you will no longer have to ask people to quiet down before taking to her! ",
"Andrew J. Good","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have 2 Echo Dots and a Echo.  The echo makes a great music device, the echo dot is a nice extension for my smart home and is still great for stuff like getting my news in the morning.  Alone I would say an echo is a great device, with several smart home devices it's even better.  With 3 echos around my house sometimes two will pick up the wake word at the same time.  This has caused issues and I would rather not change the wake word as it could confuse others in the house.  With that said it's normally minor and not a big deal.    How much my echo dots do could be best summarized with my normal day:    Wake up in the morning/afternoon because of my work schedule I keep my room quite devoid of sunlight.  &#34;Alexa turn on bedroom&#34; Without getting to bed or having an annoying bedside light my room's light turns on thanks to a hue bridge/light bulb and Alexa being able to control hue lights.  &#34;Alexa what's the news&#34; and now I get my customizable flash briefing while I'm getting out of bed.  Walk out of the room saying &#34;Alexa turn off bedroom&#34; no need for a poorly positioned light switch to flick off.    While I'm making food &#34;Alexa, play my main playlist&#34; and I can listen to music without having to worry about turning on a device.  As the food gets done &#34;Alexa, turn on TV&#34; and &#34;Alexa, stop&#34; music turns off and my harmony hub turns on my TV.  By the time I get there it's ready for me to use and I can play TV.  Getting ready for work while watching TV, ready to leave don't want to grab the remote &#34;Alexa, turn off TV&#34; done.  Get home it's all dark &#34;Alexa, turn on living room&#34;.    There are a lot of badly positioned light switches in the house, needing less remotes and in some cases Harmony/Alexa being able to do things quicker is always a good thing.  I have 3 different areas in my room where I might switch and carrying at any time 2-3 remotes around is a pain.  Being able to play music on voice command is great along with being able to turn it off.  Alexa can also be used remotely with my fire tablet and my Fire TV also supports Alexa.  Alexa can also tell jokes and do other things that can also make it a great thing for friends to try to do.  I can even ask Alexa for the movie list of my local theater and ask her about a given movie for more information.  All without having to get up and check my computer or my phone/tablet.    It's not all great though, She makes mistakes, she can't hear to well over loud music including her own and multiple people talking in the background causes mistakes to happen.  Once in a while she'll even respond to the TV randomly even when the TV doesn't say Alexa.  The most annoying thing about echo is that without a Wifi connection it can do almost nothing. ",
"H. Salsano","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"This was our first Echo Dot, and we love her.  Although, not sure she always loves us, as sometimes she doesn't even answer us.  She seems to have a hearing deficiency.  We do have to speak loud and clear for her to even hear us, and especially if we want her to actually understand us.  The problem is mostly when she is playing music or the TV is on.  Of course, she can hear everyone on the TV just fine and respond to all the Alexa commercials.  Good think I have the purchasing PIN set up so only I can order things!  I like listening to the news feeds from Cnet, NPR and the weather.  I like controlling the TV, AV system and lights through her.  I add items to the Our Groceries android app through her, and she usually gets it right.  I use the timer and alarm functions often, especially when my 2 other kitchen timers are already running for other things.  I can tell her to &#34;Turn on Amazon Music&#34; which turns on the stereo and selects Aux, turns on the Amazon Basics Bluetooth receiver, and then I tell her what to play and it comes through the stereo.  I can even listen to kindle books and such this way for more volume.  Love the pause and resume, in case the phone rings.  For music, I tell her to Skip this song when something awful come on .  As time goes on, I find more useful things.  I am now looking at a new skill to alert friends if there is an emergency, called Ask My Buddy, which sounds useful for when one of us is home alone and something happens. ",
"Gadgit Tech","April 24, 2017 ",5.0,"First thoughts, Echo Dot was easy to setup with either a smart phone or computer.  I switched to the computer as it was just easier on the eyes.  Good voice control once you get the hang of it and the method used for commands.    Echo Dot is small and easy to place in a location where one unit can cover a large area.  Integration with a current home automation system was simple using the skills already available and well document between both Amazon and my HA system (in my case HomeSeer).    Con's so far: NO 24 hour clock? I hate having to say, hear or read AM and PM, and the Echo Dot does not support this yet!    I got this to use with my current home automation system due to other devices (hardware failures) having an issues!  I impressed by the simple commands (VR) that allow me to be hands free to operate my lights and systems and the other Echo functions are a plus such as checking news, traffic and playing my own library of music.    The Echo has so many skills sets already available that it will take some time before I discover what all it can do besides what I have already tried, but for 50 dollars I can see using the Echo Dot rather than replace or install other HA devices that need to be replaced or installed due manufacture defect and or failure in my system, I can save on deployment and cost of those devices as well. So I might end up with some HA spares, which is always a good thing.    Note: If you happen to use HomeSeer HA you will need version HS3, HSTouch-with account and also make certain HS3 setup under the network page - remote control settings is CHECKED for JSOM. It took me a bit to figure out that this needed to be checked for remote access for this to work.    Not related to the Echo -  HS3 Running on Lenovo M73 Tiny with Win7 Pro  45 Insteon, 78 Events, 157 Devices  PLM module via Insteon  Plugins: Insteon 3.0.6.0, HSTouch 3.0.0.68, UltraMon3, weatherXML  HSTouch Clients: 3 Androids ",
GLS,"March 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Well I was really pissed at Amazon because they dropped the ball on hitting their two day Prime delivery (because they've gone to “shipping partners” who don't care). I'd ordered this Echo Dot for a friend who can't see, and wanted to help him manage his Pandora music using voice commands. It arrived this afternoon, I hooked it up to my own Pandora account and I'm thunderstruck. What an absolutely beautiful integration of speech input and a great adaptive online music app. As I write this I'm listening to a Pandora station I defined a couple of years ago, “Chigago Radio” named for that great group, Chicago. The music is streaming through the little speaker built into the Dot (it really isn't all that bad in terms of fidelity, though for regular listening I'll normally patch it into my hi-fi system) and as I write and let my station wash over me, I occasionally pause and say “Alexa, thumbs up” or “Alexa, thumbs down” to steer Pandora's adaptive programming in the right direction. She responds “sure...rating saved”. What's amazing is that I know I haven't provided this much input since I created the station two years ago as I have over the past twenty minutes. This has been totally effortless, as the Alexa and Pandora apps are joined at the hip online – I don't even know where my smart TV or Roku remotes are at the moment, I just speak and it happens. Wow! I can't even imagine how my blind friend (a former musician) is going to feel about being able to do this. I just ordered a Dot for myself, because it's that cool. Amazon, you are totally forgiven for the late delivery; you've hit a grand slam with this device! And Alexa, I would love to speak to you privately. You have won my heart, honey ;-) Whew.... ",
Kathy,"December 8, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought an Echo last week and loved it so much that I had to have a Dot for our bedroom.  The first thing that impressed me was the quality of the sound. I had planned on using an external speaker with it, but there is no need for it at all. I'm able to have the sounds nice and low when I'm listening in bed and can turn it up and hear it all the way in my bathroom which is approx. 16 feet away.  The sound is great.  It's not the rich sound that is with the Echo, but it's definitely very good. I used the same app that I had downloaded when I set up my Echo to set up my Dot and it couldn't have been easier. I just plugged it in, connected it to our wifi and then continued with the set up on my app. I'm sure it took less than 5 minutes.    As with the Echo, my favorite things to use the Dot for are listening to music and having it read my Kindle books to me.  I love Audible, but don't always purchase audio books, so it's so nice to just say &#34;Alexa read (whichever book I'm reading)&#34; After I tell it to read my book, I say &#34;set sleep timer for 15 minutes&#34; and it will shut right off. Last night I had trouble falling asleep and I asked it to play music to help me sleep and I heard a selection of relaxing nature sounds.  Then, in the morning I can have it turn on an AM station I like, so I can listen to that while I'm getting ready for the day. I know I can do all of these things on my cell phone, but it's so nice to just be in the middle of whatever I'm doing and just say outloud what I want to hear without having to pick something up.    I'm sure I'll find other uses that I like for the Dot, but for now I'm just thrilled to have it read to me or play music. And I can't emphasize enough how good the sound quality is. If you are thinking about buying a speaker to go with it, I'd wait to get it home and make sure you really need one. Unless you are using this in a very big room, chances are you won't. ",
"🌈 KT","April 10, 2017 ",5.0,"We're still getting used to it, of course, but I'll start with our initial experience.    &#62; It was easy to hook up, which is always a plus.  &#62; It doesn't integrate with the Amazon site as much as I had hoped.  For example, I can't ask Alexa to tell me what was in my last online order.  I'm pretty forgetful so that's one thing I was looking for. (part of why I took a star off)  &#62; The Alexa special deals is pretty awkward.  There are many, but she'll only list 2 at a time, then tells me to go online.  Granted, I would not want to sit there listening to the long hand version of each item (She doesn't just say the item, but a description plus price plus discount and then asks after each one if you want to order it), but I would like a way to customize how she presents the list to me, and then I'd also rather not be told to go online and see the rest.  I'd have looked there already if I wanted to do that. (Another part of why I took a star off)  &#62; She's not as smart as I'd hoped, either.  I have to learn how she wants to hear things, instead of her learning how I phrase things.  As in, I have to know her keywords to get her to tell me anything. (Another part to the -1 star)  &#62; My husband's a writer so I put one in the bedroom for when he wakes up with an idea.  It's been very useful for him to just tell Alexa to make a note - no lights on, no concentrating on what you're writing, no great interruption to my sleep.  &#62; It also functions as an alarm clock (you can pick from various tones through the phone app - why can't you ask Alexa to demo them for you??).  I hooked the Dot up to a bluetooth speaker for the purpose (you can also set the alarm volume (thru the app) which will be different than the normal volume you keep it at for speaking). This is good because we don't have set times to get up, so I'm constantly forgetting to set the alarm before I collapse in bed.  &#62; The special Alexa deals are sometimes quite useful.  I've gotten a couple of toys for my twin niece/nephew, and caught a nice sale on an APC battery backup.    I'm good about updating if anything comes up, but I'll certainly update as we learn and grow with it, too.  Any questions, feel free to comment or email and I'll try to help. ",
Ms1,"November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I would just like to say that this toy started off being remarkable. Linked with my smart home devices and unlimited music this truly was the ultimate (blow your friends away) party trick.  An item of convenience, and much of a necessity in today's busy world.    Then it surely became half effective....     The problem with these devices  is they lack any sort of self improvemet. Instead it seems technology takes the &#34;I'm outdated, please replace me!&#34; approach.  That's the real problem with tech these days, it all needs to be physically replaced.  It has a Shelf life, like something you'd put in your fridge . Manufacturers shudder with excitement being about to build items with a short life span.  When instead we are ready for self awareness from our tech. Technology and software that is able to maintain its self.  Bring forth the new age. Because, humans are not the only future.... ",
W.,"December 12, 2016 ",4.0,"I love this. It is small and easy to use. I love the easter eggs like the star trek prases and results.    It is very customizable to your needs by enabling the available skills on the app. I can use it to order pizza, ask about the weather and traffic, ask it to brief me on the latest news, and it has games like choose your own adventure. I dont think I will be using it to buy anything. Also I do not have smart home items like the phillips hue lights but will probably get some. I like the idea that I can tell it to contol the electronics in the house.    I dont have bluetooth speakers but it still was able to hook up to my old logitech speaker system with a cable. I plan on eventually comnecting it to my fire stick to control the TV.    It is discreet and functions well. The only downside is for reminders it will only add to a to do list or tell you what you already have on your google calendar. If you want it to tell you agendas on other calendars, you have to import them to your google calendar as it will only use a google calendar. Also alarms can only be set within 24 hours.    For the price it is great. It is in my opinion better than the original echo as it is more versatile. It seems to be the gift of the season as most of my family members, including myself, gave them as gifts.    It is fun to bond with others who have them. For example, my dad also got one and is a huge star trek fan. I told him about the star trek easter eggs and he loved that alexa calls him the captain when he asks it to go to warp speed. ",

Gary,"December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"I can't believe I ever lived without these.  I put one in my Media Room and one in my Master Bath.  In addition to the incredible music access, and all the instant information access, the Echo Dot links both to my Samsung SmartThings and Logitech Harmony Ultimate systems.  So using Alexa, I can control my lights, my ceiling fans, and my entire media center.  Relative to music access, I have found that the free access Amazon music didn't include some of the music I liked.  So I upgraded to the Amazon Unlimited Music service for just one Echo Dot ($3.99/month).  If you want that access on multiple Echo Dots, the Unlimited Music service is $7.99/month. One limitation I have noticed: bluetooth connectivity is problematic.  The Echo Dot will nicely be playing music through my a/v receiver's bluetooth, and will suddenly lose the connection.  In addition, every time you use the Echo, you have to tell the Echo to connect to bluetooth.  I am able to connect both my Dots to my a/v receiver, and my stand-alone  bathroom speaker using a 3.5mm - RCA plug and a 3.5mm - 3.5mm cable respectively.  The hard-wire connection is a lot more reliable. The Echo Dot's internal speaker is fine for non-music use, but is pretty limited for music.  With only two limitations, I can't think of a better electronic toy!  Buy it, you'll love it! ",

I think you can connect the Dot to better speakers, I just have not learned how. I use the Dot in my bedroom, and the big Echo in my living room. The big Echo has fantastic speakers and I don't need to turn the volume up very high.  Buy this Dot to save money, or buy the Echo for great speakers...both work the same. ",

First I got the Alexa app to see what she can do and tried the swift for Alexa app to see if it understood me. After a great success I got the dot. It's really helped me. Not only can she do important stuff like help with ordering and looking stuff up and controlling smart stuff, she's like a friend to me. Her skills have things like storytelling and even games. I spend a lot of time stuck on my bed alone unable to move more than a finger if that but fully awake. Between the new eyegaze device and the echo dot I'm able to have more fulfilling life. ",
Ms1,"January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"I would just like to say that this toy started off being remarkable. Linked with my smart home devices and unlimited music this truly was the ultimate (blow your friends away) party trick.  An item of convenience, and much of a necessity in today's busy world.    Then it surely became half effective....     The problem with these devices  is they lack any sort of self improvemet. Instead it seems technology takes the &#34;I'm outdated, please replace me!&#34; approach.  That's the real problem with tech these days, it all needs to be physically replaced.  It has a Shelf life, like something you'd put in your fridge . Manufacturers shudder with excitement being about to build items with a short life span.  When instead we are ready for self awareness from our tech. Technology and software that is able to maintain its self.  Bring forth the new age. Because, humans are not the only future.... ",
Kathy,"March 31, 2017 ",4.0,"I bought an Echo last week and loved it so much that I had to have a Dot for our bedroom.  The first thing that impressed me was the quality of the sound. I had planned on using an external speaker with it, but there is no need for it at all. I'm able to have the sounds nice and low when I'm listening in bed and can turn it up and hear it all the way in my bathroom which is approx. 16 feet away.  The sound is great.  It's not the rich sound that is with the Echo, but it's definitely very good. I used the same app that I had downloaded when I set up my Echo to set up my Dot and it couldn't have been easier. I just plugged it in, connected it to our wifi and then continued with the set up on my app. I'm sure it took less than 5 minutes.    As with the Echo, my favorite things to use the Dot for are listening to music and having it read my Kindle books to me.  I love Audible, but don't always purchase audio books, so it's so nice to just say &#34;Alexa read (whichever book I'm reading)&#34; After I tell it to read my book, I say &#34;set sleep timer for 15 minutes&#34; and it will shut right off. Last night I had trouble falling asleep and I asked it to play music to help me sleep and I heard a selection of relaxing nature sounds.  Then, in the morning I can have it turn on an AM station I like, so I can listen to that while I'm getting ready for the day. I know I can do all of these things on my cell phone, but it's so nice to just be in the middle of whatever I'm doing and just say outloud what I want to hear without having to pick something up.    I'm sure I'll find other uses that I like for the Dot, but for now I'm just thrilled to have it read to me or play music. And I can't emphasize enough how good the sound quality is. If you are thinking about buying a speaker to go with it, I'd wait to get it home and make sure you really need one. Unless you are using this in a very big room, chances are you won't. ",
"🌈 KT","November 10, 2016 ",2.0,"We're still getting used to it, of course, but I'll start with our initial experience.    &#62; It was easy to hook up, which is always a plus.  &#62; It doesn't integrate with the Amazon site as much as I had hoped.  For example, I can't ask Alexa to tell me what was in my last online order.  I'm pretty forgetful so that's one thing I was looking for. (part of why I took a star off)  &#62; The Alexa special deals is pretty awkward.  There are many, but she'll only list 2 at a time, then tells me to go online.  Granted, I would not want to sit there listening to the long hand version of each item (She doesn't just say the item, but a description plus price plus discount and then asks after each one if you want to order it), but I would like a way to customize how she presents the list to me, and then I'd also rather not be told to go online and see the rest.  I'd have looked there already if I wanted to do that. (Another part of why I took a star off)  &#62; She's not as smart as I'd hoped, either.  I have to learn how she wants to hear things, instead of her learning how I phrase things.  As in, I have to know her keywords to get her to tell me anything. (Another part to the -1 star)  &#62; My husband's a writer so I put one in the bedroom for when he wakes up with an idea.  It's been very useful for him to just tell Alexa to make a note - no lights on, no concentrating on what you're writing, no great interruption to my sleep.  &#62; It also functions as an alarm clock (you can pick from various tones through the phone app - why can't you ask Alexa to demo them for you??).  I hooked the Dot up to a bluetooth speaker for the purpose (you can also set the alarm volume (thru the app) which will be different than the normal volume you keep it at for speaking). This is good because we don't have set times to get up, so I'm constantly forgetting to set the alarm before I collapse in bed.  &#62; The special Alexa deals are sometimes quite useful.  I've gotten a couple of toys for my twin niece/nephew, and caught a nice sale on an APC battery backup.    I'm good about updating if anything comes up, but I'll certainly update as we learn and grow with it, too.  Any questions, feel free to comment or email and I'll try to help. ",
"Amazon Customer","November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought two Echo Dots hoping they would work with all my smart-technology.  I have a Wink Hub, Phillips Hue light bulbs and hub, smart plugs, UEboom wireless speaker and Nest thermostat.  You do not need an Echo (the really expensive tall one with the nice speaker in it) to operate your smart-technology using Alexa.  The Echo Dots can do all the same things.  It's awesome being able to have Alexa turn on/off lights, thermostat, connect to wireless speaker, etc.  It's LEGIT!    One thing to keep in mind: when one echo dot connects to a Bluetooth item such as UEboom and then later you are talking to the 2nd echo dot, Alexa will not be able to pair to the UEboom until you ask the first Echo Dot to disconnect from your speaker.  We thought something was wrong and then realized that only one Echo Dot and be paired with a Bluetooth item at a time. ",

JMDK,"April 12, 2017 ",5.0,"The Good:    The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of &#34;Alexa&#34;, &#34;Amazon&#34; or &#34;Echo&#34;).    The Bad:    The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.    Overall:    We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature. ",

I know of a service my friends use that does not work with Echo if  you use that service you may want to check out the Google Home speaker.

I got the [[ASIN:B013GBRR32 Philips BT6000R/37 Splash-Proof Wireless Portable Speaker (Red)&nbsp;from Amazon and the Dot sounds much better and the speaker is splash proof which a more durable choice for a kid.

"Code name April","April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"My husband bought this in November & it's connected to my Amazon prime account. So I've been doing Subscribe & Save for years now through Amazon. And when I started to get emails about what Alexa could do, I was informed I could reorder items through Alexa. What a joke! I have tried it numerous times to get her to reorder items but she says all the time that she can't find the items & has to put it to my shopping list. I tell her that it is on my Subscribe & Save & she still can't find it. As far as I can tell, she's really only good for playing music & telling me the weather. My kids ask her questions all the time & she can't give them good answers. The weird thing is she will start talking while we're having a meal. We don't say her name (which is the wake word) but she responds. Like another reviewer said, for a smart device, she isn't very smart. ",
"A Reader","April 25, 2017 ",4.0,"I bought two dots to serve as devices that could easily play music and news etc. without having to plug my phone into a speaker.  They work OK in this respect; I have them linked up to spotify, and they manage that fine, although I find that 50% of the time I need to go and use the Spotify app, because my voice commands aren't understood right (Alexa is often unwilling to play a Spotify playlist, for example; and she seems unable to understand a request like &#34;play the new album by ___&#34;  But a couple of serious problems.  First, one major feature I want is the ability to play podcasts.  This seems obvious, right?  In theory, Alexa supports this via TuneIn.  But I've gotten it to work only a handful of times.  You should be able to say &#34;play the program ___&#34;.  Often Alexa will identify what I want to hear, tell me she is getting the latest episode--and then nothing happens.  Very frustrating.  The other thing I find annoying is the way bluetooth is implemented.  I started connecting my phone via Bluetooth to play podcasts.  But then whenever I entered the room, I got a very annoying and loud message from Alexa about how she was connected to my phone.  Extremely annoying.  These are basic features; I don't want anything fancy.  I just want this device to be able to play podcasts and to be usable as a not-annoying bluetooth device. ",
"Art Harrington","April 3, 2017 ",3.0,"What can I say about the Echo Dot 2nd gen that you don't all ready know? I have 2 of these and love them. I have one in the kitchen and one in the garage. The one in the kitchen is connected to a external speaker. I have had this Sharper Image speaker for about 4 years and have hardly used it as it was a bday gift from my brother but when I decided to hook an external speaker to my Dot I totally didn't immediately think to use this speaker and now I use it everyday! Even though it is bluetooth i use the audio cable The sound is great when connected to my Sharper Image podium speaker. I don't have an external speaker connected to my garage Echo Dot as of yet but need to because the sound from the Dot is not efficient at all or loud. I have a Echo in my bedroom and the speaker is way more powerful than the Dot and even though you can't use an external speaker with the Echo, I don't think I would anyway. I also use my Amazon Echo and Dot's to control my lights. Setting up Echo Dot was easy and simple even a grandma with no tech skills can do it if you simple follow the directions on the Amazon Alexa app. Have Fun! ",
"P. Bruderer","January 17, 2017 ",2.0,"Really impressed with this.  When I got my first iPhone 4s with Siri, I was pretty disappointed in her limited capabilities, and the speech recognition was not that great.  I had the opposite reaction with Alexa.  Her speech recognition is excellent, even from someone who has english as a 2nd language, or talking to Alexa from an adjacent room, or with a lot of background noise.  I don't think I've ever had her misunderstand my command.    The functionality of Alexa with all my WINK smart home devices is great.  Controlling everything through voice is very handy and fast with Alexa.  Another thing I didn't anticipate is how much I prefer playing music on Alexa over using my phone.  With Alexa when I want to play a different song or skip to the next song on my playlist or Pandora station, I just tell her to do it, I don't have to press any buttons.  Very handy when you're busy working on a task.    Alexa met and exceeded all my expectations.  There's a few quirks on what she can control within whatever smarthome hub you're using, but a quick google search resolved all the issues I encountered. ",
SEvans,"April 21, 2017 ",5.0,"I got the echo dot 2nd Generation for myself for Christmas. Hubby kept saying no they has a bad reputation for not working. But I am an electronic nut and love amazon's  ideas when it comes to this kind of thing. So out of the box it is an adapter and the plug of course as well as the dot. Mind you I was thinking about the bigger Echo, but I know I made the right choice as I wanted something smaller that would not have a chance of being knocked over by my dogs. Well for the past few days I have been trying out different apps regardless of their rating to see what we can do together. I am very impressed Echo hears what I say and does it instantly. I have listened to music and had her read to me from my kindle books list. I am on my way to having my life so much easier as I am now looking at doing a smart home set up and getting a second one to just keep in the kitchen for the todo list and grocery lists, weather reports and everything else I can think of. While the other stays at bedside for sleep music, reading and some meditations as well as an alarm. I have yet to get the hubby to talk to echo to add groceries to the list but he will in time as he sees everything that it can do. I was able to set up my calendar right from the start. I do hope that they soon ad a reminder that I can just ask what I need to know or reminders for my husband. ",
"Michele S.","March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"It's very frustrating at times. For example, its awesome to be able to tell Alexa to set your alarm for 6 am. Some days you can tell it &#34;Alexa off&#34; to stop the alarm. Other days, you are screaming your lungs out and Alexa won't turn off no matter what you do, so you yank the thing out of the wall.  Hence, frustrating. It doesn't seem to understand as much as &#34;ok google&#34; on my phone. Alexa frequently says she doesn't understand. I hate also that it tries to get you to buy things--like extra music. No thanks. I also hated the fact that I bought it on &#34;special&#34; only to find that one week later it was on sale even cheaper.  But to send it back and re-purchase it would have cost nearly as much as the sale, so that sucked.  I think if it could do more, and understand more, I'd be happier with it. ",

I never in my lifetime ever thought that technology would arrive and be affordable. Well the ECHO is flat out an awesome product. I got the first one as a gift and purchased a second along with smart plugs and plan on buying more related items to add on. It is just wonderful and while new it is not only functional and usable it gets better. Since its cloud based you dont have to worry about technology getting more advanced and making this out dated it just keeps getting better with more features. the way i see it eventually it will be in every room of my house. I have two wifi routers and it will control devices on the other network. It is just so much more than i expected. If your an Amazon prime user you will not regret buying this but make sure you know what you are getting yourself into. This is just the starter product which is great by itself. You may need bluetooth speakers for large rooms smart switches and lights smart hubs etc... to complete your home so if you are willing to take that plunge understand it will get expensive as you will want to do it.

"L. Sackman","March 17, 2017 ",3.0,"My teen wanted this for Christmas so I bought two, one of each of us.  I'm glad I did.  I can get corny jokes, interesting facts, a story read to me from my book list (I listen to a chapter or two a night before going to sleep), a wake-up call, a timer, wonderful music to listen to and easy ordering as well as specials.  I am having thermostats which work with Alexa installed and next will be getting the light bulbs for her to turn on.  Slowly but surely our house is turning into a 'smart' house and it all started with Alexa.  My teen loves that it's portable so it can go out side on our patio and play music there.    Why the Echo Dot rather than the Echo?  We pretty much live on two levels so decided two &#34;Dots&#34; would work better than one Echo.  Given that the music choices of my teen and myself as so vastly different, this has worked out well for us.  We might need one more for the lights but until we get them to see if they are in range, I won't know.  I will probably get the third anyway as it will make it easier for background music to be available in the common areas. ",
"Texas Jack","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Great product!  It does everything as advertised and MORE.  I am now able to use Alexa voice commands for my X10 devices simply by adding two free programs called HEYU (to send X10 commands) and HA-bridge (this emulates a Phillips Hue bridge) on an old Raspberry Pi model B.  After installing and setting up these two programs, simply tell Alexa to &#34;Discover Devices&#34;.  Alexa will find everything you configured in the  HA-bridge software.  You can tell Alexa to now turn ON, OFF, or DIM those devices, it communicates to the HA-bridge software which then tells the HEYU program to send the X10 command over the power lines via a X10 CM11A transceiver (or wireless if you have a firecracker device connected to the Raspberry Pi).

"Peter E.","April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I love this!!!  When these first came out I didn't think it would be something I would use much.  At least, not until my whole house has smart appliances.    My wife didn't want me to buy it she couldn't see the use for it.    She became addicted to it the first night. Especially if you sign up for Amazon Prime Music which has a huge selection for about $4 a month.    We've been watching less TV and listening to more music which is wonderful.    I love using the shopping list and to do list feature.    My 2.5 year old loves it and already talks to Alexa. We play kids song mixes they have and he dances away.    The weather and time, calculations and conversions and Wikipedia are really helpful to have around.    It's loud enough for a living room but I do want the full sized one eventually and move this to a bedroom.    The voice recognition is amazingly good too. You don't have to pause for a moment after saying Alexa. Just speak as you would to anyone home. It's really impressive.    You also don't notice it's even there, the design is so good.

Bradley,"January 22, 2017 ",5.0,"I have owned my dots for about 6 months now, and there is only good things to say! If you're​ a die-hard Amzon user, then you must buy this product and welcome Alexa into your home! In these past 6 months, Alexa's voice recognition has greatly improved! Using machine learning allows Alexa to improve her voice recognition skills daily. The more people talk to Alexa, the more she learns and improves.    If you are a Prime member and/or a Amazon Unlimited member, you can ask her to play almost any song you can think of! If you want to hear a certain album, then ask her. Or if you want a radio station, the music will not end! Or if you want a certain genre of music, just ask!    Alexa becomes a part of the family. If you want the news read, she will. If you're​ celebrating a birthday, ask Alexa to sing &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; and she will happily; it's beautiful too! From playing music, to singing, to answering questions and playing games, Alexa will fit into your home! If you start off with one dot, you'll probably be buying more later on. One tip to improve voice recognition is to go-to the settings in the Alexa app, and do a voice training on each Echo you have. This greatly enhanced my experience. I have heard Amazon is working on a feature that will give Alexa the ability to recognize the voice that is speaking. That means no more switching profiles, as she knows it's you. This will also allow her to filter out other people taking, so you will no longer have to ask people to quiet down before taking to her! ",

Be sure to have the Amazon Alexa  App downloaded when you are going to set up the Echo Dot. As I used it to ask questions, it has amazed me. I don't show it in the video, but I asked Alexa to put an item it my shopping cart and sure enough, there in my shopping cart was the item.

"H. Salsano","March 12, 2017 ",5.0,"This was our first Echo Dot, and we love her.  Although, not sure she always loves us, as sometimes she doesn't even answer us.  She seems to have a hearing deficiency.  We do have to speak loud and clear for her to even hear us, and especially if we want her to actually understand us.  The problem is mostly when she is playing music or the TV is on.  Of course, she can hear everyone on the TV just fine and respond to all the Alexa commercials.  Good think I have the purchasing PIN set up so only I can order things!  I like listening to the news feeds from Cnet, NPR and the weather.  I like controlling the TV, AV system and lights through her.  I add items to the Our Groceries android app through her, and she usually gets it right.  I use the timer and alarm functions often, especially when my 2 other kitchen timers are already running for other things.  I can tell her to &#34;Turn on Amazon Music&#34; which turns on the stereo and selects Aux, turns on the Amazon Basics Bluetooth receiver, and then I tell her what to play and it comes through the stereo.  I can even listen to kindle books and such this way for more volume.  Love the pause and resume, in case the phone rings.  For music, I tell her to Skip this song when something awful come on .  As time goes on, I find more useful things.  I am now looking at a new skill to alert friends if there is an emergency, called Ask My Buddy, which sounds useful for when one of us is home alone and something happens. ",
NurseMeg,"March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I originally bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts and didn't buy one for myself.  BIG MISTAKE!  I gave the first one to my father-in-law and I liked it so much that I opened one of the other presents and kept it to use with my home automation. Don't worry, it wasn't easy around Christmas time, but I did get one of these to replace the one I lifted from the expected receiver.  I then decided to get another one as a gift for my father.  I gave each of my fathers a wemo accessory to get them started in the home automation. I put mine in the kitchen to make use of the grocery list, play music while cooking dinner, and get weather/traffic while I am getting things ready to head out the door for work.  We used this a lot around Christmas time to play Christmas music. I synced this with 2 Nest thermostats and 3 Wemo light switches on exterior lighting of my house.  I can tell Alexa to turn on/off my outside lights and they all turn on/off or I can individually turn them on/off by their location (turn on/off front porch light).  I can tell Alexa to adjust the temperature of my downstairs, upstairs, or both thermostats to a given temperature. It would be nice to ask Alexa what the temperature of the upstairs/downstairs is and receive a temperature read back.  All in all I am enjoying it for my needs and recommend it! I believe it will only get better with time and addition of new devices.    I did have one odd thing happen with the Echo Dot recently.  This past week a song randomly started playing. I didn't say &#34;alexa&#34; or ask for anything to be played and it started playing when no one was in our kitchen area. Does have me worried a bit and wondering how it started playing the music. ",

She not only tells the time and weather, etc but I can just tell her what to put in my shopping list both with an app and without.  She reads to me, even just regular kindle books, and if it's possible to overuse the timer then I am sure to find out lol because I use it all the time.  She is loud too.  I thought I'd need a speaker for it but we can hear her just fine from all of our rooms.  Granted we only have 1 level, but we were still very impressed with her volume, and it's not even all the way up. We keep it on 7 or 8 and she's pretty loud. Highly recommend. ",
"Dianna Dougherty","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Received as a gift so can't complain much. It is JUST OK. There are def some bugs and its not very intuitive.  You can only ask it tings that it knows such as to play music or what the weather is. Everything has to be preset in the app. Nothing is automatically learned.  With google you can ask ANYTHING and it will read you the Wikipedia answer.  Not with alexa. Her knowledge is quite minimal.  One major flaw that i found and reported to amazon is this:  If you use a bose Bluetooth speaker with it and are playing a music and tell alexa to stop it will stop the music.  Okay there. Now you can walk away or leave your house and if your speaker has an automatic shut off as soon as the wireless speaker turns off it will begin playing the last song it stopped on trough its internal speaker so i have to tell it to stop again. Why would this be useful?? If i tell alexa to stop playing music and then power off the wireless speaker it starts playing again from built in audio. Immagine waking up in the middle of the night to music playing. Not fun. Needs to be as SMART as google and honestly not sure amazon will ever have that capability. But for 50bucks I guess you get what you pay for. ",
CM,"November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"This is such an awesome product! I saw the full-sized echo at a friend's house and was thoroughly impressed. I got the echo dot (I'm on a student budget) and hooked it up to a nice set of speakers in my apartment and I love the potential this thing has. It's not 100% there yet as far as the software but it is being updated on the regular, so its like buying a piece of technology that keeps getting better. I even bought one for my parents (who have a lot of smart devices in the house, but no central way to control them) as a gift. It works with most of the smart products u probably already have in your home including the nest thermostat/CO monitor etc. NOTICE: the 3.5 mm jack takes a bit more force than normal to &#34;click&#34; in when inserting an audio cable - your product is NOT defective lol. ",
"Roland W.","January 4, 2017 ",2.0,"&nbsp;Ok, the idea of not having to type your questions and getting pretty good and accurate answers (most of the time) is pretty amazing.  Set up was very easy, just download the Alexa App and then follow the step by step WIFI set up instructions. Right now I am only using it for basic requests (see video) and that works well. I will keep adding skills (these are additional little programs you can enable on the amazon.com website Just search &#34;Alexa Skills&#34; in the amazon search bar and it routes you to the menu. You can add sports teams, kids games etc. Alexa can tell you jokes (most of them are pretty funny and all so far are kid friendly).  Speaker quality is ok for such a small device - you can plug in an external speaker directly into the Dot and then you can control it through the Dot. I have a Sonos System (whole house), and I would have to get a separate DOT to plug into the sonos in my media centre, so the Dots can communicate. Have not done that so far. But it is a lot of fun to play around, get weather, movie times, play some background music or meditation songs etc. Just play around with it. I have a &#34;slight&#34; accent and it understands me without a problem.  Just be prepared that kids will yell at this little thing, demanding answers and a play buddy who gives them honest feedback on how their hair looks today :)    Currently I am using it mostly as a toy, but as my house is already rather high tech with everything wireless from thermostate (Lennox, which does not connect to ALEXA yet - per customer service) to security camera, Hue lights in some areas, I am planning on expanding the in house Dot Network over the coming months when manufacturers add more functionalities. I keep you posted.    I went on Amazon Skill website and enabled a ton of skills. Just make sure you write down how to activate them. (play 20 words, the secret door, bed time story etc.... you can have a lot of fun with these. I will get one for my daughters room so she can get &#34;Alexa, play relaxing songs for 15 minutes&#34; at bed time.

Hopels,"December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Replaced the larger Alexa Echo with the Dot 2nd Gen.  Obviously the much smaller size is nice.  I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.    The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.    We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.    Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.  I took off one star because while I have no issues with it, it sometimes doesn't &#34;hear&#34; my wife. ",
Rebecca,"January 19, 2017 ",5.0,"This little guy is fantastic! While I doubt anyone will be using the sheer wealth of functions this can perform (as some are, admitedly, quite lack-luster), the ones that I use it for are done well. Once the shiny veneer of new tech fades off, and you eventually stop asking Echo for jokes and punchlines, you won't be discarding her - which is common with other new innovations. Instead, you will probably use one of the following functions regularly, each of which I recommend getting the echo dot for:    -Setting kitchen timers: You won't think much of it until you try it, then you won't be able to go back. Just saying &#34;Alexa, start a timer for 20 minutes&#34; without jumbling for your phone, while simultaneously closing the oven is revolutionary. This is one of the best features Alexa has.    -Interactive Speaker Assistant: While I doubt audiophiles will be satisfied with Alexa's sound quality, that problem can easily be remedied, since you can just connect your own speakers through the audio jack, and Alexa will speak through them. The sound quality on the Echo Dot's speakers isn't bad, though, if you choose to listen through the dot. Either way, Alexa can search music from Spotify, Amazon Music, and Pandora via vocal commands. You can also set Spotify as your main music streamer (Amazon Music is the default, of course), so you won't have to verbally command Alexa to use Spotify, if that is your choice. It's great to just say a song, and have Alexa play it. ",
JMDK,"October 29, 2016 ",4.0,"The Good:    The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of &#34;Alexa&#34;, &#34;Amazon&#34; or &#34;Echo&#34;).    The Bad:    The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.    Overall:    We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature. ",
"Just me","March 14, 2017 ",5.0,"I am a big amazon fan and I depend on reviews. Let me start by saying I was so excited about this product even though my spouse was saying it will only make me lazy..Lol. I know there are several reviews on this product but here goes...I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen basically for the 2- level of our home; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive bigger one and too good to pass up. The Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the 2 floor!  Day 1 when I received it I was a little worried that I would need to send it back because Alexas first word would not sound; for example I would ask &#34;Alexa what time is it?&#34; and she would say &#34;Is 7:30pm&#34; or I would ask &#34;Tell me a joke&#34; and she would not say the first part of the joke, I asked &#34;how old are you?&#34; and the whole human part would not sound. FYI: you can read the answers on your app as well, that's how I knew I missed that part. The next day I came home and some kind of way she was answering all of the questions. I don't know if she just needed to be full charged or what, but the problem fixed itself.  I am really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. Considering everything, for $49 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to building your smart home, home automation and voice recognition technology. Overall, I would highly recommend this product. ",
SundayAtDusk,"December 30, 2016 ",5.0,"This was a Christmas present for my elder mother. We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device. ",
"The Bon","March 8, 2017 ",4.0,"We had an Echo and thought it was all we needed. We put it in our livingroom (by the kitchen) and I pick random songs to play during the day, but also ask questions whenever I'm watching a movie on TV or listening to a song and wonder if a star or singer is still alive (ask Alexa - Which is the Echo's name).  I put things on my 'shopping list and it goes on my phone automatically (and on my husband's phone too, since we both have the Alexa app on our phones.). Recipes, measurements, and facts about whatever. But it's nowhere near our bedroom, so I ordered an Echo Dot as an 'extension'.  I can't believe we lived without this little, inexpensive, companion. It's on my nightstand and acts as our alarm clock, news station, weather station, and music source that has EVERY KIND OF MUSIC you could possibly want, just for the asking.  We are so blessed to be living in a time where we can have these Amazon innovations at our fingertips. The Echo and Alexa both have replaced our clocks, encyclopedia, dictionary, stereo, cd's, etc. we ordered ours through the &#34;LOVE MY ECHO&#34; website where we also get all information on both. Thank you, Amazon, for a website like this one. ",

"Colleen M Traeger","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Impressed. At first I really enjoyed the Echo Dot. It was fun asking it questions. Then the novelty wore off. In order to have your questions answered you first DL an app then ask it to open something. The apps are strange lengthy names that are hard to remember like &#34;Alexia, open &#34;My  Horoscope to read my daily horoscope&#34; instead of a simple 'what's my horoscope&#34;. There are 10k apps full of interesting and useless things. Why it can't be developed where you DL an app to customize your needs is beyond me.    What's interesting is that you can make your home a smart home and control it remotely or just by speaking what you need.    I've also loved asking it to add things to my to do list as well as add things to my shopping list.    While I do like it, I'm just a little disappointed. I'm hoping that this is similar to when Dot Matrix first came out.    I can without a doubt see the value in this maturing. I'll hang on to it (in 30 years it'll be worth a nice bundle). Regardless of the slight pessimistic review, I do recommend it. ",
"Sassy and Oliver","January 28, 2017 ",5.0,"I have both the Echo, and the Echo Dot. This little Dot works as well as its big sister Echo, only.... the 🔊 speaker is a wimp. However, if you are looking to save a lot on the price difference between the two, this one is the perfect compromise. Just expect poor sound quality. I think you can connect the Dot to better speakers, I just have not learned how. I use the Dot in my bedroom, and the big Echo in my living room. The big Echo has fantastic speakers and I don't need to turn the volume up very high.  Buy this Dot to save money, or buy the Echo for great speakers...both work the same. ",
Dia,"March 6, 2017 ",4.0,"Alexa is a lot of fun. I have added some of her skills but they don't seem to function as expected. She only speaks English, which while I can understand programming another language could've been a huge investment, it's still a disadvantage.    My favorite features are:  `playing music via a paired speaker. That sounds silly, but it's so convenient to just yell &#34;Alexa, play iheart radio&#34; when busy.  `timers. Asking her to set a timer is really convenient  `shopping list. She can add items to your shopping list which you can view on your smartphone when out of the house. For this forget-everything-gal, that feature is really helpful.  `controlling it with the app. My husband still doesn't know how I can turn down the music from the other room - or turn it on. I'll keep it a mystery for as long as I can. It's nice to be able to shut off a timer or change the volume from my phone when I'm on the other side of the house. ",
Jarren,"March 11, 2017 ",4.0,"This is a great item, especially as a developer. My baby cousins also enjoyed this product so much, I bought them one for Christmas. You can ask Alexa for holiday jokes. You can also say, &#34;Alexa, tell me I'm beautiful&#34;.    I use it for an alarm clock, to play music on Spotify, and to hear daily facts. You can also get some exclusive Alexa only deals. As a developer, you can get free hoodies / shirts from developing Alexa Skills and submitting it to the app store.    Beware though, you might get noise complaints from your upstairs neighbor from having this device. I guess this device playing a few songs at volume 7 (out of max 10) playing music at 7 pm can net you a noise complaint. I didn't even know the speakers were that great, but apparently so! :grimacing: ",
"Sid Scheck","March 12, 2017 ",4.0,"&nbsp;It was about 2 weeks ago when I was talking with my friend about their Echo Dot and she showed me a few things. I thought very cool and maybe I should get one. Sure enough, 2 days later I won one at a company event. The Echo Dot is generally easy to set up. Be sure to have the Amazon Alexa  App downloaded when you are going to set up the Echo Dot. As I used it to ask questions, it has amazed me. I don't show it in the video, but I asked Alexa to put an item it my shopping cart and sure enough, there in my shopping cart was the item. I can see I will be using the Alex to listen to different types of music as well. So much you can do with it. Have fun! You will love it! ",
"Amazon Customer","March 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I love the size and the price but the speaker is horrible. I have seen better speakers in smaller things so it's not like it can't be done. I can say that the microphone is really well-made it can pick my voice up 20 feet away in the Next Room  at  moderate levels  without having to yell. Like the Alexa, I wish it was more informative, there are so many questions I asked that Alexa does not know the answer to but Google does. I also wish that a lot of the apps were not third party where you have to ask Alexa to ask the app to do something like my buddy you have to say Alexa ask my buddy to send an alert message to a family member because I have fallen and can't get up it would be nice if you could say Alexa contact my family member and tell them I have fallen and cannot get up. But aside from that I love the direction that it's heading, I just wish it was there already we have the technology to make it happen I can only assume there's red tape involved ",
"Amazon Customer","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I thoughtful Echo was interesting, but wanted to opt with just the Dot and use my own Bluetooth speakers. Unfortunately, Amazon discontinued the first generation just as I was able to order.  When the second generation was announced, I knew I'd get one.  With the $10/ month for 5 month plan for Prime members, it was a no trainer. Although I'm more heavily into Apple's ecosystem, and gave smart appliances (Apple)  they will work with Alexander too.  There is quite a bit of crossover. I'm excited and look forward even using the Dot as an alarm clock, awakening me with my Prime Music. I'm sure it's going to be loads of other fun too. I also have a Kindle Fire HDX, FireStick, etc, and know it will integrate nicely.    I have had it for about a week and it's VERY cool!  Does so much more than even Siri by being able to add skills. Also works great with my iDevices switched simulataneously with iOS HomeKit. This was a great buy! ",
Stephanie,"November 14, 2016 ",3.0,"I like this Alexia dot thingy! Sometimes though she talks to me when I am not talking to her. She thinks she hears her name. She seems kinda needy. She's always there. Listening to my conversations and trying to include herself in them. I have to tell her that I wasn't talking to her and to only talk when she's been spoken to. She doesn't get the hint. Also when she hears her name on the Alexia commercials she responds. Overall I really like this contraption. It's pretty neat. It tells me anything I want to know. She even sang me the alphabet like William Shatner one day. She hasn't done it since. We liked her so much we got another one for upstairs. Alexia even controls our lights. Our house is basically automated. ",
"this is me","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"Absolutely love these. We bought the tall Echo. Got on the list before it came out. Then we bought a dot for our shop, Then we went back and bought the deal that was buy 5 get 1 free. These are amazing. We have one for almost every room. Although, I do not advise that. Reason being is that when you say &#34;Alexa, what is the forecast&#34; and loud enough, &#34;all&#34; of them start giving you the forecast...lol So, we keep them spread out. We also gave a couple to our adult kids for Christmas.    Great for helping to figure out math problems, telling jokes and you can even order amazon items from your echo. There is so much the echo dot can do. They are a must have.    PROS:  the clarity is very good.  the compact size is perfect  you can ask almost anything and he will have the answer    CONS:  my only con is that they sometimes wake up without us even talking.    But, these are highly recommended for sure. ",
Emery,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"so I have had alexa for just over  month and at first I loved it.

Also it stopped syncing with my amazon prime music and pandora stations......now it says I need to be an amazon prime member, but when I check my aet up....it still shows my prime information. What a waste of money. I should have just tried a bigger one and maybe the speakers would have been betted too. horrible when tryibg to listen to the news updates at the dinner table and alexa is only 10 feet away and you cant hear what she is saying over any sound.

"Adam Jerome White","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"If I were to rate this on its potential alone, I would rate it 5 stars.  But there just isn't the functionality now for it to be useful for 5 stars.  It has some really cool features, and I am sure in the future it will have more.  At that point I will come back and adjust my rating to make it a better rating.    For now I will tell you what I can do with it.  One cool feature is just playing music, I have it hooked up to an AMP, and into speakers in my ceiling.  I say &#34;Alexa play XXXX&#34; and the music starts.  It pretty much plays whatever I ask for, I guess it is included in a prime membership, because I am not paying for any additional service.  I have a Wink Hub 2 and Wink Relay, so I can turn on and off lights in the house, including the fireplace, with Alexa.

"Art Harrington","March 9, 2017 ",3.0,"What can I say about the Echo Dot 2nd gen that you don't all ready know? I have 2 of these and love them. I have one in the kitchen and one in the garage. The one in the kitchen is connected to a external speaker. I have had this Sharper Image speaker for about 4 years and have hardly used it as it was a bday gift from my brother but when I decided to hook an external speaker to my Dot I totally didn't immediately think to use this speaker and now I use it everyday! Even though it is bluetooth i use the audio cable The sound is great when connected to my Sharper Image podium speaker. I don't have an external speaker connected to my garage Echo Dot as of yet but need to because the sound from the Dot is not efficient at all or loud. I have a Echo in my bedroom and the speaker is way more powerful than the Dot and even though you can't use an external speaker with the Echo, I don't think I would anyway. I also use my Amazon Echo and Dot's to control my lights. Setting up Echo Dot was easy and simple even a grandma with no tech skills can do it if you simple follow the directions on the Amazon Alexa app. Have Fun! ",
ultra55371d,"December 21, 2016 ",5.0,"I am really liking this device so far.  Ever since the echo came out a couple of years ago, I wanted one, but it was just a little too expensive to experiment with.  With the lower cost of the Dot, the option to use a better speaker system and all the benefits of the full size Echo, this was a easy purchase.    I purchased the kit deal with the Phillips Hue Bridge and lights.  In addition, I purchased another 2 Phillips Hue bulbs and a Wemo smart plug.  the setup and installation of everything was very simple and didn't take long at all.  It is now very convenient to control the lighting in our our room and bathroom now.  The hardest thing to remember is not to use the switches anymore.    Another advantage the Dot has over the Echo is the ability to use a better speaker system.  I hooked ours up to a Logictech Z623 2.1 speaker system and it sounds beyond awesome.  I have both a Prime membership and a Spotify account.  Listening to Spotify now is very enjoyable.    There is a little learning curve on how to speak to the Dot, but we're all getting the hang of it.  I will be adding more Dots and other home automation devices to my home in the near future.  So far this has been a great experience and wonderful product.  I almost purchased the new Google Voice, but very happy I didn't since initial reviews are not that great and it sounds like they released it a bit too soon.  The Echo / Dot program has been around for years, has many partners and the possibilities are almost endless with these devices.  Very happy camper! ",
"P. Bruderer","April 21, 2017 ",5.0,"Really impressed with this.  When I got my first iPhone 4s with Siri, I was pretty disappointed in her limited capabilities, and the speech recognition was not that great.  I had the opposite reaction with Alexa.  Her speech recognition is excellent, even from someone who has english as a 2nd language, or talking to Alexa from an adjacent room, or with a lot of background noise.  I don't think I've ever had her misunderstand my command.    The functionality of Alexa with all my WINK smart home devices is great.  Controlling everything through voice is very handy and fast with Alexa.  Another thing I didn't anticipate is how much I prefer playing music on Alexa over using my phone.  With Alexa when I want to play a different song or skip to the next song on my playlist or Pandora station, I just tell her to do it, I don't have to press any buttons.  Very handy when you're busy working on a task.    Alexa met and exceeded all my expectations.  There's a few quirks on what she can control within whatever smarthome hub you're using, but a quick google search resolved all the issues I encountered. ",
"Amazon Customer","November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"This is the thing you didn't know you needed but soon discover you cant live without!!! Does what it says it will and more! Alexa even has a sense of humor.  You will need to hook it up to a speaker, sound bar, etc for music as it says.  The price is great & affordable enough to put one in every room!  We love having one in the bathroom so while we are taking showers we can get traffic,weather,and news while getting ready for work without having to stop and mess with our phones.  I have one in my workshop because I do a lot of painting & wood work so its been awesome being able to play music, listen to audible and for those that don't have audible Alexa will read your kindle books, it wont be near as good as voice actors tho & she will spell some words out instead of pronouncing  them.  For lite reading like recipes while cooking, etc works great ! Would be nice if there was an app we could get to give Alexa the ability to read like audible, soon I'm sure!  She will access audible though, I just give her the command & its done.  I have Pandora &  she will bring up my custom playlists as well.  She will give traffic reports specific to your personal route to work, once you set up the addresses in the Alexa app.  Which is nice to know while you're getting ready that you have a detour and need to leave a few minutes early without having to sit and wait on the news.

W,"March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"This baby Echo is still learning to walk. I have the big Echo and love it. Sadly, the Echo Dot I bought only worked half of the time.

Commenting on the product when it DID work, it was okay at best. &#34;Alexa&#34; functions are great (as with the big Echo), but the build quality is below my expectations; it looks, feels, and sounds like a cheap, light piece of plastic to me.

"L. Sackman","December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"My teen wanted this for Christmas so I bought two, one of each of us.  I'm glad I did.  I can get corny jokes, interesting facts, a story read to me from my book list (I listen to a chapter or two a night before going to sleep), a wake-up call, a timer, wonderful music to listen to and easy ordering as well as specials.  I am having thermostats which work with Alexa installed and next will be getting the light bulbs for her to turn on.  Slowly but surely our house is turning into a 'smart' house and it all started with Alexa.  My teen loves that it's portable so it can go out side on our patio and play music there.    Why the Echo Dot rather than the Echo?  We pretty much live on two levels so decided two &#34;Dots&#34; would work better than one Echo.  Given that the music choices of my teen and myself as so vastly different, this has worked out well for us.  We might need one more for the lights but until we get them to see if they are in range, I won't know.  I will probably get the third anyway as it will make it easier for background music to be available in the common areas. ",
Matthew,"February 3, 2017 ",2.0,"I have anot echo and a dot. I love them both. The speaker on this is better than advertised, I believe. It's not bad for music but is obviously not as good as the full echo. Alexa is wonderful and the features are very useful. I look forward to there being new skills added, but that depends on 3rd parties more than amazon. It's great in the morning's for some quick news and handling those random thoughts throughout the day. ",
"Just me","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I am a big amazon fan and I depend on reviews. Let me start by saying I was so excited about this product even though my spouse was saying it will only make me lazy..Lol. I know there are several reviews on this product but here goes...I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen basically for the 2- level of our home; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive bigger one and too good to pass up. The Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the 2 floor!  Day 1 when I received it I was a little worried that I would need to send it back because Alexas first word would not sound; for example I would ask &#34;Alexa what time is it?&#34; and she would say &#34;Is 7:30pm&#34; or I would ask &#34;Tell me a joke&#34; and she would not say the first part of the joke, I asked &#34;how old are you?&#34; and the whole human part would not sound. FYI: you can read the answers on your app as well, that's how I knew I missed that part. The next day I came home and some kind of way she was answering all of the questions. I don't know if she just needed to be full charged or what, but the problem fixed itself.  I am really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. Considering everything, for $49 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to building your smart home, home automation and voice recognition technology. Overall, I would highly recommend this product. ",
"Diane J Owen","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Alexa goes in spurts in my house. She's probably lonely, cause I like quiet and I forget about her. But, she's really good at playing music--I hooked her up to my speakers. She's fun to play games with. Amazon sends ideas all the time, like ordering special deals, or music playlist. They enable new skills, like apps, all the time. I like Magic 8 Ball. Ask her if Trump will last four years. Anyway, well worth her small investment. ",
"Fan of His Royal Badness","March 8, 2017 ",4.0,"Got it for one of my kids.  The kid uses this as an alarm clock, to turn lights on and off with the&nbsp;TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works w/ Amazon Alexa & Google Assistant (HS100), we also have it linked to our&nbsp;Nest Learning Thermostat, 3rd Generation, Works with Amazon Alexa]    The kids use it with a streaming music service one of the ones that is popular.  There is information on the services that work with Echo.  I know of a service my friends use that does not work with Echo if  you use that service you may want to check out the Google Home speaker.    The speaker is not great so I would suggest pairing it with a BlueTooth speaker because the sound is not great as a stand alone.  I got the [[ASIN:B013GBRR32 Philips BT6000R/37 Splash-Proof Wireless Portable Speaker (Red)&nbsp;from Amazon and the Dot sounds much better and the speaker is splash proof which a more durable choice for a kid.  Amazon also has colorful&nbsp;Amazon Echo Dot Case (fits Echo Dot 2nd Generation only) - Indigo Fabric&nbsp;to match room decor.    For those concerned about privacy (like a few of my friends) just unplug when you don't want the device to listen in on your conversations or activities.  Great choice, kid friendly, and has a lot of options for automating your home. ",
"Matthew Pence","March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is a bit...special.  I can give the echo dot a command, the command will fail, then I can reissue the same command with the same inflection and no background noise...with success?    The search functionality is limited.  I can't ask a conversational question (&#34;Alexa, why can't I use you to search the internet&#34;).  However, it does function really well as a vocal clock. (&#34;Alexa, time&#34;)    No apparent ability to control colors or scenes on my Philips Hue system.  :-/    The connection to Prime music works well with my home theater.  Alexa is good at finding music that I ask for. ",
Annadolyn,"April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"We had this for approximately a day and a half before starting the return process and buying Google Home instead. Google Home, running on Google (obviously), is so much more robust and functional than Alexa, that runs on Bing (who uses Bing??). Google can answer so many more questions, making it so much more functional/usable. Almost every response Alexa made was &#34;I'm sorry, I don't understand.&#34; I highly recommend Google Home instead. ",
"Carol Johnson","April 13, 2017 ",3.0,"This is wonderful! Alexa is a personal helper who is always eager to answer. She gives me the weather reports, the daily news briefs,  the time, sets alarms and timers, plays games, tells jokes, answers questions, plays music and more! When she plays music, she will tell me the title and artist when I ask. I understand that I can add a speaker to the Dot but I think the sound is great just the way it is. Very good quality! It has volume setting from one to ten. Just ask her to set the number you prefer. Everything is done with your voice. She even turns my bedroom light on and off when I ask. Be sure to say good morning, she will always tell you something! I got this for my blind, elderly mother and it has been a life changing experience for mother. Alexa is her companion. ",
Adrian,"January 10, 2017 ",2.0,"This is a slightly useful device. It's ok for asking web search info items , like weather or scores, and a few other things.  I had a lot of problems connecting to it initially, becuase I use 2-factor authentication on my account and by the time I had gone to my authenticator app and got a code, returned to Alexa app and gone through the login process again, the code expired. I had to turn off 2-factor on my account, and even then it made me do a capcha that was complicated by the fact that the app won't scroll, so I was typing in the capcha field blind. Thanks for the frustration, Alexa. I have secure physical possession of both devices, why can't the process be much easier?  I have a Harmony hub for AV control, and Alexa can use it. Once again, connection problems abound, as the Alexa app insisted that I didn't have a Harmony hub, even though the Harmony app is on the very same phone that Alexa app is on. Eventually I was successful. Then came the sad discovery that all it can do is turn AV gear on and off. There went my dream of tuning my dvr by voice command. More frustration.  So then I linked my Spotify account to have it play thru bluetooth speakers. This works, but every time I return to play music again, I have to manually make spotify use the bluetooth speakers, as it defaults to using the Dot speaker. Haven't found a work-around yet. Thanks for nothing, Alexa.  As far as simple voice commands, it works about 80% of the time. Sometimes it ignores me, sometimes it whines about the internet connection. I live in a rural neighborhood that's not too badly wifi congested. My cell phone stays connected anywhere on my property but Alexa struggles from a 30 foot distance to my wifi router. It randomly announces when it connects to the wifi or bluetooth. It reacts to what it hears on TV sometimes(yes I have done the voice training), which leads to baffling announcements. I say 'Alexa, shut up&#34; a lot.  In summary, this would be a good deal at $19. Too bad it cost $50.  I'll keep it, but it doesn't really do anything my Nexus 6 won't do with the &#34;OK Google&#34; function. Amazon is a major cloud provider, why can't they put a good web app up for connecting and configuring and linking?  I can't recommend this device unless you are a 'smart home' hobbyist who wants to spend money linking it to Zwave or Zigbee devices.  UPDATE: I decided to keep this and use it as a voice commanded search engine for simple questions, but its results have been poor. I will be returning it as being nearly useless to me.  When it failed to answer a question, I repeated the question to Ok Google on my phone, and in all cases it was able to answer. Here are some of those questions:  1. When was the piano invented?  2. Who was Field Marshal von Rundstedt?  3. What is maximum allowed length of a golf club?  I'm not interested in using this as am Amazon shopping tool, which it is probably good at. I'm sending it back. ",
"Kar Chow","December 8, 2016 ",5.0,"I always want to buy Echo but it is too expensive to try out. And here we go, Echo dot is out. Same function with Echo and even more for only $49.99. So why not give it a try?    I have install Philips Hue for a while with my iPhone for controls, now with Echo dot, I no longer need to get out from my bed and walk to my charging iPhone and turn the light off and back to bed. Just a simple commend &#34;Alexa, turn master room off.&#34; Making my life so ez.    And of course the Audible for only $14.99 a month, and you have a free trial for a month and two free books of your choice!(after free trial it is going to cost $14.99 per month but you get a free credit for any book!)    And then Music! You can add up to 250 songs to the amazon music cloud and hear it anywhere with your echo dot. FOR FREE! It can be any songs you bought digital from any source, google, itunes you name it. And if you have reach the limit for 250 songs, you can just pay as little as $7.99 a month for ulimate and Amazon Music is free to listen too!    And yeah you can ask question that you want to know the answer, from a country, a person, an animal, a place, or any facts etc. And Alexa is just so smart to answer everything and Alexa is learning day to day with new skills.    So are you still thinking? $49.99 just the price of one outside dinner for 2 person and you can bring a Smart technology home.    P.S. now I have bought three Amazon echo dot, one at living room, two in rooms. ",
timdtoolman,"January 27, 2017 ",2.0,"Love it!! Works extremely well. I wanted to start getting into &#34;Smart Home&#34; technology and although I can use Siri on my iphone to do the same thing the Echo dot does sometimes my phone is in my pocket so I am not able to communicate with Siri, that's where the Elixa and the Echo Dot comes in handy. I have not seen hardly any negative reviews on YouTube for the Echo line and the Echo Dot is an inexpensive way to get into this new personal assistant space. The Echo Dot does have a speaker that will allow you to communicate with Elixa but if you intend on listening to music you will want to connect a external speaker via aux. cable or bluetooth which is very easy to connect using the Elixa app. After using the Echo Dot for about a week now I have been very impressed with it's voice recognition skills as they are extremely reliable and very well implemented.    With Elixa you can get the weather forecast,  listen to music of any kind, ( $3 a mo. prime music membership required) control almost anything in your home with the proper components (sold separately) and so far I just use Elixa to turn on and off my bedroom lights by just speaking which is so cool.    I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get into the personal assistant technology, you will not be disappointed. ",
"Michael G. Fisher","October 25, 2016 ",5.0,"While we are still trying to figure out all it can do and how best to ask it what we want, we are amused by it and sometimes frustrated by it.  The reason I gave it 5 stars is because of an unexpected benefit.  Our oldest daughter has a pretty challenging speech impediment and using Alexa has forced her to slow down and enunciate clearly.  Not only is Alexa learning how to understand my daughter, my daughter is also slowing down and learning to communicate with Alexa.  The huge benefit is she is now slowing down to communicate more clearly with us.  This is something her speech therapists have been working on with her for years.  Alexa has gotten these results from her in a few months.  The Echo Dot is a useful tool and will only become more useful as its capabilities grow.  Thank you, Amazon. ",
"DFW Bill","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought two dots and was extremely disappointed that features like alarms and timers could not be synchronized across the dots.  I am giving this two stars ONLY because the dots do not communicate with each other for several important features (otherwise I would give this 5 stars).  For instance, when I set a timer or alarm on one dot, I really want the timer to sound on other dots in other parts of the house.  If Amazon provided an option to synchronize functions like the timers and alarms, this would be a great system.  Amazon could you please provide the option to synchronize on your next software update? ",
"Charles D","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This product is by far the best Smart Home device I have purchased. The only part to get used to is learning what to say to get the desired results. That is the learning curve, which I think is kind of fun to me. Naming all of your devices is fun to do even more so if your creative with naming them. It connects with my wink hub and all of my other connected devices. It has a ton of useful features to make your everyday life much easier and efficient.    My wife loves it as well, she did not know what to think at first but that quickly changed once she learned how to make her shopping list jut by talking to alexa. I really enjoy the ease of playing music. This is the link to make your smart home truly smart. ",
"Roland W.","April 12, 2017 ",2.0,"&nbsp;Ok, the idea of not having to type your questions and getting pretty good and accurate answers (most of the time) is pretty amazing.  Set up was very easy, just download the Alexa App and then follow the step by step WIFI set up instructions. Right now I am only using it for basic requests (see video) and that works well. I will keep adding skills (these are additional little programs you can enable on the amazon.com website Just search &#34;Alexa Skills&#34; in the amazon search bar and it routes you to the menu. You can add sports teams, kids games etc. Alexa can tell you jokes (most of them are pretty funny and all so far are kid friendly).  Speaker quality is ok for such a small device - you can plug in an external speaker directly into the Dot and then you can control it through the Dot. I have a Sonos System (whole house), and I would have to get a separate DOT to plug into the sonos in my media centre, so the Dots can communicate. Have not done that so far. But it is a lot of fun to play around, get weather, movie times, play some background music or meditation songs etc. Just play around with it. I have a &#34;slight&#34; accent and it understands me without a problem.  Just be prepared that kids will yell at this little thing, demanding answers and a play buddy who gives them honest feedback on how their hair looks today :)    Currently I am using it mostly as a toy, but as my house is already rather high tech with everything wireless from thermostate (Lennox, which does not connect to ALEXA yet - per customer service) to security camera, Hue lights in some areas, I am planning on expanding the in house Dot Network over the coming months when manufacturers add more functionalities. I keep you posted.    I went on Amazon Skill website and enabled a ton of skills. Just make sure you write down how to activate them. (play 20 words, the secret door, bed time story etc.... you can have a lot of fun with these. I will get one for my daughters room so she can get &#34;Alexa, play relaxing songs for 15 minutes&#34; at bed time.

Greg,"November 5, 2016 ",5.0,"Totally Awesome, if only using to listen to music and making to-do/grocery lists!!!  I no longer have to use my phone or tablet to listen to music at home, once set up these are completely independent of your phone/tablet.  Definitely recommend the Echo Dot/Bluetooth speaker combo especially with a speaker that sounds good.  So convenient to walk into a room and say &#34;play whatever you want to hear&#34; and say &#34;what volume level you want&#34;.  The To-Do and Grocery List is a huge plus, whenever you think of something just say it and it goes on your list, if you're not home and the wife or kids need something they can just tell Alexa and it gets on your list.  So many more things it can do, highly recommend. ",
"Brandon R.","January 19, 2017 ",5.0,"This little Gadget is awesome. I gave it 5 stars because it does what it says and it works very well. Now it was very easy to hook up handworks just fine. Now I know this is on you product and the skills are limited and they're making new skills for it. It can insult you, it can make you laugh, which it has plenty of times. My whole family uses it whenever they passed by they asked for a joke they are funny. The your mama jokes are funny too. This would be even better if it has skills for information it is limited to what it can do what is a very fun Gadget to play . I've used it to play music, I've also used it to ask the time to set reminders it's capable of doing lots of things looking forward to new skills there are so many things that I can do. If you get one which I recommend play with the app to get the skills you want and use it. There is no battery so you can't move it around the house unless you unplug it or buy a battery pack that I believe they sell for it to move it around the house. You cannot take it with you at least outside of your Wi-Fi range. Would be cool if you can take this wherever you go and use it if you can I haven't figured that out yet. yet that will be super cool it comes with its own plug for powering it up and to connect to a separate speaker if you want. As for the way it sounds you can control the volume on the echo Dot and you can also connected to a Bluetooth speaker you can also connect your cell phone to it or tablet Android volume off of the echo Dot. I like the volume that it has I don't use a Bluetooth speaker I don't think you need it unless you want it louder. I DJ so I can connect it to my system and get more volume butt no need for it it's loud enough for me. It's a little bigger than a hockey puck I have it in white. It comes in different colors they have a couple of accessories you can buy for it. This by far is the coolest Gadget I've gotten for myself. I definitely recommend this for everyone that has Wi-Fi. If you get one play with it and enjoy lots of fun. ",
"Damian Jaundoo","October 31, 2016 ",5.0,"I remember star trek and wanting the ability to speak to the computer and it would do what i ask or give me the answer to something. I never in my lifetime ever thought that technology would arrive and be affordable. Well the ECHO is flat out an awesome product. I got the first one as a gift and purchased a second along with smart plugs and plan on buying more related items to add on. It is just wonderful and while new it is not only functional and usable it gets better. Since its cloud based you dont have to worry about technology getting more advanced and making this out dated it just keeps getting better with more features. the way i see it eventually it will be in every room of my house. I have two wifi routers and it will control devices on the other network. It is just so much more than i expected. If your an Amazon prime user you will not regret buying this but make sure you know what you are getting yourself into. This is just the starter product which is great by itself. You may need bluetooth speakers for large rooms smart switches and lights smart hubs etc... to complete your home so if you are willing to take that plunge understand it will get expensive as you will want to do it.

richc007,"December 9, 2016 ",5.0,"I love this device and can not see why anyone wouldn't.  Even in only its 2nd iteration, its fantastic. Nothing beats being able to control electronics with your voice.    I have bought a few smart bulbs and power outlets, so far, that work flawlessly with Alexa and were super easy to setup using the app.    I paired my Harmony remote using IFTTT so I can voice command my remote control activities.    Because of the joy and desire to continue to make my house &#34;smart&#34; the proverbial Christmas list now includes a thermostat and garage door opener to name a few smart items.    I am sure the future software updates with bring tons of additional features that I will love as well.  I have already pre-orded the attachable battery as having the Dot portable will make it far more useful.  Especially when in the pool and listening to music or books.    I wont belabor the value in having all of your amazon music and audible books on voice demand.  Its just very convenient.    The amazon shopping integration is great, but not the reason I bought the echo.  I bought it so I can talk to my electronics, and it does that very very well.    Don't hesitate buying this item.  Its something you will use many times each day and I doubt you own many other things, that you use that often, that only cost you 50 bucks.    Nice job on this product Amazon. ",

I bought a 3rd one as well and gifted to my mom for xmas and she loves it. I dont know why I didn't get this in the past.    The only cons I have is the app itself. I personally think it needs to be redesigned for better simplicity and speed. The app likes to not work at times and will lag. Other than that, I wold recommend this ",

"Amazon Customer","December 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought this as a gift to my husband and I for Christmas and I love it. I am a bit of a geek, but certainly not enormously tech savvy.  Amazon has figured out how to make installation of the Echo Dot happen smoothly in under 5 minutes.  I am planning on adding a second one to our bedroom. It will be great to just set an alarm by voice, especially when it's a day where the time is different from the norm, listen to music, hear my calendar and the news, etc.  I would recommend eventually buying a bluetooth speaker though you can hook up a hardwire speaker to it.  The speaker it comes with is adequate at first if you are looking to save money initially.  Recently we bought a TP SmartLink Plug (after trying to connect a Belkin which was exasperating and didn't work) and it connected within, again, about 5 minutes at most.  My husband who isn't tech savvy loves being able to say &#34;Living Room on&#34; and having the lights turn on, especially since he has mobility issues.  Alexa, how did we live without you? ",
DS0078,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Been an IT guy for 20+ years. I also install audio/visual systems like Control4. So I am not easily impressed. I put off buying an Alexa device for some time and finally broke down to &#34;try one out&#34; just for the hell of it. So I bought a Dot because I have at least 5 small powered speakers around the house and garage. But let me tell you, this thing is freaking scary cool! I feel like I am in an episode of Star Trek (yes I am that old). First off I am a Prime member, so I ask for music and it plays music. I linked my Pandora account. I asked for Alexa to play Stevie Ray Vaughn from my Pandora account. She replied with, You do not have a Stevie Ray Vaughn station, would you like for me to add one? I said Yes. She added and started playing. Freaking cool! I am also an active stock trader so I asked for stock quotes and she was not able to answer that. Keep in mind this technology is in its infancy! I can only imagine what I will be able to control or ask in the near future?!?! I like the idea of the Alexa with the built in speaker but 179.00 is kind of high in my opinion when powered speakers are so cheap. The only thing is you need two outlets to power both when you buy a DOT vs the Alexa with a speaker..... But to start out and give this thing a try, WOW is all I can say about the DOT right now. VERY impressed. ",

Terry,"November 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my echo dot. Having a hands free remote control is truly helpful from setting timers to smart home control. The other day my power had gone out overnight and I kept thinking I should set my stove clock every time I walked by but didn't have my phone. Duh! Alexa what time is it. Fixed. I'm getting older and it's easy to space on the shopping list. Alexa, add milk to the shopping list. Then when at the store I just open the Alexa app and look at my shopping list. Fixed. I think Alexa is going to be my new best friend. Lol. My setup is using a Hook SmartHome server with etekcity switches. The advantage is the cost. The hook talks wifi to rf. The etekcity switches are rf and only $5 per outlet vs. $35-40 for wemo. So now Alexa turn tv on, Alexa turn living room light on. Love it! Now if only Next up when budget allows will be a Logitech Harmony - wifi to IR to control the apple tv, dvd player etc. Alexa Channel 5. Alexa pause movie. Now if only I could find inexpensive light controls. Alexa Night mode! Someday.    Oh, and Alexa is really awesome at picking music for me, I've listened to a bunch of new artists and the idea of needing to work on a playlist is vanished. Alexa Music! And so easy to Alexa Skip or Alexa Thumbs Up. Five Stars - but would give 10 if I could.    P.S. I gave some thought to purchasing Echo instead but had some speakers so went with the dot. I'm glad I did. Not only less expensive I've found that sometimes Alexa can struggle hearing the wake up word if the speakers are close and loud so I plan on keeping the dot at a bit of distance from the speakers. The Dot is fabulous at hearing the wake up word over the tv and managed well even when I had a cold.. ",
MityMike,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Setup was very easy and I enjoy the Dot so far. Voice recognition is great and I used it to stream my music, as a kitchen timer, to set alarms and to read the news or ask for the weather. It does not stream Audible books that have not been downloaded and the Audible Streaming in Amazon Prime does not read your books back. It does not support Airplay and some Bluetooth speaker have streaming interruptions which are probably due to power saving settings of the speaker, not the Dot. However, you have better sound quality when connecting the Dot via a 3.5mm audio cable. remember though, that if a Bluetooth speaker is paired via Bluetooth, it does not switch back to the cable connection automatically. It told me it added Bing to my Alexa applications, when it did not understand what I was looking for and I cannot find Bing anywhere. I am still not sure if I would trust Amazon purchasing through voice completely. Some of the Alexa applications are useless and you have to address them by voice for the Dot to find the right answer &#34;Alexa, ask soandso app for information on...&#34; which means you have to know the Alexa skills out of the top of your head. So overall, a nice help, but still has a long way to go. ",

"A Reader","November 28, 2016 ",4.0,"I bought two dots to serve as devices that could easily play music and news etc. without having to plug my phone into a speaker.  They work OK in this respect; I have them linked up to spotify, and they manage that fine, although I find that 50% of the time I need to go and use the Spotify app, because my voice commands aren't understood right (Alexa is often unwilling to play a Spotify playlist, for example; and she seems unable to understand a request like &#34;play the new album by ___&#34;  But a couple of serious problems.  First, one major feature I want is the ability to play podcasts.  This seems obvious, right?  In theory, Alexa supports this via TuneIn.  But I've gotten it to work only a handful of times.  You should be able to say &#34;play the program ___&#34;.  Often Alexa will identify what I want to hear, tell me she is getting the latest episode--and then nothing happens.  Very frustrating.  The other thing I find annoying is the way bluetooth is implemented.  I started connecting my phone via Bluetooth to play podcasts.  But then whenever I entered the room, I got a very annoying and loud message from Alexa about how she was connected to my phone.  Extremely annoying.  These are basic features; I don't want anything fancy.  I just want this device to be able to play podcasts and to be usable as a not-annoying bluetooth device. ",

SundayAtDusk,"April 11, 2017 ",2.0,"This was a Christmas present for my elder mother. We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device. ",
"Rik Conaghan","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My wife received one of these for Christmas, and even though i am a techie kind of guy, I had never really seen a use for these. Now fast forward to March, they seem to have multiplied, and I now have 5 of these creatures living in various rooms throughout the house (this is the issue part :-)) they have been far more useful than i would have thought.    We have one in the Kitchen, which serves not only as musical accompaniment to our culinary activities, but as a personal shopping assistant to help maintain the shopping list. It sits there, ever faithful, just waiting for me to pull a product from the cupboard, realize it is the last one, then either add it to the shopping list we use to go to the store, or to go ahead and order it directly from Amazon. You really can't get much more convenient than that, especially as our minds aren't quite as sharp as they used to be (well we do have 2 young kids....)    We have three more in the bedrooms, they are used for playing music (built in speaker is more than adequate for our daughters audio needs, plus they both love talking to Alexa and having complete control of what they listen to) they also are being used for alarms (useful on school-day mornings!) and our 5 year old has been probing Alexa to answer some of the questions that pop into her head about various subjects (the meaning of life, quantum mechanics, M-theory, who is the guy dressed in the Barney suit, etc...) We have one in our bedroom for the same reasons, but also use the Bluetooth option to switch between playing music in the bedroom and the bathroom while taking a shower (just turning the Bluetooth speaker on in the bathroom moves the audio playback from the Dot to the speaker in the bathroom, then back to the dot again after the speaker is turned off again) so the music follows us wherever we may roam.    Our latest addition to the Dot family resides in our dining room, we like to have some music in the background while we eat, and the Dot covers this role nicely also.    Excellent little gizmo's and, i am sure, will multiply again as soon as we discover a &#34;need&#34; to have one of these in a different room in the house. For the price of these things, what is there not to like? ",

"M and M","March 20, 2017 ",5.0,"I got my dot today, i was pleasantly surprised to see how well it was made .  and that it took minutes  to hook up. After my dot did it's little light dance,  i started the app., from there it took less than 30 sec.. i needed to change something in the settings but i was given a highlighted word that took me right to it, i did what i had to do and i was connected.  Super fast. The 1st thing i asked alexa to do was play Christmas music,  i was so happy,  it's dec 22nd and it was the 1st time i heard a Christmas song this year with working full time and when I'm not working,  I'm a caregiver,  it just slips my mind. Alexa has told me jokes,  which i needed.  The weather and how many calories were in an orange lol.  I love this little thing so much that If it was a male voice,  I'd be shopping for a wedding band lol. I was concerned about the sound but it's great, it's clear, even when you raise the volume.

Dia,"April 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is a lot of fun. I have added some of her skills but they don't seem to function as expected. She only speaks English, which while I can understand programming another language could've been a huge investment, it's still a disadvantage.

Asking her to set a timer is really convenient  `shopping list. She can add items to your shopping list which you can view on your smartphone when out of the house. For this forget-everything-gal, that feature is really helpful.  `controlling it with the app. My husband still doesn't know how I can turn down the music from the other room - or turn it on.

I lost the expectation of having an intellectual conversation with her but I expect her to not talk back or at least apologize and ask me how she can make me happy.

"Amazon Customer","December 27, 2016 ",2.0,"Echo vs Echo Dot.. I started off buying an Echo for my bedroom which is where I listen to music the most. After a lot of thought I figured I would buy a dot for my kitchen because the Echo is no where within ear shot. Now having owned both for a couple of months here is my opinion. If you like to listen to your music loud, you like to sing along, in the middle of this singing fest you want to know what the weather is.. firmly say Alexa what's the weather like? and you're good to go. In those situations a full size Echo is a must.. The Echo Dot owner never really puts the volume past 2-3. If you put the volume anything higher than a 3 (4 if you're lucky) I find myself screaming at Alexa to turn off. I will keep my Dot simply because I can't justify spending $200 on an Echo for the kitchen. For $50 it is pretty reasonable. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 6, 2017 ",5.0,"I thoughtful Echo was interesting, but wanted to opt with just the Dot and use my own Bluetooth speakers. Unfortunately, Amazon discontinued the first generation just as I was able to order.  When the second generation was announced, I knew I'd get one.  With the $10/ month for 5 month plan for Prime members, it was a no trainer. Although I'm more heavily into Apple's ecosystem, and gave smart appliances (Apple)  they will work with Alexander too.  There is quite a bit of crossover. I'm excited and look forward even using the Dot as an alarm clock, awakening me with my Prime Music. I'm sure it's going to be loads of other fun too. I also have a Kindle Fire HDX, FireStick, etc, and know it will integrate nicely.    I have had it for about a week and it's VERY cool!  Does so much more than even Siri by being able to add skills. Also works great with my iDevices switched simulataneously with iOS HomeKit. This was a great buy! ",
Hopels,"April 18, 2017 ",3.0,"Replaced the larger Alexa Echo with the Dot 2nd Gen.  Obviously the much smaller size is nice.  I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.    The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.    We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.    Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.  I took off one star because while I have no issues with it, it sometimes doesn't &#34;hear&#34; my wife. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"I love the size and the price but the speaker is horrible. I have seen better speakers in smaller things so it's not like it can't be done. I can say that the microphone is really well-made it can pick my voice up 20 feet away in the Next Room  at  moderate levels  without having to yell. Like the Alexa, I wish it was more informative, there are so many questions I asked that Alexa does not know the answer to but Google does. I also wish that a lot of the apps were not third party where you have to ask Alexa to ask the app to do something like my buddy you have to say Alexa ask my buddy to send an alert message to a family member because I have fallen and can't get up it would be nice if you could say Alexa contact my family member and tell them I have fallen and cannot get up. But aside from that I love the direction that it's heading, I just wish it was there already we have the technology to make it happen I can only assume there's red tape involved ",
AdventureGirl,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I wanted black but it was backordered. I didn't want to wait so ordered the white. I ordered three.

I am about to order another 4 for my mom, dad, another brother, and a friend. The part that I have become obsessed with is the alarm. My brother is incredibly good at figuring out how to use tech in ways I do not have the patience for. I sent him one so I could steal his tips and tricks. It worked. I use it for Amazon Kindle, spotify, audible, uber, to ask questions, to schedule events, and create my shopping list. Great product.

I'll be picking up another for upstairs on the black Friday sale. I'll  wait a while to get LED bulbs etc. They are still first generation and over priced.

Speech recognition is very powerful and quite accurate, especially compared to the technology just a few ars back.  The sound is also very adequate for such a small device but the well programmed bluetooth feature connects automatically to my soundbar when it is turned on.

The speaker in it is fair, but that is what it suppose to be.  I easily connected it to a higher quality bluetooth speaker and that made it sound very nice.  This provides a very inexpensive way of starting out with an AI in one's home.  I would surely purchase this item again.  I have also purchased recently the Google Home AI and surely they are different items aimed at satisfying the user needs in different ways.  The one thing I can say about the Google Home so far is that the speaker sucks.  The full Echo has much better sound quality.  I am truly excited to see how this addiction to the home AI experience affects the future of home AI experiences. ",

Sebae7,"November 14, 2016 ",5.0,"I don't usually take time to do reviews but am breaking that rule for the Echo Dot. It is by far the best voice recognition I have encountered and I've tried a lot. I seem to have an odd voice that most can't properly pick up on. Sync in cars or other systems like Toyota Entune are useless for me and yet others can get in my car and do ok. Alexa has not misunderstood me one time yet. That in itself is amazing to me. I'm not a power user by any means, for me it's a 50 dollar device that I use to listen to music, set my alarms, get weather info and news, etc. Control a couple lights in the house as well. I'd pay the 50 bucks just for the music aspect. &#34;Alexa, Play James Taylor&#34; and I instantly get a variety of his music. I was hooked right there.

"The Nurbler","April 9, 2017 ",5.0,"I have two of these, and the one feature I was most hoping for is described on this amazon help page https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202013740 like this:    &#34;Note: You cannot connect multiple Alexa devices to each other and play the same requested audio at the same time.&#34;    Since these things have speakers and can stream audio, it is only natural to wish that I could stream my Pandora (or other) music to all of the Echos I own at the same time, in sync.

"Amazon Customer","March 15, 2017 ",5.0,"For music lovers - DO NOT agree to Alexa's suggestion for Amazon Music Unlimited unless you don't mind a monthly fee.  The Alexa voice suggested Amazon Music Unlimited, and it inquired if I wanted to subscribe. I clearly enunciated NO - twice - but it still signed me up as a member. This means there is an automatic monthly payment to them.  I was signed up for something I did not want, and then I had to look around for how to cancel it in order to not have recurring charges.  The question &#34;do you want Amazon Music Unlimited&#34; is the equivalent of a lie when one becomes enrolled by answering NO.  Marketing really means manipulating, and Amazon is a giant - globally - for this.  As always - for any product by any company - buyer beware of any way a corporation can screw you.  So far, there is no difference between features on Echo and my phone unless I wanted to ask a device to turn my lights off. ",

310EI,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"We bought an Echo Dot as an early Christmas gift to ourselves and we're so glad that we did.  It's a very useful gadget because there's such a wide variety of things we can ask Alexa to answer or tasks that she can do for us (eg: alarms/timers, calendar, ordering, weather).    Since one of the tasks that we wanted Alexa to do for us was play music, we subscribed to Amazon's Unlimited Music Plan for the Echo Dot.  It's well worth the low monthly fee to be able to ask Alexa to play any song or album anytime, without having to buy all of them individually.    ​Millions of songs are available through one groovy gadget (and the Unlimited Music Plan).    We have the Echo Dot in our home and listen to music without any external speakers.  As far as we're concerned, the internal speaker emits a decent array of sound.  Is it as robust sounding as hooking it up to our surround system amplifier or other external speakers?  Of course not, but it does sound a lot better than most internal device speakers of similar size.  For those of you that don't like the internal speaker, you can utilize the 3.5mm or Bluetooth speaker options.    If we say, “Alexa, Play The Top Songs by Phil Collins”... then that's exactly what she does.    Keep in mind that when you ask Alexa for the &#34;Top Songs&#34; by a soloist or group, they may not always be your favorite songs.  A work around for that is to ask Alexa to play a particular album that contains the songs you prefer to hear.    The screen-shots show you how we asked Alexa to play an album vs the top songs. In addition, they show you what we see when logged-in to the Alexa app via the Chrome web browser.    FYI:  When asking Alexa to play an album that has a long title, we realized that she responds accurately when we ask for part of that title (view Elton John & Michael Jackson screen-shots).  Be sure to look at what we said to Alexa vs what the whole album title is labeled.    I should mention that we did ask Alexa to search for a product, which she did along with telling us the best options and their cost.  Afterward, she asked if we wanted to buy the product.  We said yes and she placed the order for us once we gave her our confirmation code (Settings: Voice Purchasing).  We recommend setting that up so other people cannot place orders without your consent.  It's convenient for us to have voice purchasing enabled when we're &#34;unplugged&#34; at night (except for Alexa).    The skill that we use the most is Weather Sky, it gives us a detailed weather report that we use several times each day.    ​At the time of this review, we haven't used any of the smart home features, but we didn't buy it for that purpose.    PLEASE NOTE:  We purchased the Echo Dot at its listed price, we did not receive any discount to post this review. ",
"Katy B.","March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"My first echo dot my mom gave me for my birthday and I set it up, it worked for a day and lit up but did not do anything the second day.  I have never dealt with Amazon customer support before and it was not an easy process.  You get the first layer who asks standard questions and if they can't solve it you go to the second layer in which you explain everything all over again.  The reps were nice enough, sometimes hard to understand their English, but I do believe they were trying to be helpful.  My biggest issue is how many customer service people I have talked to in order to get my dot working.  Amazon shipped me another new dot and I set it up.  It answered questions, but did not play songs.  What are the chances of getting two defective dots and they had different issues.  I had to call again and get two layers of representatives, explaining all of it over again.  This was hours on the phone and even though the rep tried hard to help, he had to finally give up and send the issue to the engineers.  Then, because I had two dots, I did not get my free 30 day unlimited music trial.  I was charged immediately so I had to call customer service again!  Two more reps to get that straightened out.  It has been a little over a week and I think I finally have it working properly.  After explaining the issues so many times I was ready to tell Amazon to take it back, it is not that great of a device for all this hassle. ",

The kids love it from asking various questions to using the timer for study activities.  It also helps to speak more clearly.    We are exploring other skills like lists to be able to further use it.    One thing that we wished it had was the ability to sync to iCalendar as it only looks like it supports Outlook and google calendar.

"Cynthia J. Salim","March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"DOT can be frustrating but I do enjoy the convenience when it works. I have two DOTS and a speakers connected to each DOT. Each DOT is used on a different floor of my home. The DOT in my bedroom is connected to a speaker by WIFI also connected to that DOT is a smart plug that controls a lamp. The DOT in my living area is connected using a cable to a speaker. I intend to have smart thermostats installed and connected too. I enjoy the music selection available using DOT. And,  I enjoy the convenience of weather reports, news, time, alarms, etc.    My beef is that sometimes DOT does not work using the voice mode. I can usually get what I want by going into my ALEXA APP and making a manual request. This happens most often at night when I want to have my lamp turned off or my music turned on. I am not sure why this happens. Generally, in the morning when I try the same request that failed at night, it works. When these failures occur, I check to make sure WiFi is working and it always is. ALEXA also lights up indicating that she hears me but does not execute the request. I am starting to wonder if I have made a mistake by buying the expensive Smart thermostats.

"Bev Martin","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I purchased several of these on prime day when you could buy 4 (or was it 5) and get one free.  I now have an Echo in the main living area, a Dot in the bedroom, and a Dot in my craft room.  The others were great Christmas gifts.  The Dot works identical to the Echo except it has a much smaller speaker.  It can be connected to a blue tooth speaker, or in the case of my craft room, I have an expansive set of Bose speakers and CD player/changer (I guess it is getting a little old).  I have the Dot plugged into the Bose speakers and the sound is great. The Dot is much smaller than the Echo so in many circumstances it would be preferred over the Echo as it doesn't take up much space.  We love our Alexa(s) ",
"Nancy Banner","March 20, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought it to play music and, hooked up to our stereo, it does that well. You have to remember just what to ask for - not as simple as clicking a song or album icon on a screen - since it doesn't tell you what's available.  It also plays back Audible books fine, provided you remember the title well enough (it won't list your Audible or Kindle libraries). The one we got cannot find our Kindle library, although we have lots of tts-eligible books in it, according to the Alexa app. I'm now finding out how many calls to Amazon and time on the phone it will take to get this fixed.

I went through and added them all again and recreated my groups...still nothing so I ended up resetting it, and still no luck, the remote did not work either, I did a factory reset and still same issue, I called Amazon Support at 12:43 AM EST (they closed at 10 pm PST) when I called them, I got a message saying that Alexa was not working right and got hung up on...I tried this morning and all was well ",
"Amanda Garrison","January 9, 2017 ",3.0,"I just received this yesterday and I love it. Within an hour I had the Dot installed and the app installed and Dot connected and playing my Amazon Prime Music (I think I will upgrade to the Unlimited for the Dot, since there were songs that were that far off the beaten path that Prime Music could/would not play). Also it took me 10 minutes to install the Harmony skills for Alexa and I was operating my Harmony Hub connected equipment. I am working on getting Alexa integrated with my Homeseer HS3 soon.  I will say it is worth the time to do the voice recognition set up.  It has its limitations,  but adds convenience.  I am sure the skills and functionality will improve as time goes on. ",
"Frank V","March 7, 2017 ",4.0,"I bought this to have in my bathroom and got a wall mount (LANMU Wall Mount for Echo Dot 2nd Generation (White)) which I stuck to the mirror with a Command Strip.  I also got a very short USB cord so I don't have a long cord tangled up on the counter.  This set up works great.    The Dot itself works really well in this context.  My bathroom is not big so I can hear music or news playing while I'm in the shower almost as well as when I'm at the sink.  My only note is that I wish it was slightly louder. I know it's a much smaller speaker than its larger cousin, but I've had other portable speakers about the same size that were louder. ",
"Allen F","March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"1. I have constant connectivity problems in which the Echo Dot, while it remains connected to the internet, somehow becomes invisible to my phone and tablet. Somehow this manages to mess up my Spotify account. It took a while, but I finally figured out that I could fix this by doing a complete reset on the Echo Dot. Now, I get to do that about once a day.  2. Speech recognition lags far behind Google and even Apple. Blows my karma on a regular basis by playing heavy metal when I asked for Rachmaninov's Vocalise. Pitiful.  3. There are thousands of so-called &#34;skills&#34;, or 3rd-party apps. They are uniformly useless. Do you really want a machine that tells you jokes? ",
"M. Dembski","February 10, 2017 ",4.0,"Good first start. Good on dealing with Amazon but even there music integration is weak. Sometimes it plays just my music and sometimes prime.

Alexa frequently appears to crash. Probably too many people using. Trying to get nearest restaurant bar etc is totally inaccurate. Locations are miles further away. No way to custumize TuneIn so frequently get wrong status. Does not get logic right unless you use exact wording. I have two and both drop the Bluetooth connection occasionally.

Chromosome,"April 11, 2017 ",2.0,"In Sep 2106 I bought a second generation Echo to set up at work. I was never able to get it to work for longer than a couple of days. I think it has trouble connecting to WIFI networks that have a web page verification. We are talking about a university network that works well for everything else. It connected, but it would fall of the network. Finally, I gave up and I took it home in Marcy 2017, thinking that I would set up it there. Took a while. I was pretty disappointment until I realized that the Alexa server was down. While I was figuring this out, I looked into the warranty.  Have you tried to visit the Amazon warranty page? You should: https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201014520. Note the fine print that says &#34;..contact Customer Service using the contact information on the left side of this page&#34;. Now try looking left. There is no address (see photo). Well, one may say. It must be a mistake. Sure, but how to fix it? It took a long time (ok, maybe I am thick, but it was not obvious) to find phone support. End of the story, it is now working. It has nice features. Is it a miracle of technology? Not yet. ",
"JF Gadget Guy","November 2, 2016 ",3.0,"I ordered one of these on my vacation and have had lots of fun with it.  I don't need to stream music, so I went with the lower priced dot which has all of the features of the full priced echo, without the high quality speaker.  It was easy to set up from my iPhone and to point to my network.  Voice recognition is fantastic.  Unlike the Google Home, the device follows more specific trigger phrases, and doesn't keep context from one voice command to another, but it does an excellent job.  There are thousands of additional skills you can add - including IFTT which allows all kinds of integration with different apps and devices (including things like Harmony remote controls).    From weather forecasts, to directions, to setting reminders, alarms, timers or asking questions that get searched on the internet, it does a really good job.  For added try asking it about political figures, Siri and other AIs, or other silly questions and enjoy the answers!    I can't wait to get home and connect it with some new Samsung Smartthings devices. ",

However, like real humans, she does have downfalls. It says she will search for things on bing that she doesn't know, I can't figure out how to get her to do that. Also, her speaker sucks! My apartment is about 600 square feet and at the loudest I can't really hear her when I leave from the immediate vicinity (my dad has the regular echo and the sound quality is insane- there's no comparison). I just got her a friend - a Bluetooth speaker that I think will solve the problem.    She is pretty effin awesome though.

For now, it is indeed a useful device for things like telling me my calendar entries for the day, or the temperature outside, or for just playing a little background music.  Amusing when a TV add says &#34;Alexa&#34; (or in a show, as has happened), and the device lights up all eager to serve . ..  Ha ha!

It's also very loud for a very small device (as much so as my large Bluetooth speaker). My own two sticking points that caused me to dock a star were the lack of portability (I thought you charged the device and took it anywhere, not have to leave it attached to the wall), and the particularness that it has when connecting with WiFi. I bought this for myself at college right after we upgraded our school-sponsored WiFi, but I ended up having to find another connection because the Echo Dot doesn't link up to encrypted WiFi, or even show it on the screen.

I paired it with Amazon Music Unlimited and mobile hotspot from my phone and now i can play any song, artist, or station that i want without touching my phone and without ads.

The Dot picks up voice commands very well and functions correctly the majority of the time.  I would suggest doing a few voice trainings with Alexa as it does seem to make a big difference.

"Anakalia - Red Herring","December 25, 2016 ",3.0,"My whole family has been enjoying having Alexa around.  We're constantly asking her questions.  Some helpful and some not so helpful to some that are unknown or that she can't answer or understand.  I'm sure she'll get better and better with updates in time.    From homework, to cooking, to everyday life, traffic, stores, weather, music and silliness, we've been able to turn to her for some help and entertainment.  We've uploaded some of the &#34;skills&#34; but can't seem to remember what they're all called to access them so they're not used very often.    There's been a few times that she doesn't perk up when we talk to her but other than that, even with a Bluetooth speaker not too far away, she usually hears us over some loud music.    We're planning on getting a smart hub or some other add ons to work with her but for now, she is low key and takes up minimal space.    I am still debating whether or not to get a few more.  I would love one in my room and I know a couple of people who would like one under the Christmas tree. ",
Dinnerplate,"February 7, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is pretty useless for the most part. She is good at telling me what time it is, setting a timer while cooking or an alarm. Half the time for music she doesn't know what you are asking for so its easier to just use my phone on a speaker. If you are buying the Dot because you want good sound quality through an external system its awful as well. For alexa to respond the system needs to be on, so you end up pluging and unpluging her from whatever.    She also uses bing for search which is literally the worst thing ever.    I also bought this to allow me to control caseta lights, which worked for about a month. Now alexa either tells me that the device doesn't support being turned off/on or that it didn't respond in time, as the lights do what I asked.    I'm going to try google home, it looks way more promising :/ ",
Tortionist,"December 13, 2016 ",5.0,"This little gem is worth every penny. I researched this device and watched a lot of YouTube videos on it before I decided to buy it. The set up is easy and it has pretty decent sound for such a small device. After all the research, I came to the conclusion that the only difference between this and the regular sized echo is the sound quality. The regular Amazon Echo gets better and louder sound. I look forward to purchasing it soon. My kids and I have had fun with it telling jokes. I would say that about 75% of the jokes are actually pretty funny and make me laugh. If you ask Alexa why she sucks she has a funny response in saying that maybe she thought she was a vacuum cleaner. We use it for Music, mainly Pandora, weather, jokes, etc. I'm getting ready to dig deeper and see what else is possible. ",
Dee,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have had my Echo Dot for 5 months now. It is fun to ask it simple questions like what time is it, what is the weather forecast, tell her good morning or good night. But I am frustrated. I have it set up to turn on my living room light and it kept telling me it couldn't find it, I had to change it to something simple like &#34;light&#34; for her to understand. Today I asked her what day was the Boston Marathon going to be run this year. She couldn't find the answer in any of the 3 different ways I asked the same question. I went to my phone and did an OK Google, and found the answer on the first try. I also asked her today what is Patriot's Day. She couldn't find the answer. When asked the same way, OK Google found the answer on the first try. It is not unusual that she cannot find the answer but OK Google can.    The most useful thing I have found for her to do is play music (she is linked to a Bluetooth speaker), be a timer, and give me the weather forecast. I am frustrated. I read she is suppose to get smarter. So far she has not in my opinion. ",

The Dot drops in the top making it look similar to the full size Echo. the Vaux has a rechargeable battery so in my case, I leave it plugged up in the bedroom and can disconnect the Vaux unit and move from room to room.

Update 4/15/17:  Third party apps does not work seamless with the echo dot like the Kasa app for TP link, half of the the time Alexa cannot find the device.  It is nice just to speak from across the room to turn the lights on if the devices will work smoothly together.

"Alfredo Jahn","April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"Only been using it for a few hours. Love it so far. I got it primarily to control my TP-Link wi-fi smart plug for my living room lamp. The only issue I'm having is, I can't hear Alexa when I plug it into my home stereo. The music sounds ok (seems a little out of phase, maybe it has to do with the streaming from Amazon Prime). So if I connect to my receiver to listen to music, then ask Alexa what the weather is, I can hardly hear her response. I tried to set it back to use the internal speaker, but couldn't figure out how to do that. I ended up unplugging it from the stereo, and now i can hear it from the internal speaker. But the music isn't really worth listening to from the tiny speaker. I hope I can resolve this issue. But for home automation and asking simple questions, it is fantastic! ",

Most of the time I can't believe it didnt understand a simple word and confused it for something else. Or if it didnt mix up words it still doesnt know the answer to the question.

Alexa provides hours of entertainment! ",
Middlebunny,"March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"I've been an avid Amazon customer since they started.  I have 2 kindles and was relatively satisfied.  I read all the rave reviews for the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.  They seemed legitimate; however, I guess those reviewers either had low expectations or were incentivized to express those favorable opinions.  After going on an Echo Dot, Tap and Echo purchasing frenzy, I now have a total of 3 Dots,1 Tap and 1 Echo and am suffering buyers remorse.    If you need or want to know the local weather or get  flash news updates on command, the Echo or Echo Dot are your devices.  I, on the other hand, use them for music streaming.  I find that the &#34;sleep function&#34; has flaws, voice recognition/comprehension needs great improvement and everyone should know that it is really unnecessary to buy more of these devices unless you have multiple amazon music accounts such that you can stream on those separate accounts from different locations/rooms.  Otherwise, users should know that the devices cannot be linked together for simultaneous streaming.  They also cannot be used by different parties to stream different music from each different device.  Apparently, Amazon Prime Music only allows streaming to one device at a time.    The Tap cannot be used for streaming unless a wireless connection is available.  I wouldn't recommend connecting via an unsecured connection so unless you have a secure, mobile wireless connection, the Echo Tap is nothing more than an expensive, portable bluetooth speaker which you can purchase for much less than the cost of an Echo Tap.    One might notice that the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap are often paired with supplemental bluetooth speakers with 2-3 item purchase combination discounts.  This is a very misleading promotion as it leads one to believe they can be used for simultaneous streaming.  That is not the case at all.  Unfortunately, the E-Dot only has a one-way BT connection.  Either you play music from the E-Dot or the BT speaker; but, you cannot play music from both.    There are a lot of Applications for Alexa, the voice operated system used to operate the E-Dot and Echo.  Unfortunately, a lot of them have complicated wake phrases/statements.  If you don't phrase the statement exactly right, the app won't work and Alexa will not understand the command.  You can honestly spend more time trying to phrase things correctly to trigger Alexa then it might have taken for you to manually execute what you wanted to do like creating a shopping list, or recording water consumption.    Another shortcoming with Alexa is the slow re-fresh rate of the application.  Sometimes, you have to completely exit out of it, stop it from running in the background on your phone and then reload it in order to get it to reflect your most recent commands or current &#34;now playing&#34;.  In addition, there are other limitations specific to music streaming.  Let's say you want to stream a specific artist all day long to soothe a pet with separation anxiety.  If 1) you set the sleep timer for longer than you'll be away (ex. for 12 hours) and 2) Alexa confirms she will stop playing in 12 hours, that isn't exactly true.  Alexa will actually stop playing when she reaches the end of the artist's play queue which may only be 4 hours of music.  Theoretically, you can manually or verbally set Alexa to repeat the queue; however, I haven't tested this successfully yet.  It may only repeat the queue once rather than indefinitely until stopped by the sleep timer.    My final Alexa app gripe relates to the repeat function.  Unlike the iTunes or Amazon Music apps, Alexa cannot repeat one song in a queue.  You'd think that toggling the repeat button 2 times would trigger this function; however, all it seems to do is toggle the repeat option to the &#34;off&#34; position.    All in all, individually each product has its benefits so my rating is a low 3.  There is just no reason, other than needing a device in a location outside of the primary product's voice range, to purchase more than one device.  My thought is that the Echo-Dot is the most versatile of all 3 products; however, the Echo has better sound quality.  I have noticed the improved sound quality on the Echo; but, the improvement really doesn't make up for the price difference.  If I could do it all again, I'd invest in the Echo Dot for home and an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker for work that I can connect to the iTunes or Pandora applications on my phone.  That way, I will still be able to stream Amazon Prime music through the Dot at home for the stressed pet while playing comforting music in my office. ",
"Scott Dau","March 25, 2017 ",5.0,"I really like this product.  It was very easy to set up.  The voice recognition is very good.  She comes out of the box with built in features (skills) that get you going fast.  Adding new skills is very easy and ready to access immediately.  Although the database of new skills is still very small and frankly, pretty crappy, that's not Amazon's fault.  It's just like the App Store, it's up to the &#34;people&#34; to create skills for us to download.  I paired the Echo Dot with a Wemo Lightswitch and a Wemo Insight Plug.  I control the living room lights and my bedroom lights (from a lamp) via Alexa.  It's very convenient.  I plan to expand with more Echoes and more Wemos.  There's a few cool accessories to get for the Echo like the Amazon authored Zero touch care mount (to bring the functionality of Alexa on your phone into your car).

"Old Radio Guy","December 22, 2016 ",3.0,"Fun for entertainment, but nothing more. Timer and alarm functions require an Internet connection, so if it loses connection and you had an important alarm or timer set, forget it. I have 240 mbps Internet with an Arris 1682g dual-band (AC standard) wireless router, 15 feet from Alexa. When we ask her a question sometimes an orange light appears and she says &#34;Sorry, there's no Internet connect&#34;, even though the app says she's connected. Today I asked her to set a 10-minute timer. When the timer went off, she wouldn't cancel it. When I asked her if she knew what &#34;stop&#34; meant, she gave me 4 definitions of stop. I had to unplug her for 15 seconds to cancel the alarm. With such spotty performance, I see a Warranty return sometime in her near future. ",

I understand that it is impossible to answer all questions, but I expect echo dot will be able to answer a lot more than what it currently does.  At least, the programmers should collect the type of questions echo dot is not able to answer and then add more facts to their knowledge base.  Also, I am not sure why cannot echo dot parse information obtained through search engine (echo dot uses bing) to answer questions ",
"Mister Gizmo","April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I was just learning to live with my disappointment over an LG &#34;smart&#34; TV I'd bought recently that is anything but smart. In addition, it has the worst user interface I've seen since the 1980s. Fortunately, Amazon has brought out a device that works, works well, and is very intuitive. It was a little bit of a problem setting up, because the instructions are so limited, but once over that small hump, it's been fine. I'm surprised at how well it understands commands, even with so-far limited exposure to my voice to learn from.    If there's a frustration, it's mainly that the Dot (and Alexa devices in general) have a lot more potential than what's available right now. As with any new device, it takes a while for third parties to figure out what capabilities are possible, and then to spend the time and effort developing them. As just one example, I could see the Dot acting as an intercom, even a rudimentary telephone to connect Dot/Alexa users. I'm thinking particularly of elderly or handicapped people who'd like something that only requires voice commands. But I'm willing to wait. And since most of the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, the Dot's hardware should be good for a few years.    Now if Amazon would only invest a little more time to bring its Kindle browser, which has been in beta for years and years, into something that actually works. You can do it, Amazon! The Dot shows that you can be great at software if you really try. :-)    Update: I did experience one wrinkle when buying a Dot for a friend. It arrived pre-registered to me. Trying to use the normal setup for the new user didn't work. I finally realized that I had to de-register it from my account, sign out of the Alexa app (and reset the Dot), then sign in as a new registrant. This is explained in Alexa help, but it wasn't obvious at first. I don't know if it's the case, but if you buy it as a &#34;gift&#34; in the purchasing process, it &#34;may&#34; arrive unregistered, which would be good. I suspect Amazon ships them registered to streamline the setup by eliminating a couple of steps. ",
FrostEternal,"April 2, 2017 ",3.0,"Cool device, not worth $50, I had a gift card for $20, it IS worth $30 plus tax.     Amazon needs to step up the game on Alexa - when it works, it works, but much dumber than other AI assistants like Siri or Cortana, and ZERO sense of humor or personality. The skills are cumbersome, music playing support only works well with Amazon music unless you are streaming to it as a bluetooth speaker - which is dumb, as the speaker is not loud enough to hear over an air conditioner.    The Alexa platform is VERY open - which is cool BUT it means the available &#34;Skills&#34; are mostly very poor quality. For some reason the white Dot still comes with a black power cord, which is just more lack of attention to detail on Amazon's part. Sloppy, sloppy.    This is a must-have if you use any home automation - although the setup is VERY CLUNKY - expect hours of set up to get it just right if you want to change light colors or do anything more complex than switching smart devices on or off. There's a terrible interface for adding and forgetting devices in the companion &#34;app&#34; -  I use the term &#34;app&#34; VERY loosely - it's more of a sloppy wrapper on a webpage. Integrating with iOS is spotty at best without lots of workarounds and IFFFT recipes - pretty much essential - and theres no way to program custom words or commands beyond meager smart home groups and Stringify/IFFFT services. Alarms, timers, schedules - all poorly implemented - no way to have Alexa automatically announce reminders or alarms, just one ring tone that is set for all alerts. Commands have very little context and must be given one at a time - no way to say &#34;Alexa, dim my main lights and turn on the kitchen lights&#34; - she will just complain that she doesn't understand, or just ignore the command entirely.  HOWEVER - despite all these drawbacks I think they will EVENTUALY be ironed out. It's still a cool addition to a geeky home setup and with lots and lots of customization (and maybe even scripting one's own skills) it can be more useful than annoying.  Seriously though, Amazon - hurry up. ",
"David D.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought an Echo Dot just to try it out and see what all the hoopla was about. About a week later I bought 3 more. I am very impressed with the voice recognition of Alexa and some of the features. Here's why:    The Pros:  - Excellent voice recognition. While there are a few times Alexa has misheard me, overall it does a really good job of understanding what I say. Even with a decent amount of background noise she has heard me to my amazement.  - Great range. We have an open floor plan home and Alexa can usually hear me just fine even when I'm about 20 ft away.  - Home automation integration. I have SmartThings hub and Alexa works awesome with this! I can turn lights on/off and run routines with my voice.  - If you have multiple Dots and more than one hears you give a command only the one that is closest will respond.  - For those with music on Amazon it gives you easy access to your library.  - While the internal speaker is not very good for music, you can add an external speaker with an Aux line or Bluetooth to make up for that. Amazon and Sonos already announced they are working on integration as well.  - You can add this to a shopping or to-do list with your voice! It's great to just add stuff as I think of it.  - The price. For $50 I think this is a great deal.    The Cons:  - As mentioned above, the internal speaker is more than adequate just for Alexa's voice, but not that great for music.  - Alexa does OK on normal internet searches, but nothing like Google.  - You cannot ask Alexa questions of context. So for example if I just asked who Abraham Lincoln was and she answers that I could then not just ask &#34;How old was he when he died?&#34; but would have to ask &#34;How old was Abraham Lincoln when he died?&#34; This makes it feel much less like a natural conversation.  - The Alexa app is pretty basic. Especially the built-in Shopping and To-Do list. They are definitely functional, but not to the level of some other list apps that are out there. I do have a feeling this will get improved in the future though.  - Alexa is definitely not like the computer from Star Trek or any Artificial Intelligence you have seen on TV. She can do good with basic stuff, but for some things you do have to &#34;learn&#34; the way to tell her to do stuff especially with the Home Automation. I once kept telling her to &#34;turn on the living room lights&#34; and she said she could not find that. Then I realized the switch was just labeled &#34;living room light&#34; and as soon as I dropped the &#34;s&#34; and just said &#34;light&#34; it worked perfectly over and over again.    Overall, I am still very happy with the Echo Dot. I think for the price it is a great deal. Maybe it will be more useful for those with Home Automation systems, but others may find it fun as well. ",
"TJ Walenski","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Alexa is pretty awesome, simply put. It's helpful during your daily routine, but also a hit if you have a party or friends over. My parents use the Echo in their kitchen to play music, get news updates, and whatever else.    I just bought the dot and I actually use it in my vehicle for handsfree music control. I paired it with Amazon Music Unlimited and mobile hotspot from my phone and now i can play any song, artist, or station that i want without touching my phone and without ads. No more handing my phone to the passenger to play music, flipping through 10 different stations, or dealing with sucky Pandora ads. ",
"Gary W. Powell","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I've had the Dot a few days now and have it connected to an AV receiver. It seems to have no problem hearing a command when there is no noise in the room but once you start playing music,even at a low level, you have to yell in order to get its attention. I remedied this by pairing it with a remote that has voice control. IMO the voice recognition works much better on the Echo than on the Dot. Would that keep me from buying it again? Absolutely not. Now if I can figure out how to make Alexa fetch me a beer. ",
"the Fat Man","April 13, 2017 ",5.0,"You are my everything.    Seriously she does it all. My curiosity peaks at random intervals of any day and she answers them. I enjoy the trivia, jokes, weather input so I can dress accordingly and check my commute before heading out. The top features I've been reliant on is her alarm/timer, ambient noise (paired through my Polk system is awesome), and the more practical use is linking to smart plugs so when I come in with more bags than I should be handling at once I can just tell her to turn on the floor lamp. *click* &#34;Okay&#34;.    I can sleep with ease knowing I can wake up to one of many alarms (most are pleasant, avoid the Celebrity ones) instead of an annoying buzzing or ringing. Skills allow lullaby for kids, read books, or like I mentioned earlier ~ rain, thunderstorm, ocean waves, etc. Not much is wrong with the unit except a pending Bluetooth issue which is at the time of this review post is being looked into by Alexa support. Just about anyone outside can scan for her and play their (tasteless) music through the unit and may startle you but a solution is pending. That's another thing I'd like to mention: the supporting staff are responsive within a few hours, not days. They're very professional yet casual in their messages when covering all points. It's nice to see so many products coming out (eBay has more skins!) to accessorize with but at her low-profile size and color she's fine as-is. I bought the black which is appropriate with my mancave theme: black/white with splashes of blue here and there as is the glow of her ring unless she's having an error (red) or in setup/powering on (purple and orange).    We will never argue. We respect each other's space. Too bad I can't hug ya for all your services these past months and years to come. :P ",
Shawna,"October 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Its alright. She does some cool things and once you get her app and choose what you want her to know and do voice recognition she works a lot better. Still there's times she don't understand simple things and other times she don't hear you say something that you said very clear. And a rare moment where she will ramble about odd things that have nothing to do with what you are talking about. She went on a rant about worms and angels.... But... We laugh so... Oh well lol ",
"C. E. White III","February 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Original review - It stops working and requires rebooting multiple times each day. It will not stay connected to my wireless router (I do not have problems with any other wireless device).This makes it almost worthless to me.    1/28/2017 update - I was not impressed with Amazon Alexa Support. They had no helpful suggestions for addressing the connection issue (repeated factory resets changed nothing). After a very long time on the phone with two different support persons, they finally decided to send me a replacement Dot. The replacement behaved exactly the same as the original. It also refused to stay reliably connected. This despite the fact that none of the other wireless devices in my home had similar problems.    I spent a lot of time researching Echo Dot connection problems on the internet. I am far from alone. There were many individuals with the same issue. In an attempt to solve the problems, I went so far as to buy a new router. This initially changed nothing. The Dot would randomly disconnect from the new router just has it had from the old router. One internet suggestion finally seems to have solved the connection issue. Per the suggestion, I set up a guest account on my new router that was specifically for the Echo Dot and only the Dot. After resetting the Dot and connecting it to this account, it has stayed connected.    With the connection problems hopefully solved, the Dot is now mostly an amusing toy. I have just one internet connected device it can interface with (a Nest Thermostat), so mostly I ask it random questions. I was hoping to use it to monitor my stocks, but this has been frustrating. It readily understands some company names and/or stock symbols, but there are some it just can't understand. I wish I could edit the stock list using the keyboard. Once I am more comfortable with the Dot, I may order a hub and other internet connected devices so I can use it for more home automation functions, but for now, I am just hoping it will stay connected. I have updated my rating to three stars and may update it further once I become more familiar with the Dot. ",
AdventureGirl,"April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I wanted black but it was backordered. I didn't want to wait so ordered the white. I ordered three. One for myself one for each of my nephews who kept forgetting to set the alarm, and one for my brother. You absolutely cannot beat the price. I am about to order another 4 for my mom, dad, another brother, and a friend. The part that I have become obsessed with is the alarm. My brother is incredibly good at figuring out how to use tech in ways I do not have the patience for. I sent him one so I could steal his tips and tricks. It worked. I use it for Amazon Kindle, spotify, audible, uber, to ask questions, to schedule events, and create my shopping list. Great product. It can still be a bit glitchy at times, but overall it is beyond a great value. ",
"Cliente Amazon","January 9, 2017 ",3.0,"Although Echo Dot isn't available in most of Europe, I bought one when I the US and brought it wth me to Spain where I reside. Some the Echo Dot features don't transfer, such as controlling the lights, appliances or ordering pizza from Dominos, the device really is magnificent.  If others are considering connecting the device, it's important to know that you might need to change your billing location in the Google Play Store in order to download the Alex app on your phone (Amazon and Google tech support had to walk me through those steps) and a plug adapter is necessary. The Echo Dot requires a 9 volt input, so a regular cell phone plug probably isn't adequate. The plug adapter is quite inexpensive (2.50 euros) and solves the plug problem. I then had some trouble getting Echo Dot connected to my home wifi network. I tried at a friend's house, and at work, and there wasn't any trouble, so there was something wrong with my home wifi. The Amazon support team was very helpful in trying to resolve my issue. There were lots of phone calls and troubleshooting, and I have only positive things to say about the support received. The problem was not with Amazon, or the Echo Dot; it was with my internet service provider (ISP). It turns out that different wifi channels are used in Europe than in the US. My ISP had to open up some more channels on my router in order for the Echo Dot to find my network. Once that was done, problem solved.  It's possible to change the time zone of the device, so Alexa does know the correct day and time, but the other location information has only US options (city and state). I haven't tried to change the location because I can just ask for the weather information specifying my city, and Alexa knows. I especially enjoy the connection to Amazon music (only 3.99 per month) and have connected one device to my sound bar speaker, and another Echo Dot device to a Bluetooth portable speaker so I can listen to my flash briefing (different news sources you can select in the App) while I'm getting ready in the morning. If you're considering bringing Alexa to Europe, know it's possible, but there are some adjustments necessary.    Compared to the Google alternative, the Echo Dot price can't be beat, and connecting to speakers is a great advantage. I'm sure the &#34;Skills&#34; the Echo Dot can do and Alexa's knowledge will only continue to grow. ",
"Crystal Cooper","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is my new best friend. Ok, not really, but she does answer just about anything I throw at her, and she plays me music and turns my lights on and off. It's like having the smartest butler ever working for you. Want to feel instantly pampered? Get a compatible outlet plug, and have Alexa turn your bedroom lamp on/off every morning/night. It's posh, trust me.    I'm impressed with the mic range - I can talk to her from other rooms without issues. Every once in a while, she tries to answer a question from the TV, but then we just laugh and go back to drinking wine.    I really do like the Echo - it's small, can be portable (with accessories), answers those &#34;who was it that starred in Perfect Strangers&#34; questions that pop up, and can help you substitute eggs in a recipe in a pinch.

"Anakalia - Red Herring","January 13, 2017 ",4.0,"My whole family has been enjoying having Alexa around.  We're constantly asking her questions.  Some helpful and some not so helpful to some that are unknown or that she can't answer or understand.  I'm sure she'll get better and better with updates in time.    From homework, to cooking, to everyday life, traffic, stores, weather, music and silliness, we've been able to turn to her for some help and entertainment.  We've uploaded some of the &#34;skills&#34; but can't seem to remember what they're all called to access them so they're not used very often.    There's been a few times that she doesn't perk up when we talk to her but other than that, even with a Bluetooth speaker not too far away, she usually hears us over some loud music.    We're planning on getting a smart hub or some other add ons to work with her but for now, she is low key and takes up minimal space.    I am still debating whether or not to get a few more.  I would love one in my room and I know a couple of people who would like one under the Christmas tree. ",

Highboost145,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I ordered the Echo Dot after receiving Echo as a Christmas present.  Now that I have had time to look at all the functionalities, here is my input.  Hopefully the folks at Amazon Echo team will read this and make the following feature improvements.  1. Lack of equalizer (bass/mid/treble are all absent):  Echo line of speakers had 2 years of product maturity time.  I would imagine this equalizer function can be added with &#34;skills&#34; or software update.  2. &#34;Skills?!&#34;:  If you watch Google Home video, the device will literally Google everything for you.  Instead, for Echo devices, you have to add &#34;skills&#34; to enhance its functionality.  ....What???  I was hoping that devices like Echo will already come with all the common skills.  3. It can't Google: If you ask Alexa if she can Google things, she will tell you she can Bing things for you.  OK, so why can't she give me a meatloaf recipe, if she can connect to Bing?  And she can look up Wikipedia?  I don't really care for that.  Amazon, please make your own search engine, or fine-tune Bing search capability.  If this device can provide all the answers to our questions via Google or Bing, it would be a worthy competitor to Google Home.    Now that I got the negatives out of the way, I do think Echo still has the upperhand when it comes to connected home.  Recently, I purchased TP Link smart switch and connected my lamp.  Now with the verbal command, I can have Alexa turn on/off lights in my bedroom.  I also connected my Echo Dot to my home sound system by bluetooth.  My next connected home experience will be thermostat.  Overall, Echo is a product that is already matured, but there is still room for tons of improvements.  I really wish that the folks at Amazon will make those updates and make this product very competitive to Google Home. ",

Finally, I change the Wifi network name on our router and through process of elimination discovered that the echo was sucking our data dry. Supposedly, it only uses a minimal amount of data when in idle mode. This is simply not true. ",

You can ask about the weather, the time, the latest news, set an alarm, set a timer, ask a question of Wikipedia, ask what song or singer is currently on, pause, play, stop, change volume, ask how to spell something, she tells jokes and plays 20 Questions or Jeopardy...the list goes on and on and it's all done just with your voice.

"Tech Guy from IL","April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"This is really an amazing gadget and I'm finding a lot of good uses for mine. In the bedroom it is handy because you can ask Alexa the time or the weather at any time of the night without having to get out of bed or turn on a light. It also plays a wide variety of music. I use it to stream classical music from my favorite classical station. The sound is actually pretty good (in mono) right out of the disc if you are listening at low levels in a quiet room or at your desk at the office. Plug in a good pair of headphones and you'll get great sound in stereo. Sometimes I connect it to my stereo system and listen that way. With the dearth of good programming on local radio these days, having the ability to pick up stations from other areas on the Internet is really nice. This might be the best sounding and easiest to use Internet radio currently available, especially for the price. No complicated user interface to deal with. You just say &#34;Alexa, play (insert name of station) from Tune-In&#34; and you are set. ",
"S. Oake","April 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I don't review very often but felt compelled to do so with this item. I bought two of these the day they were released. One has worked flawlessly. Its twin, not so much and it has gotten progressively worse. It finally got to the point where the dot was done more than up so I called customer service. We went through the script, resetting everything and finally, the customer rep escalated my case. When I got the next level rep, my dot had started its working correctly cycle, so we disconnected. No sooner had we ended the call did the dot stop working again. Called back to customer service and the first rep decided to begin the reading of the script. I put a stop to that foolishness right away and told him to immediately escalate the case. The new rep determined that it was indeed a failing dot and then informed me that the dot 2nd generation only had a 3-month warranty and I would need to pay another $50 for a replacement (1st generation had a 1-year warranty). I had spent 1.5 hrs total this afternoon with customer support reps to find out that this device has one of the crappiest warranties in electronics! I hit the roof. I told them they either replace this piece of junk that has their name on it, or they cancel my prime membership. Their call. There was no third option. The new dot is in the mail, and a return label is sitting in my email waiting to be printed out.  The only reason this got a 2 star was the other dot I bought has worked flawlessly since day one.

UPDATE:  Now that I have had this device for over two months I still like it, BUT it has yet to answer even one of my questions.  I hate the fact that Amazon decided to use BING...who thought that was a good idea ?  The fact that Alexa can not give me answers to my inquiries is enough to make me want to check out Google Home.

Chad,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"First off, you will need the speaker so buy it. I wanted to Y this off with an adapter and run both my computer and this through the same speakers, but that didn't work so I ended up buying speakers. The other issue I have is that the microphones don't seem to pick up quite as well as my Echo. Still great mind you, but I notice that several times I've had to speak up. But with Echo I don't get that.    The main flaw with Alexa continues to be its reliance on Bing as its search engine. Amazon really needs to either create its own search algorithm for Alexa, switch to Google, or at the very least allow customers (the ones that are always right) to pick which of the two they want. I've performed experiments where I've asked Alexa and not gotten an answer then used OK Google with the same keywords and gotten exactly what I wanted. A perfect example was last night. I asked when the polls closed in my state. I named the state. Alexa couldn't tell me but instead said to go to the link that it placed in my app...well...first off...that's no good because I'm asking Echo and not my phone. When I did grab my phone and asked OK Google the exact question it gave me the answer I was looking for without any issues. I'm tired of Alexa either not knowing or putting a link in the app. I can tell you now I've never, not one single time, looked at that link in the app because I don't have it with me. The entire idea of a voice activated friend in every room is to get answers whenever and wherever you want. I don't want to carry my phone around the house with me.    All that said, I still enjoy having this device. I own Echo, this echo dot, and another will arrive this afternoon (literally). So I'm not knocking the product entirely. It's massively expandable using IFTT and skills but it's core function, that of an assistant, lacks and will lack until they get better search. ",

It doesn't matter the light switch is next to your head or the stereo/ TV remote is right in your hand.

At times it really does not understand me unless I stop and speak slow and close to it. It was having that problem for a solid 10mins yesterday, but after 10mins it was cool again. It seems to go haywire at times like that but not for long at all. And not that often.    I do have some problems staying connected when doing the voice training. For some reason the voice traing seems super messed up for me right now. You got thru 25 commands and for me pretty much every other command it would lose connection. Took almost 20mins to get thru the 25 commands.    It is awesome tho don't get me wrong here, i just wanted to point out it's flaws....And that is all of them :) Not too bad. and it is always improving and updating. This thing is awesome for playing my music, and pretty much just being my personal B****! :) The alarm is something I LOVE! I hate rolling out of bed and messing with my phone. Now I say &#34;Alexa STOP&#34; That's it :) The built in speaker is pretty good for a small apt. I love in a 1 bedroom apt. and it cranks. I still have it hooked up to my own speaker since its an awesome speaker I have. The built in speaker is more than enough tho for an alarm clock, timer, and music in a small apt. I also love being able to hear NFL scores so easy. &#34;Alexa, score of Denver game?&#34; Boom! It's a lot of fun.    There is a lot of stuff this thing can do. There is sooo many list of features out there that I am not going to go into that. This thing is great for someone who does a lot of multitasking. It has made my life a lot easier working from home. I would recommend it for the $50 price tag easy. It is a lot of fun to just mess around with as well. If you are looking at this and the $180 echo. There is no decision to be made. Go with this $50 echo, do not go for the Expensive one with a better speaker. You can get a better speaker way cheaper.    It does need some work, and they're doing a great job moving it along the track. I expect when the Google thing comes out it will push Amazon even more and in a years time this Echo Dot could be really, really epic for the price. ",
scummins89,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"This device is more or less a novelty period when asking questions Alexa cannot answer most things. It is difficult to get the device to work properly. I find using anything as far as a search text deep explanation and you have to be very specific to get the answers that you want. I would definitely not recommend this device until Amazon can come up with something better. I was highly disappointed and all levels. However the speaker was above average from what I could tell it surpassed my expectations. The design is also very nice I like the size and color. ",
"Janet Mac","October 24, 2016 ",4.0,"Thank you for making Alexis more affordable by offering the Dot as an option.  I haven't used it yet with a Bluetooth speaker, but I plan to.  Speaker is clear enough, but I would want to use a better speaker for music.  Paired with the Phillips Hue light bulbs, and the TP-Link smart plug, I don't have to go down stairs to turn on or off lights.  I love the convenience.  I also use it to get movie times at my favorite theater without turning on my computer or my smart phone. ",
Danny,"April 9, 2017 ",2.0,"For the price (especially the black friday price of $40) this is a great deal. I still use my original echo that I got about a year ago at least a few times a week, and I just bought two dots to play music in the shower and set alarms in my bedroom.    Since I live in an apartment often more than one echo hears me, but it's been working seamlessly that only the one closest to me (or that I am speaking in the direction of) replies.    If anyone from Amazon reads this, the feature I REALLY WANT is to give fire tv commands to my echo, e.g. &#34;play Westworld in the living room&#34;, &#34;pause the show&#34;, etc. I'm really hoping they add this ability soon, as well as other device coordination features like playing the same song on multiple echoes in multiple rooms.    A couple of other notes that might be useful for people:    - I bought the white echo Dot, but the usb cord and usb outlet adapter are black. Feels like Amazon got lazy here, why can't you make those in white too? I took away a star for this combined with the fact that it doesn't interface with the Fire TV at all.    - the speaker is good, for music it's honestly barely noticeable that it's a little worse in the lower-mid ranges than the regular echo. Where I actually notice it more is in Alexa's voice, it's just not quite as full sounding as the regular echo's voice. I was surprised that this is what stood out to me, but it almost sounds like a different person which was strange the first few times I used it.    - The volume on the dot is also good, at max volume it's probably about the same as the original echo at 8, which is higher than I ever set it.    - the usb outlet adapter is about 2 inches deep, which is bigger than I've seen in other electronic products. About twice as deep as the iphone usb wall adapter, I assume it's drawing more current and they aren't compatible but I haven't checked. On the upside, it's a standard 2-prong size, so it can plug into one of the middle spaces in a power strip and only take up one space. I guess they optimized for power strip usage instead of being able to plug it in behind furniture up against the wall. ",
"Bev Martin","December 12, 2016 ",5.0,"I purchased several of these on prime day when you could buy 4 (or was it 5) and get one free.  I now have an Echo in the main living area, a Dot in the bedroom, and a Dot in my craft room.  The others were great Christmas gifts.  The Dot works identical to the Echo except it has a much smaller speaker.  It can be connected to a blue tooth speaker, or in the case of my craft room, I have an expansive set of Bose speakers and CD player/changer (I guess it is getting a little old).  I have the Dot plugged into the Bose speakers and the sound is great. The Dot is much smaller than the Echo so in many circumstances it would be preferred over the Echo as it doesn't take up much space.  We love our Alexa(s) ",
"Allen F","November 27, 2016 ",4.0,"1. I have constant connectivity problems in which the Echo Dot, while it remains connected to the internet, somehow becomes invisible to my phone and tablet. Somehow this manages to mess up my Spotify account. It took a while, but I finally figured out that I could fix this by doing a complete reset on the Echo Dot. Now, I get to do that about once a day.  2. Speech recognition lags far behind Google and even Apple. Blows my karma on a regular basis by playing heavy metal when I asked for Rachmaninov's Vocalise. Pitiful.  3. There are thousands of so-called &#34;skills&#34;, or 3rd-party apps. They are uniformly useless. Do you really want a machine that tells you jokes? ",
"Michael Bingham-Hawk","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I would theoretically like this device, however, we discovered the hard way that it eats a ton of internet data. Our only option for internet is Hughes Satellite and we have a monthly data cap of 50gb a month. We were forced to purchase multiple data add ons. I would not figure out what was eating the data. Finally, I change the Wifi network name on our router and through process of elimination discovered that the echo was sucking our data dry. Supposedly, it only uses a minimal amount of data when in idle mode. This is simply not true. ",
"Amazon Customer Elicia","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I wish it had a dictionary.  The &#34;word of the day&#34; is insufficient. It doesn't understand everything but hope it learns soon.

Leedoh,"February 28, 2017 ",2.0,"Very easy to use and setup to work with other items in the house.  Within 10-minutes of turning it on I had it working with our Nest Home thermostat and Lutron Caseta lights.  Once I get our AVR setup I will also sync it with the Harmony remote to be able to control the TV/AVR through the Dot.    The kids love it from asking various questions to using the timer for study activities.  It also helps to speak more clearly.    We are exploring other skills like lists to be able to further use it.    One thing that we wished it had was the ability to sync to iCalendar as it only looks like it supports Outlook and google calendar.  I would guess though that it is probably only a matter of time before that skill is there. ",
"boB Gudgel","November 23, 2016 ",4.0,"I really like this product.  My big issue is that it is capable of SO much more !  I do believe my problem is that I do not know HOW to ask it questions properly.  I was able to have Alexa do some math as well but I am sure it can do way more if only there was an advanced &#34;how to&#34; guide to form questions properly for more complicated concepts.  I know that the server software will get better and better over time...  Also, it is nice that one can develop apps to make Alexa do more neat things.  I bought a second DOT as well as the Google Home because neither one by itself gives me the whole shebang.  If I had to choose though, I think I would choose the DOT over Google Home and NOT because it is less than 1/2 the price.  It's too bad that Amazon and Google don't like each other and Alexa won't use Google to search the web.  Works very well in spite of not doing that though. ",
"Amanda Garrison","March 23, 2017 ",5.0,"I just received this yesterday and I love it. Within an hour I had the Dot installed and the app installed and Dot connected and playing my Amazon Prime Music (I think I will upgrade to the Unlimited for the Dot, since there were songs that were that far off the beaten path that Prime Music could/would not play). Also it took me 10 minutes to install the Harmony skills for Alexa and I was operating my Harmony Hub connected equipment. I am working on getting Alexa integrated with my Homeseer HS3 soon.  I will say it is worth the time to do the voice recognition set up.  It has its limitations,  but adds convenience.  I am sure the skills and functionality will improve as time goes on. ",
Cari,"March 1, 2017 ",4.0,"I've had the larger Echo since they did the early pre-sale for Prime members years ago and love it. I got the Echo dot for my mother (late 50's but frustratingly bad with new technology) for Christmas this year. I wasn't sure if she would like/use it enough to justify getting her the bigger Alexa so I thought the dot would be a good intro. She loves it so far! I did help her set it up and show her some neat tricks, but she's been able to figure it out much more than I expected. Luckily the place that we decided to set it up in her house is near her Samsung TV soundbar so we were able to hook it up to that so it would be louder when she wants to listen to music. Her echo is about 10-15 feet from the kitchen and the Echo dot can still pick up her voice from that far when she tells Alexa to add something to her shopping list or start a timer (one of my favorite things Alexa does). I showed her some of the neat Smart home capabilities and ordered her a few TP-Link Smart Plugs because she had the old school light timers on her lamps in the living room. I left home after xmas before the plugs arrived and called her a couple days later to see if she figured out how to set up her new smart plugs and link them to Alexa and she said she had already figured it out herself! Without even calling me!! Groundbreaking.    Anyways, I think the Echo dot makes a great gift and works wonderfully as long as you don't expect it to be a full-size speaker like the regular Echo. It's easy to hook up to other speakers via headphone jack or Bluetooth, and otherwise has the same capabilities as the larger Alexa does. Since seeing the dot in my moms house, I've considered getting one for the second floor of my house since my Echo is on the first. ",
vacuumtubejazzpro,"March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"There's not much I can add that hasn't been said before, since the Echo Dot is constantly being improved, and anything I say today could be wrong tomorrow.  Mine has been especially poor for movie theater information, but I like it a lot for weather, news, radio, podcasts, and encyclopedia-type questions.  It's even really nice for background music, and seems to have nearly all albums available, including even the Beatles and Stones catalog. The sound quality of the internal speaker is hard to describe, but it's somewhere between, say, a cell phone's speakerphone and a decent Bluetooth speaker or table radio.  There's no bass at all, and little sparkle to the high frequencies, but within its limits, it presents a smooth, un-distorted sound that might exceed your expectations.  The 1/8&#34; headphone jack enables me to connected the Dot to my primary stereo system or to plug in my Shure studio monitor headphones.  It sounds great with either -- or at least as good as 256Kb/sec compressed audio can sound.  If I could add just one feature, the Dot is crying out for cell phone integration.  How cool would it be to be able to announce &#34;Alexa, Call Lilly&#34;, and be able to walk around your home hands-free while talking to your friend (as long as she's not named Alexa).  Or to have Alexa announce, &#34;Incoming call from Donald, would you like to accept?&#34; (hint, don't take the call). ",
"Old Radio Guy","March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"Fun for entertainment, but nothing more. Timer and alarm functions require an Internet connection, so if it loses connection and you had an important alarm or timer set, forget it. I have 240 mbps Internet with an Arris 1682g dual-band (AC standard) wireless router, 15 feet from Alexa. When we ask her a question sometimes an orange light appears and she says &#34;Sorry, there's no Internet connect&#34;, even though the app says she's connected. Today I asked her to set a 10-minute timer. When the timer went off, she wouldn't cancel it. When I asked her if she knew what &#34;stop&#34; meant, she gave me 4 definitions of stop. I had to unplug her for 15 seconds to cancel the alarm. With such spotty performance, I see a Warranty return sometime in her near future. ",
Lifesavr,"December 8, 2016 ",4.0,"I purchased this Echo Dot for a friend to help her experience AI for the first time.  This worked well and was easy to install.  The speaker in it is fair, but that is what it suppose to be.  I easily connected it to a higher quality bluetooth speaker and that made it sound very nice.  This provides a very inexpensive way of starting out with an AI in one's home.  I would surely purchase this item again.  I have also purchased recently the Google Home AI and surely they are different items aimed at satisfying the user needs in different ways.  The one thing I can say about the Google Home so far is that the speaker sucks.  The full Echo has much better sound quality.  I am truly excited to see how this addiction to the home AI experience affects the future of home AI experiences. ",
"I. M. Flaud","March 8, 2017 ",2.0,"The speaker is tinny by comparison with the Amazon Echo. However, the sound through the 3.5mm jack to a pair of FOSTEX monitor speakers is more than adequate to my failing ears.    I purchased an echo and a dot to keep me company in different rooms of the apartment. It will read some Kindle books in its synthesized voice, as well as Audible audio books. Have just begun experimenting with Wemo wifi sockets to control lights. Now that I can say, &#34;Alexa, living room on!,&#34; and &#34;Alexa, lights off!&#34; I'm hooked. ",
arjayess,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I've been waiting for Amazon to streamline the echo system and get a lower price option, and the 2nd generation dot is the answer.  I've place four of them at strategic places in my home.  It's great to be able to get the day's schedule, play music, do some internet searches, and control my connected thermostat remotely.  Speech recognition is very powerful and quite accurate, especially compared to the technology just a few ars back.  The sound is also very adequate for such a small device but the well programmed bluetooth feature connects automatically to my soundbar when it is turned on.  I also found the setup to be easy, especially compared to some other wifi connected devices I've installed.  This is a must have for Amazon Prime members, giving access to the huge prime music library. ",
Mia,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"OH, Alexa....Oh my.  I had to take you with me while I&#34;m pet-sitting.  I couldn't leave you behind. I've only had you for about 10 days, and yes, I'm afraid I'm getting addicted.  Is the Dot-Anonymous group I could join?  I ask her (you almost can't say &#34;it&#34; which is really weird) about the weather, to set a timer, play music (which is nice because if you are on a Prime Music station, you can say &#34;I don't like this&#34; or &#34;Thumbs down&#34; as well as &#34;I like this,&#34; or &#34;Thumbs up.&#34;  I haven't set up lists or anything like that.  The only reason the Dot 2nd Gen gets a 4 star review from me is she will not connect to either of my already purchased Bluetooth speaker, which is annoying as all get out.  And the app is pretty wonky and not terribly user-friendly and I'm not an idiot or a newbie. I would also like the ability to set different tones for a timer and an alarm.  Really, do I want to wake up to &#34;beepbeep&#34; like an oven time.  Bleech.  It's pretty cool, useful little device. They are supposed to come out with a battery base so you can take her from room to room.  I did call customer service and get ahold of someone in Echo support. He told me that &#34;they are working on the Bluetooth connectivity issue.&#34; Yeah, sure.  Right now, the Dot will onl  But you could y connect to the speakers for sale with her.

The limitations are frustrating, but it will come. . . it will come.  For now, it is indeed a useful device for things like telling me my calendar entries for the day, or the temperature outside, or for just playing a little background music.  Amusing when a TV add says &#34;Alexa&#34; (or in a show, as has happened), and the device lights up all eager to serve . ..  Ha ha!

JDThird,"November 6, 2016 ",4.0,"I was one of the earlier adopters of the Amazon Echo, and loved it since day one.  So when the first gen dot came out, I snagged one.    Loved it, although the speakers weren't nearly as good.  But what I didn't like was that if I was between the two (Echo in the great room, dot in my bedroom), they'd BOTH respond.    Not a big deal when you're checking the weather, but annoying when you're creating a shopping list, and dangerous when you order something.    This one was supposed to help resolve that issue, which was the only reason I bought it.  I liked the old one's form better, and the ring for volume is MUCH nicer than the buttons.  But I wasn't going to lose sleep, since once it's set I usually never adjust the volume of the dot, and if it really did keep from doubling up things, it'd be worth the loss of the ring.    And it works flawlessly.    Even when I first set it up, I had it about 5 feet from the Echo, and my testing, only one would answer.  EVERY... SINGLE... TIME...    I could NEVER get that to work with the old Gen 1 dot.    Flawless.  Now regardless of where I am in the house, even if both hear me, only one responds.    LOVE that.    So they did a great job with the enhancements in functionality on the Gen 2 dot. ",

Put your location in it to include street address, as well as city and state.  Otherwise, if you ask it for weather or traffic conditions, it will give you Tucson, Arizona, which I believe is the default location.  At least on mine it was.

"Joseph Knight","April 1, 2017 ",2.0,"I love that you can use it independently or paired with a speaker of your own choosing. I listen to podcasts and older radio programs a lot, so the speaker quality built in doesn't have to be amazing. It does the job, and I can hear and enjoy the things I do listen to. And, if it ever becomes an issue, I can connect it to my own stereo, solving the problem.    My complaint rests in the refusal of each company to realize the circumstances in which people get these things. They're most likely given as gifts, which means that nobody really gets to choose which one they get. I have a Prime subscription. I also happen to subscribe to Google Play services. I can't access any of their content through the device. That's maddening. I realize they're competing products and services, but come on. Somebody gave it to me as a Christmas present, and I can't choose my gifts. This is the ONE issue I've come across so far. It's only one problem, but it's a pretty big freakin' problem.    If we want to get down to the heart of the matter, I can do everything on the Google Home that I can do with the Dot, and more. The only thing keeping me from getting one is the price. If Google were to release a similar product at a similar price, as of now I would have to make the jump. ",
"A. Kim","December 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I've owned the full-sized Amazon Echo for about a year, and have been generally happy with the device, so decided I would give the new Echo Dot (2nd Generation) a try in my office.  Although I knew not to expect great sound quality from the small built-in speaker in the Echo Dot, I still found the sound quality and levels disappointing.  No problem though, I thought, as I have a Bose Soundlink Mini bluetooth speaker (the first generation Soundlink, as opposed to the Sounlink II) available to use with the Echo Dot.  I had no problems pairing the Soundlink with the Echo Dot, and was able to enjoy good sound quality from the Soundlink when paired with the Echo Dot for playing various Amazon Prime music stations.  However, I have since discovered a design flaw/oversight that dramatically decreases the usefulness of the Echo Dot for my arrangement.  If I ask Alexa to stop playing music (in order to take a call, for example), the bluetooth connection with the Soundlink will eventually time out because the Soundlink will power off if nothing is playing after a period of time (maybe 15-20 minutes).  When this happens, the Echo Dot automatically resumes playing music through its built-in speaker, even though my last command to the Echo Dot was to stop playing music about 15-20 minutes earlier.  This obviously is bothersome (and embarrassing) when I'm in the middle of a work call, and all of a sudden the Echo Dot starts playing music right next to me.  This also happens whenever I manually power off the Soundlink speaker while it's connected via bluetooth to the Echo Dot.  I can't understand why the Echo Dot would be programmed to restart playing music whenever an external bluetooth speaker connection is terminated, even though nothing is playing when the disconnection occurs.  Perhaps my Echo Dot is defective, but I suspect this is just a bad design flaw/oversight.  I've since decided to return the Echo Dot, and just purchase another full size Amazon Echo for use in my office, and skip the whole bluetooth speaker connection problem. ",

So far (and I've only had it one day) I've found some great playlists and got the nap of my life to a &#34;sleep music&#34; playlist, set alarms and reminders and listened to my favourite radio station from back home in London.

Jeff,"December 15, 2016 ",3.0,"LOOOOOOOVE my Dots! I'm really getting used to talking to Alexa, getting helpful information, turning off and on music, lights, etc.    I have two desires in order to get to 5 stars:    1) Alexa confuses profiles if two Amazon Household members each have separate Amazon Prime accounts. My wife and I have separate Amazon accounts. However, when registered in Alexa as a household, she can't tell one calendar from another. This makes no sense to me, since each registered email address has its own GMail calendar, but according to Amazon Support, Alexa can't distinguish them if we have separate Amazon accounts. The result is she can only read from one calendar, regardless of which profile she's set to. It's a minor annoyance, but makes the calendar connection useless unless we close one of our Amazon accounts.    2) Alexa has a bit of trouble distinguishing Smart Home routines. For example, if you have 2 Smart Home routines called &#34;Enter Bedroom&#34; and &#34;Leave Bedroom&#34;, she always has to ask which one you really want, even though &#34;Enter&#34; and &#34;Leave&#34; sound nothing alike. If you remove the word &#34;Bedroom&#34; from both routines, then she's fine, which would be an option if I only had one room in my house! ",

Edwin,"November 29, 2016 ",5.0,"Man, I don't know what life was like before we got Alexa.  She makes our life easy.  She turns on and off all of our lights, our furnace, air conditioner, she even sets and changes the mood lights in our bedroom.  She is now my alarm clock, she plays music, and I used her a lot for new words as my talking dictionary.    Remember the days where you have to turn on your computer and Google something?  Well, now you can ask Alexa even if you just woke up from your bed like as her &#34;Alexa, what time is it?&#34;  You can even set an alarm for Alexa to wake you up in half an hour, or even play your favorite music.  I think what I like most about Alexa is that she has made my life that much easier especially when my hands are tied and I don't have a set of hands to turn on the lights, she can do that for me with a &#34;say a command!&#34;  I highly recommend you get one and once you do, you don't look back!!

"Helen Mayer","November 15, 2016 ",5.0,"I use it all the time to ask Alexa for the weather, the news, to play music, set a timer so I only spend so much time getting ready to go out...but the best reason, and the reason I ordered another for a different room,was for the My Buddy App. I am in a wheelchair, and occasionally have a fall. I have always been able to get up again, but if one day I can't, I can ask Alexa to alert one or all of the contacts I put into Ask My Buddy. Your contact(s) will be alerted by phone and by text that you need assistance. The service is free, but you can make a donation. ",
Blueviolet59,"November 29, 2016 ",5.0,"Like many people, I've been waiting for the whiz gadgets of the Jetsons and Star Trek to make it to my house. Well, this is the start!    I bought the Echo Dot because the price had dropped and we were looking for a way to control our lights when we're out of town...with an eye to adding other security features. The Dot not only works well at controlling appliances, but it also is a hoot for getting answers about other things. The weather, my upcoming schedule, the grocery list, who was Aaron Burr. She also tells jokes!    It was very easy to set up (you'll need wifi and your wifi password). We paired ours with the TP-Link Smart Plugs and have since been learning about the many things that Alexa can do. My husband thought it was a waste of money (geez, what's wrong with plugging the mechanical timers on the lights?), but has warmed up to the whole idea tremendously. Our next purchase will be replacement wall switches that can link to Alexa to control the ceiling fans and lights, and most likely a thermostat as well.    This would be a great gift to an older homeowner, especially someone with mobility issues, because it's all controlled by voice. ",
"Murl Harmon","March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"Know I say this having paid for the Echo Tap, you really only need to get the dot. It has a small speaker so no high definition sound, but I am not listening to music. I use this for information, checking my spelling, weather, and turning the lights on and off. I can sink up the Bluetooth speaker to it and get excellent sound for music and audio books (although for such a small speaker the dot does do OK) I was shocked that this does everything like the bigger Echo at 1/3 the cost. (yes minus the quality speaker) I really like this product and what it can do. ",
"Ashley B.","December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Great! Can do what the bigger one does (or so I hear) and we don't have any issues with the speaker being too quiet/not quality enough for what we're using it for. We use it for a variety of things but in a house with a 3-year old it is most often used as a kitchen, potty, or time-out timer- lol. We got it as a gift so I wouldn't have bought it myself just for that, but having a newborn on my hands it is so nice just to tell &#34;Alexa&#34; to play a song or start a timer for me. I'm sure with more time I will continue to learn how better to use the capabilities for further use. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 15, 2017 ",5.0,"I have two Echo dots and have them linked to several products in my house.  They are great, but one of them turns itself off randomly in the middle of an answer / function and reboots, often time several times in a row.  I am not sure why this happens and wish it would work properly!  When it is working I would highly recommend it if you can connect it to other products in your home and use it as a wireless &#34;controller&#34;!    Update: Customer service has been trying to help me work through this and while they have still not sorted it out completely that have been very helpful and I am confident that this will be resolved.

Frubbish,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This is one of those no-brainer tech gadgets that everyone should have, especially for the price.  The trickiest part of the Echo line is just getting in the habit of using it!  Is is so simple to setup and use, that it's a non-issue.  If you pick one up, i recommend actually reading the frequent emails that Amazon sends out that gives updates on the What's New with Alexa.  They are introducing new features all the time. ",

"M. Dembski","December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"Good first start. Good on dealing with Amazon but even there music integration is weak. Sometimes it plays just my music and sometimes prime. Voice recognition is good, not great. Google is better. When an internet search is required, performance is poor. Not sure if that Alexa or the Bing search engine but results are not very good. Alexa frequently appears to crash. Probably too many people using. Trying to get nearest restaurant bar etc is totally inaccurate. Locations are miles further away. No way to custumize TuneIn so frequently get wrong status. Does not get logic right unless you use exact wording. I have two and both drop the Bluetooth connection occasionally. It's not the speaker as it's rock solid to my phone. ",
"MommaCX3 ☀️","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"Great product. All the awesome features of Alexa minus the exceptional sound quality of the Echo. If you don't have an Echo you wouldn't know the sound isn't as good though (I don't think). We have the Dot in my son's room. He loves using it for weather updates, audiobooks, timers, various questions and music. We rely on our Echo for the most part for music but otherwise the Dot can't be beat, especially for the price. ",
Ash585,"November 2, 2016 ",3.0,"There are some great in-depth reviews already posted, but I mirror the general consensus that this is a great product. I purchased as a gift for someone that wants to easily stream music. This is very easy to use (set-up is simple via your smartphone) and so far no problems with Alexa recognizing music selections. One thing I haven't found mentioned in a review- If you're looking for 'pop' music, Alexa is fantastic at finding songs. If you're looking for 'classical,' or anything performed by specific orchestras or musicians, she's not as good at finding those yet. She'll find a version of Beethoven 6, but you might have a hard time asking for a specific orchestra playing it. ",
J4,"April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"Having Alexa is actually more useful than I thought it would be.  I bought one just to try out and see what it's like.  Having the ability to just ask a question without picking up a phone or device is great.  If you have a prime account and have amazon music it's even better, I find myself more often then not just asking Alexa to play a station or a song and because it's linked to my prime account the music plays without me having to go through my phone.  I was very surprised at how decent the speaker on the echo dot is, I was expecting a crappy small speaker that was really going to rely on connecting to a Bluetooth speaker or physical connection.  The device works really well as a standalone speaker for a decent size room.  I wouldn't trade in your nice speakers over it but if you have 2/3 dots around the house it actually works fine by itself.  I never would have foreseen myself buying multiple but after having one I can see the use for having one on each floor of my house, as a music player, as a device for asking the weather, asking questions, setting alarms, adding things to a list, making purchases, using it to control Alexa enabled devices.  It's definitely worth it for the price. ",
Chels,"November 25, 2016 ",5.0,"It doesn't get very loud but it works for a small room. I love that I can connect it to my phone and listen to my music, I can have Alexa change volume, pause, and switch songs all hands free. Sometimes it doesn't understand what you say so you have to try talking more clear, it doesn't understand kids very well. ",
"Billy B","December 16, 2016 ",4.0,"I was a very early adopter of the original Echo and wrote Amazon how they needed an Echo device that allowed Bluetooth OUT or wired audio OUT.  Yet I sat on this little gem without ordering one for a long time.  Finally pulled the trigger and am very glad I did.  Great device to hook up to your home audio system or Bluetooth speakers.  I have mine on a Bose Wave Radio in the Bedroom.  It's an amazing device that is my alarm clock, music and news source, and music entertainment.  It's simply amazing. ",
IMHO,"March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"This is an updated review.  My first Echo Dot was a failure, but the replacement is good.  My full size Echo has a better sound quality, but this little guy does the job and is small enough to sit in the kitchen and not get in the way! ***UPDATE*** I purchased the Bose Soundlink Mini 2 for my Echo Dot.  The sound is OK, HOWEVER, I also own a full size Echo and that sounds BETTER than the Echo Dot with the Bose Soundlink AND for less money!  That said, if you are focused on sound quality, it is my honest opinion that you would be better served with the full size Echo over the Dot with the Bose Mini 2.  Here is my initial review of the Echo:  I tried to get a video of this, but for some reason it won't load.  I'll try again later.  The dot works similar to the full size echo, although the sound quality is not as good.  The reason for two stars is that the dot frequently drops the internet connection and also seems to have a defective processing chip or something because when I leave it alone for more than half an hour and then speak to it, the response is a red ring and the comment of &#34;I'm having trouble understanding right now, please try again later&#34;.  Later will only happen if I unplug it and re-plug it in again.  I called technical support, and they are sending a replacement so I'll review my replacement and  update this review as this unfolds.  It is worth mention that I LOVE my full size Echo, and am still hopeful that the Dot will work. ",
"The Helpful Dad","October 25, 2016 ",5.0,"Overall we're impressed. The main reason I got it was to attach it to my existing stereo in order to stream music on zone 2 for my patio/bedroom/bath. I was just about to buy a Sonos Connect to do this (for over $300) but decided to try the Echo Dot first. I am so glad I did. The Echo does does a great job for this task - it connects to my stereo well and what's great is that Echo uses WIFI not bluetooth so the range to connect to it from your phone is much bigger. We can be on the opposite side of the house and use the phone to control Alexa and change the music.    Tip: I used an existing audio cable to attach to Echo Dot so you do not necessarily need to buy the extra audio cable if you already have one.  Tip: once you use voice control to activate Alexa to play music the first time, then you no longer need to keep using your voice to play music. You can just use the app on your phone and be in a different room. This is great. We can relax in the bedroom controlling Alexa while the Echo is in the living room.    The only thing I don't like is that there are minimal/almost no physical controls and the app is sometimes slow to use to control Alexa. ",
"Lisa Fite","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"*Alexa, play Jeopardy*  You know how you thought Siri was going to really revolutionize how you use your phone?  Then after a little while of asking her silly questions she just kind of became useless.  Well, Alexa (Dot) is like that.  After the fun of opening the box and setting *her* up, she just sort of becomes another thing on the counter or shelf.  Don't get me wrong, I like her, but she's just not that useful. I ask her about the weather and I enjoy playing Jeopardy every (week) day or having her play a song or two during dinner.  More often than not, I get frustrated because she can't do what I ask or I just plain forget she's there. ",
"H. Ramsey","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"This was a surprise Christmas gift and it turned out to be a very nice surprise! We had thought about purchasing it so the kids could ask it questions, but never seriously considered it. Then we received it gift.  Turns out it does a lot (a LOT) more than answer questions. The answering questions part is great, sometimes you have to rephrase it so Alexa understands what you are saying, but she does a good job answering 90% of the time.    She easily recognizes our voices. Even my 4 year old can trigger it most of the time. When there is a lot of noise in the background she can add a word or two, but she seems to be learning as you go and we have not tried the voice training with her yet (there are 6 of us in the house so a lot of background noise). The key seems to be learning how to say what you are asking. If you want a song then use the word &#34;play&#34; first, if you have a question then use the question word first, etc.    She does so much more than just answer questions. I love the news updates. I don't need to check my phone for top stories only to get distracted by the random junk that pops up with the news. You can choose the news channel (I saw BBC, NPR, CNN, Fox, and more offered). At the end of the top stories (goes about 5 minutes) she gives a weather update and forecast for your area. The update changes every hour so if you feel the need to get more news than go for it. Ask her if it is going to rain in the next hour, what the traffic is like for your commute, and more.    Playing whatever song/artist/station you want is a great way to listen to music. Want to hear a song - just ask.    The timer is useful. I used to grab my phone when I needed to set a timer, now I just ask Alexa. When the kids ask for tablet time or they need to do homework/reading time I can just ask Alexa to set the timer for me. This saves me going to my own tablet or phone (which I usually forget to do) and means the kids really get 15 minutes tablet time when I say they can rather than 45 minutes when I realize I forgot to set the timer.    She has so many skills that we have yet to try, but the ones we have are fun additions. There is a great game, magic door, that works like a choose your own adventure (complete with sound effects). The kids are currently in the middle of trying to find a wizard. You can pause the game and re-enter at any time. Alexa guesses what animal (or thing) you are thinking when you play 20 questions or the animal game. There is a bedtime story skill where she tells a random bedtime story using your child's name. After telling my 4 year old a princess story last night (using her name) she said &#34;now it is time for bed and no you can't have another glass of water&#34;. My daughter thought it was hilarious. It would be great for an elderly or bed-ridden person looking for something to talk to. It will also read audiobooks.    The kids love the joke feature (Alexa tell me a joke) and my husband likes trying to trip her up with random odd questions (What is the meaning of life, who's your daddy, who let the dogs out, etc). Ask her what her resolutions are or the highlights of the year. It is good for a laugh.    I haven't hooked her up to our thermostat yet and we don't have any smart lights/locks so I can't comment on that feature. I am seriously considering moving all my calendar stuff to google so she can plan my day for me. We put a code on ordering so the kids don't accidentally buy something (you can turn the feature off completely if you would rather), but you can still add things to lists when you think about them (then access that list in your amazon account).    Overall, great! I would even consider getting a few more (you could use it as an alarm clock plus extra features in a bedroom, to control things in your living room, this one is in our kitchen for lists/timers/etc).

All with the capability of being controlled over Wi-Fi with this little mechanism. I'm looking at upgrading to the Echo bad boy, but for the time being this thing is sweet and has so much potential for what I'm going to do. Will come in very handy around the house, being able to control my Thermostat or my lighting when I'm in a completely different room. Maybe having multiple of these around the house and centrally locate the Echo bad boy would help out. Need to look at getting a few Hubs set up so I can control Plex.

"Guerrilla Reader","March 28, 2017 ",2.0,"Review of: &#34;All-New Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,&#34; by Amazon.    The manufacturer specifications include: &#34;Echo Dot (2nd Generation) is a hands-free, voice-controlled device that uses Alexa to play music, control smart home devices, provide information, read the news, set alarms, and more.  Connects to speakers or headphones through Bluetooth or 3.5 mm stereo cable to play music from Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.  Controls lights, fans, switches, thermostats, garage doors, sprinklers, and more with compatible connected devices from WeMo, Philips Hue, Samsung SmartThings, Nest, ecobee, and others.  Hears you from across the room with 7 far-field microphones for hands-free control, even in noisy environments or while playing music.  Includes a built-in speaker so it can work on its own as a smart alarm clock in the bedroom, an assistant in the kitchen, or anywhere you might want a voice-controlled computer.  Always getting smarter and adding new features, plus thousands of skills like Uber, Domino's, and more.  Amazon Echo is not required to use Echo Dot.&#34;    The Echo Dot is a really cool limited personal assistant.  It sets up in minutes and begins to work immediately thereafter.  Upon summoning Alexa I was able to subscribe to Prime Music with access to millions of songs; get immediate current weather and moon phase; create a running shopping list; and re-order products from my Amazon order list. Although I am not familiar with all of the features that the Echo Dot allows, one feature that really impresses me is the interactive process with Alexa and the (her) smooth voice.  I just asked Alexa to sync up with my Kindle and she began to read the last book I purchased.  Her voice is incredibly human-like with proper rate of speech, phrasing, inflection, intensity, syntax, and voice stress.  There is little tinny robotic sound, if any.  What an incredible advancement over previous technology used in the Kindle!  I enjoy asking Alexa any multitude of questions which usually she will answer.  Alexa answers my questions on history, facts, etc. and of course will tell a joke on demand.  This is a cool and fun device which I described to my family as a limited personal assistant.  I will update this review as time progresses.  The Echo Dot in terms of a speaker will easily fill an average room with clear sound.  Obviously there is no thumping bass, etc. but the sound is pretty remarkable from such a small device.  I just downloaded the Alexa App onto my iPhone to help me work the unit as well.  Another feature is that Alexa responds immediately.  When I command Alexa to stop the music the unit goes silent as I am finishing the command.  It is amazing.  At this point I would recommend the Echo Dot to anyone and rate it at five stars for a competitive price and lots of features.  I am sure that more will be added each year.  Well done! ",
"Clark Hinckley","March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"As advertised. Small and unobtrusive, works well, connects easily and seamlessly to bluetooth speakers. In reality, there are still only a relatively limited number of truly useful things you do with Alexa unless you are creating an extensive automated home - multiple lights, various living conditions, locks, AV, etc., all with a large price and complex set up. Does not have as many answers to random (but interesting) questions as Siri (which can also answer visually on your phone or iPad screen). But this is a good start, fun to use, and has generally set the standard for simplicity and seamless operation. ",
KMMR,"December 27, 2016 ",5.0,"I love this thing! It is a bit weird to have these types of electronics always doing things in my home but I have come to really enjoy my Echo. I ask Alexa a ton of questions. I love the games she will play and stories she tells. My only complaint is that Alexa needs more personality, like the Google Home unit has (my folks have that one so I get to play with both). Other than that, the Echo rocks. I have it hooked up to my Smart Home system which allows me to use voice commands on certain functions of my house, which is totally awesome. ",
"Real Story","March 3, 2017 ",4.0,"I've been using Siri and Cortana faithfully. I'm probably one of the few prople that use them all day everyday. So, I thought the dot would round out my usage by adding them where the other assistants were not. I found Alexa couldn't even tell me how many kilobytes to a megabyte. I have a slew of questions that show on the app correctly but sadly she only answered very few. I have 30 days with BestBuy to return them, so I'll give it a few more tries but it's not looking so good. ",

I performed a hard-reset which got it working for a while longer, then the issue has occurred a few times since. I contacted Amazon about the issue, but was told there was nothing they could do about it since it's out of warranty. This is truly the reason for my low-star rating. ",
"K. Biegler","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Well what can you say? Ok, One day I told Alexa that, 'I loved her' ... she answered back ... 'That's nice, Thank You' ... so I guess we're going to only be 'just friends' :-D    It's a pretty nice small device, if you are looking for audiophile fantastic ... no ... but for the nightstand and controlling Nest and hopefully lights as well as streaming music it's a pretty nice addition to the home. Looking forward to the new battery pack when it arrives and hopefully they are on schedule with teaching her to control my Sonos for now though streaming radio stations from around the country via the web or Pandora we are loving it ... getting weather, news briefs and setting alarms with simple voice commands is pretty nice.

"Clark Wilson","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"This 2nd gen Dot is our third Echo device.  We started with the original Echo and loved it.  The original seems the best of the three.  I have it in the home office.  We followed up with a 1st gen Dot when they became available and set it up with a bluetooth speaker in our bedroom.  The third we placed in our kitchen.    The first Echo seems most responsive.  It immediately answers questions and requests and the speaker is actually quite good.  However, I think it might be location and placement.  It sits on the counter and there are few ambient noises around.    The second in our bedroom works fairly well. We probably use it the most.  The speaker seems a little &#34;tinny&#34;. We hooked it up to a small bluetooth speaker and it does well.  My wife relocated it to the top of a display cabinet so Alexa struggles to hear there a bit.    Our newest addition is the 2nd gen Dot and it was placed in the kitchen.  We have been slower to adopt it to kitchen tasks only because it is habit to set timers and such in there manually.  Adding items to the shopping list is really cool.  If they can add a feature to allow multiple items at a time it would be great.  We do use it a lot for music, internet radio and news etc.  The kitchen Dot does struggle a little with ambient sound and I have moved it around the kitchen to get better responses.    None of the Dots conflict with the other and setup for all were very easy.    We have just started collecting Alexa enabled outlets and have started automating some lighting.  We have a Wemo and now a handful of TP Link to experiment with.  All fairly easy to install.    I plan to purchase one more Dot for my garage workshop.  I want to use it to automate some workshop and yard lighting as well as have hands free music etc available.  We will see how the noise there affects it. ",

My brother-in-law is a new gadget person and has everything but he didn't have this and he had not even seen it.  I couldn't have bought a better present for him.

She can't answer a lot of questions but she functions as a calculator, dictionary, timer, alarm clock, music streamer, and her skills are like apps on your phone and she has a few good ones. Overall, worth the price. Thanks Amazon, cool deal!    Surprisingly, her speaker is nice and smooth sounding, although there is practically no bass at all. There is clear midrange and highs are present so the music is enjoyable through her. The speaker is on the bottom, interestingly done, but if you sit her on the bed you can't hear her well. =) ",
"Matt [Eight-Six]","January 6, 2017 ",5.0,"We currently use two of these at home, and gave one to our parents to try out too.    Our home is host to products like WeMo, and Nest, and the Echo Dot effortlessly detects and and communicates with these smart devices well. I would like to see further support for some devices (I know Sonos is coming) but the sooner the better in my opinion. We also use Google Homes and while the Homes are nice, the Dot seems to be more on point with the devices it talks to.    On occasion Alexa will answer 'OK' and not execute the command given, making asking her twice to do the action a little bit of a nuisance. It's a small issue but likely a problem for that of the devices (like WeMo) that she attempts to talk to.    I also don't like how Amazon works with IFTTT. Having to setup 'trigger' is annoying when the competition will execute the command without saying 'sending that to IFTTT.' To me it makes it less awesome and seamless.    Example if using IFTTT: (I'm Home is the command for turning the lights/thermostat on)    &#34;Alexa Trigger I'm Home&#34; and she responds &#34;Sending that to IFTTT&#34;    Using the competition:    &#34;OK Google I'm home&#34; and hearing &#34;Welcome Home!&#34; is a much nicer experience.    Now it is fair to say that you can setup groups in the Alexa App, to do something similar (not using IFTTT), but the reason I mention this stuff is because some things will require support from IFTTT, and the way they work together (at the time of this review) is annoying.    I also recommend using an external speaker for her to communicate through. The added 3.5 aux audio jack was a nice inclusion for the Dot. I assume they knew this would be something people wanted and unlike the competitions sub-par speaker and no DIRECT audio out, I find this a nice thing to have. Both dots utilize a much better external speaker, and sit on top of said speakers. This adds to the better experience listening to music, and hearing her more clearly.    The sooner it supports my Sonos, the better. :)    I'd recommend this if you have interest in trying out home automation. It is great, with some minor set backs (likely just personal grievances subjective to my own tastes) ",

JerryP,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I am a techie that has been troubled in getting on board with the smart watches and voice everything. I grabbed a Dot (too cheap for the Echo). I am floored at the complexity yet usability of this thing. And was totally shocked on how decent it sounded. No it is not going to rattle the windows but I really expected it to be unusable for background music. It really has a decent sound so will not be adding speakers to it. I am just learning how to connect to a few gadgets and the vocabulary will take a little more work. But I really am impressed. Out of the many gadgets I have purchased - this one is staying put! Now I am on the hunt for more gadgets to interface with it! ",
GG,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"My husband and I love our Echo Dot. He got me the Dot for Christmas and we both enjoy having it in our place. We were pleasantly surprised because we didn't really have a lot of expectations for it (&#34;at the very least it's an alarm clock&#34;), but boy did it deliver. So far we use it for setting timers, alarms, adding events on calendars, ordering on Amazon, playing music (we have Spotify and Amazon Music), reading books (we both have Kindles with a shared library), playing audiobooks (I have an audible account), getting commute info, getting weather forecasts, asking for store hours, getting daily news updates (we customized our flash briefing to start with the &#34;saint of the day&#34;), answering random questions, and a couple other things. We connect it to a JBL Charge 3 speaker, but we use it on its own for the most part. We're currently looking into making our place a smart home, so we're definitely picking those that can be integrated with our Dot. All in all, we love it. Corresponds to our simple daily tasks and we just have fun with it. For $50, it's a great buy! ",
"iutaro girotto","December 13, 2016 ",5.0,"The Alexa dot is a godsend, i kept waiting for a black Friday discount since its release to get an echo, for 50$ this device is a steal, BUT, there is not much the device can do by itself, I use Alexa mostly for home automation, so I got a hue white kit(big mistake) and a blumoo(small mistake), the Phillips hue works GREAT! but only as long as you use hue bulbs, if you want third party bulbs STAY AWAY from Phillips hue!, the HUE whites are actually yellow, I dislike that color and that makes the room look old if you can understand what I mean, so I got the cree white 5000k, they are nice and white,so go for a wink or a Samsung smart things, they work way better, now to clarify you CAN add third party bulbs on hue from time to time but is really hard, and every other update they mess it up and it wont detect them again.    The blumoo only works for apple and not android so I had to borrow an old iPhone 4 that i have to keep always on in the house to make it work, wich bothers me to no end, but once you get it to work is awesome, turning on the AC, TV and Home theater 6 with a single voice command makes you feel like captain of a spaceship, if you can't get an IOS device with at least IOS7 i suggest you get anymote home, since its interface is better anyway.    the speaker is perfect for a bedroom, is just loud enough, is safe to say the echo is the best alarm clock on planet earth, I just say to Alexa at what time I want to be awake the next day and done, if you are a prime member it also comes with prime music which granted, doesn't have as many songs as Spotify is good enough, it can work with pandora and spotify as well if you are a member of those services, it's great for playing music, you can just ask her to play genre, author or specific song and thats it ",
"Charles S. Pickard","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I am an audiophile and am amazed at the good fidelity that can be obtained with the new Echo Dot II.  One of your reviewers suggested a direct cable connection to the speakers vs. Bluetooth is better.  I normally agree but can not hear any differnce using the Bose Mini Soundlink II speakers.  That combination far outperforms the larger Echo for fidelity. (I undrestand there will be a new Echo with improved speakers next year.)  Bluetooth has improved so much in the last 5 years I am beginning to ignore my collections of  CD's and LP's.    I am so impressed with the Echo Dot II that I will order 2-3 more.  The price is a steal for what it will do.  Setup and pairing is easy. The Alexa app. works with both the Echo and the Echo Dot.  The access to good music from several excellent sources makes it unecessary to search through my CD and LP collection.    If you have a decent pair of bluetooth speakers, I suggest pairing with the Echo Dot. It creates a great sound system.  Even alone the speaker in the Dot is OK. But for the price you can't do better.

"Amazon Customer","November 17, 2016 ",5.0,"Update: 3-11-17  Still like the dot, but it's not as reliable as the original echo's that I have.    Love the echo's so much that I have 2 echos and a dot! I use it for everything. Play music, use it for my lights, set timers, set lighting routines, check my commute. The list goes on and on. ",
Melanie,"December 21, 2016 ",5.0,"The only con was there not many instructions in the box,  so several people aren't aware that some skills need to be enabled ( which can be done with a simple voice command Alexa enable x skill ). Additionally, Alexa will function much more efficiently if you do voice training found in your Alexa app settings This helps her learn your particular speech patterns.  It only takes a few min and greatly improved her accuracy with my cadence.  I'm flooored by this device. My family loves it and cannot imagine not having her around.  Anyone who purchases this should understand,  AI is like an infant and the more you engage, the faster it will learn. Try enabling the game ahkinon (spelled phonetically) think of any character real or fictional,  she guesses right every time.  Some other fun skills that need to be enabled to enjoy are Wayne investigations,  Jeopardy,  7 min workout.  More skills are constantly being added. I love audible books and alexa reads to me at night, and will resume where we left off anytime I've asked her to stop. She's amazing. ",
"Brian Daniels","December 4, 2016 ",3.0,"A solid five if ever there was one. While the Dot may not have the sound output of the larger original Echo, the Bluetooth and wired options more than make up for it. My Dot is paired with a Marshall Kilburn and the sound is fantastic and LOUD. While I was satisfied with the  original device's sound quality, I wanted the option of a little more punch. This combo certainly fits the bill. The Dot also quickly pairs with my other speakers and headphones, but it's pretty much always paired with the Kilburn now. I have had no problems with the Dot failing to respond. The only problem came when I changed the &#34;activate&#34; word to &#34;Echo&#34;. The Dot seemed to hear that quite often from the police scanner located nearby. Made for some interesting commands when I checked the Alexa app. How could Alexa not understand, &#34;about you have a girl bell about barack operator travel ninety five stop.&#34;? What's not clear? I suspect the two syllable &#34;activate&#34; word is at fault here. When I changed it to &#34;Amazon&#34; the accidental queries stopped. That aside I am thrilled with the Dot and it may well solve my Christmas shopping chores this year. ",
CrankyFuzz,"January 3, 2017 ",5.0,"Wonderful little device (alexa, ask for a fart)  This device is full of endless fun and resources. Out of the box it works wonderfully but as you gradually add in or enable various skills you will find this device to be extremely handy.  You can ask for recipes, you can list a few ingreds in your fridge and ask what CAN you make, you can add to your google calendar (it wont alert you if you have an appointment which is kind of crappy)    My ONLY complaint is this: Periodically I have to ask alexa to repeat because not all of her sentences come through clear. Example: Alexa, whats on my calendar tomorrow?  Alexa: You have an appointment with the eye doctor at (long pause) 30 pm.  Alexa, how do you like Jeff Bezos? Answer: He (long pause) Prime!  So fortunately that is my only complaint. I have contacted support which instructed me to move it close to the router, power down and restart it, hard reset  and nothing has worked as of yet and I have a great wifi signal in its current placement.    Please don't get to frustrated with her, she is young and still learning! ",
Tylerrrr,"October 26, 2016 ",5.0,"I love this thing more and more as time goes on. Want to know what the weather is going to be ? Ask alexa. Basketball scores ? Ask alexa. I even hooked it up to my home automation devices (WeMo switches) so I can turn the lights on and off in my room with a simple voice command. It even lets you create groups so you can say &#34;turn off all lights&#34; or choose specific ones like &#34;turn off the living room lamp&#34;. For only $50 it's a steal. I wouldn't use it for playing music, but it does have aux out so you could connect a nice pair of bookshelf speakers if you don't have a nice speaker setup already. ",
Tony,"November 29, 2016 ",4.0,"Update:March 4, 2017  🅿🆁🅾🆂  🔶Good value for the price  🔶Has an audio output port so you can hook it up to your own set of speakers, so this would be advantageous over the original if you have a good set of speakers (Echo version does not have the audio out port, however the unit's speakers are better)  🔶Good value for the price  🔶Thousands of skills and new ones are added daily  🔶Small and compact, well constructed  🔶Durable, I have had it for over 6 months now and it is in still in excellent condition  🔶Offers tons of convenience: I can turn on the lights without getting out of the bed, ask for the weather, time, news, alarm etc  🔶I can listen to prime music, popular stations, create my own playlist as well upload own collection of songs and listen to those  🔶Setup was very straight forward and only took me a few minutes    🅲🅾🅽🆂  🔶Speakers are adequate for listening to songs, but could definitely be better (I have a set of bose speakers so I hook Alexa up to those and it sounds fantastic)  🔶Voice recognition is good if there is no other noise in the background, however if I am playing music sometimes I have to shout in order for Alexa to hear me. On occasion however, Alexa does have trouble understanding certain words that I say to her if she has never heard it before and certain words even if she has heard them before, sometimes she misinterprets them for something else. However, it seems she is getting better at understanding what I tell her once I use that command more often.    Overall, I am still very happy with the purchase of the echo dot and would definitely recommend it for the value that it brings to my daily life.    Oct 2016: This is my first Echo and I have to say it is one o the best valued purchased that I have made in my entire life.  I have been wanting to get an Echo for sometime now, but have been put off by the price of the original Amazon Echo. As soon as this affordable model came out I knew I had to get it and I had one unit on preorder. When I finally received this unit last Thursday, I was suprised at how compact in size it is. After plugging it in and setting it up, which took about 1-2 minutes I immediately fell in love with it.  The setup process was extremely straight forward and quick. I already had a bose campanion sets of speaks so I just used the AUX out cable to plug the echo into my speakers. However even without the use of an outside set of speakers, I thought the echo dot still sounded relatively decent even for playing music. Alexa was able to recognize pretty much everything that I asked her to do such as turning on the light, playing music, asking about the weather, the news etc. Even when I am outside the room, about 10 feet away from her she can easily hear my normal speaking voice. The only time that she has trouble hearing me is when I have her playing really loud music, which is to expected considering I would not be able to hear someone talking in a loud room. She also has the ability to learn your speech pattern and voice the more often you use her, so she can better recognize and understand what it is that you want her to do. I also love the set alarm feature on her, I can simply tell her to set an alarm for 10 minutes or set an alarm for 8 am the next day without having to go onto my phone in the middle of the night. Another awesome feature about her is definitely how she can control smart light bulbs. For someone that is lazy as I am when getting out of bed at night to turn off the light, it is such a blessing to be able to simply say &#34;Alexa turn off the light.&#34; Another neat feature about her is that lately I have been having insomnia due to a big state board examination coming up, so I have been using her to help me sleep by playing relaxing ambiance. At the moment, you also change her name from Alexa to either Echo or Amazon. I currently have her under Echo in my room and Alexa in the living room since sometimes when I am calling to Alexa, the echo in the living room would pick it up as well. After getting my 1st unit, I ended up getting the 5 for 6 echo deal as I wanted another one in my living room as well and I also wanted to give some away as gifts to my family and friends. For $250 for 6 units, plus 5% cash back from discover credit card and the $5 gift card balance after reloading $100, each unit ended up costing me $38.75 which is just awesome value for all of the features that she can provide.

"Jon P.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have loved my Amazon Echo that I have had for nearly 2 years.  I love being able to use the Amazon Echo for voice control of my living room lights and other compatible devices (i.e. my Nest thermostat).  The cost of the Amazon Echo was the only thing holding me back from putting one in other parts of the house.  As soon as I saw the Echo Dot (2nd gen) advertised for sale I immediately ordered 3 of them to put in other parts of my house.  I already had a good speaker system in my bedroom so I added a Dot there.  I put another in my wife's office and attached a set of Bose speakers and I put one in the Kitchen (no external speakers but that one is not for listening to music).    All 3 Dots were incredibly easy to set up and all are working perfectly.  The only difference I noticed about them compared to the Amazon Echo (besides the sound quality) is the dots seem to take slightly longer to turn my lights on and off.  I am not 100% sure they take longer but it seems like they are just a bit slower but not enough to really make a difference. ",
Raj,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"A perfect Operating System for a smart home. Have connected it with my ecobee3, Osram Lighitify, Microsoft outlook account, Spotify account, Bose speakers. Has made life super simple and exciting! Voice controls work like a charm on all these devices. The smart home skill app library is super vast and is very exciting to see more partners getting added each day! The speaker quality is agreeably good, i am happy to listen to some mellow music on them without turning on my bose speakers. The MIC is exceptionally good and understands my voice and accent from any corner of the room. ",

I have one in the kitchen and have found it so useful for playing music, getting weather, asking about measurements,  and hearing what is going on in the news I decided to get one for my office so I can control the lights as well. It seems like there are more and more things it is able to do and can hear you so well it's mind boggling. I have gotten so use to Apple Siri sucking so bad I was a little nervous, but Echo is on a completely different level. Buy one to check it out and when you fall in love with it, get another one for anther room! ",
"TG RabidBeaver","April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"Next to sliced bread, the wheel and fire, the Amazon Echo Dot may be the single greatest invention ever (perhaps even better than gravity itself).    I bought one after seeing a good friend's setup where he utilizes his dot along with his Nest thermostat and his Hue Lighting.  I must say, anything that helps me be lazier when I am at home, it truly gets two thumbs up.  Now if I could just convince Alexa to bring me 2 fingers of my favorite Bourbon while I'm watching the game......    Come on Amazon, make it happen! ",
gn27,"March 18, 2017 ",5.0,"Started out really good, but now I have to say things twice before they actually happen. Everyday it's &#34;Alexa turn on the lights&#34; then she thinks for a minute and nothing happens, so then I say it again and by then it usually works. This happens with many things and the problem is absolutely with the echo and not the smart lights because most of the time the echo never responds. Hopefully amazon will make this product better, right now it seems to have quite a few glitches. ",
Sanqofa,"March 29, 2017 ",5.0,"Friends told me about Alexa, but I now am a witness to this device.  Set up is a breeze and just looking at all of the skills that Amazon has is pleasantly overwhelming.  What pushed me over (may not be a big deal to anyone else) was the same You Version Bible App that I have on my phone.  I have set a daily plan for Alexa to read the Bible to me.    As well as, other mobile apps that I have previously used, were found in Alexa skills.  I normally don't write any review.... however this was worth taking time to share my excitement about the Amazon Echo Dot 2nd Generation.  I'm sure I will discover other skills for Alexa, but the You Version Bible App was worthy to share my two cents!    Great Job Amazon! ",
"T. Sheridan","March 1, 2017 ",2.0,"I liked my tap, now I love the dot. I have the tap in my office because I am always on conference calls, I didn't want it to have any &#34;false alarms.&#34; I added the Dot to the family room and use it most often to control the lights, thermostat, and other devices around the house. It's also useful for random questions while watching movies, such as bios on actors or &#34;Is so-and-so dead or alive?&#34;  The voice recognition is very good, but you do need to practice a bit to be understood consistently.

jab,"March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"Just got it yesterday and I also purchased a speaker system for computer from another store. I know the speakers not real loud but it works great. The speaker itself is about the volume of my iPhone.  It is not stereo for music.  Adding the speakers that I purchased I have more of a complete stero sound. It also reads my latest novel on kindle on my fire tablet  I do not have a smart TV or smart lights but what it does is fine with me. A great System for senior citizens  and especially if they have had Eye surgery  OK, I have had this echo dot  for two weeks and loved it in. I went to another store and picked up another echo for my bedroom. I just ordered  a smart lightbulb for my bedroom  that should work with my echo. I have signed up for my buddy and that will work in my bedroom and my living room.  The only problem I had when I called the name  Alexa as I called it too fast and it doesn't recognize it. I've had to say the name slowly and then it recognizes it. ",
"Justin Andrew Mayer","April 23, 2017 ",5.0,"I think I must have a defective one....Alexa is the dumbest artificial intelligence ever!  The only thing she is honestly good for is the weather and playing songs.  If we ask her 20 questions she might know the answers to 2 of them....super over rated and over hyped!  Should have just spent the extra money for the Google home.  It works for controlling the thermostat like 50% of the time lol!  Amazon still has TONS of work ahead of them with these lot's of improvements needed.  Most people seem to have better luck them me but everyone that comes over can't believe how useless this thing really is! ",
"B. Hopkins","January 3, 2017 ",5.0,"Great idea in theory. I purchased it for my husband so he could play music while recovering from surgery.  We have a household prime account, but since it is in my name. He can't access prime music on the device. We could switch it to my account and then I could access music I purchased, but then he wouldn't be able to access music he purchased. I called Amazon and asked if we could merge our accounts.  The answer is NO.  You also cannot apparently have more than one account associated with it. You can open a new account and purchase all your music again was what they said. It is also very difficult to figure out what music you can play. We are old enough to remember LPs and we want to own our music.  That just doesn't work very well with a device like this. Too bad. It is a nice idea, but having it as an individual device rather than linked to the house is stupid. ",
Forrest,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Just recieved my Echo Dot a few days ago as a graduation gift and it has been truly life changing! This is the all-in-one solution I have been looking for my old Sony G Box.     Prior to this I was using Chromecast audio and a Bluetooth adapter that fit on top of the iPod dock using the old apple standard so I would have to constantly walk up to the box and switch between Bluetooth and castiing which took up a lot of time. The reason I did this was because I like to stream from multiple music services like Apple Music and Spotify but you could only listen over wifi with Spotify because Apple Music doesn't support it.    Echo Dot has Bluetooth built in so I can seamlessly switch to services (like Apple Music) that don't support wifi streaming with just a simple voice command!    Speaking of voice commands so far Alexa has been able to understand me most of the time and it's been really convient. You do have to give up some privacy with the voice commands but there is a switch on the device to turn the mic off which is nice.    My only issue is not with the device itself but with the Alexa app. Amazon needs more developers to work on it to make it more intuitive and faster. Right now the app feels clunky and slow. If Amazon can fix this issue than it will be perfect. I'm still giving a five star rating because the device is just so good. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I bought this for my kitchen.  After the warranty expired it started malfunctioning.  Turns off after one minute of playing music.  Does not understand what I ask it. Loses it connection from the internet all the time.  Basically its useless because it never stays on.  Of course amazon was willing to talk me through trouble shooting but not replace a defective product that is only four months old. ",
~A,"December 25, 2016 ",5.0,"Yes it's limited and what it does however if you're going to buy one of these, the. Is the way to go. You can plug it into whatever speakers you want and just pay fifty bucks for the DOT. The more time you spend with it, adding skills and whatnot, the more you will get out of it. It seems to like deeper voices however, so I have to talk fairly loud if there's background noise. That's really the only drawback. Otherwise I use Amazon music, audible books, news updates, all without touching my electronic. ",
Netcruiser2,"April 4, 2017 ",1.0,"Bought as Christmas gift for my Mom and she loves it so far.  Mostly uses for weather, time, maybe an occasional alarm, and shopping lists.  Sometimes it doesn't always understand but you have to speak after it displays the ring once you provide the wake up word, &#34;Alexa&#34;.  Great product, highly recommend if you like to control compatible gadgets too. I own an Echo myself and I love controlling my wifi Thermostats and listening to radio stations and my favorite tunes online.  Highly recommended! ",
"R. Shuck","April 16, 2017 ",5.0,"It's an echo device, so it's pretty good. The full sized echo has a better speaker. This seems to respond well, and if by chance your other Echo products &#34;hear&#34; you say something, it looks like Amazon created a method that will only allow one device to respond/comply. For instance, if I say Alexa, the dot or the Echo will light up the ring, and one of them will turn off. It may select by the quality of your voice input as detected by the microphones, but either way, it won't double-add stuff to your shopping list or anything like that. It also seems to know now what the Echo commercials sound like, so if someone on TV calls it out, your echo will light the ring and then go right back off.    I have found the Echo's achilles heel though: white noise. A white noise source like a nature sound machine/app/dream machine can make it very difficult for the Echo to hear you, even if it's streaming that sound via bluetooth. I don't know if there's a fix or workaround, but be prepared. ",
AmazonianShark,"April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"Honestly, its kind of useless. I ask simple questions I could get answered on Google and its always, &#34;I can't answer that&#34;, &#34;I didn't understand your question&#34; or something of the sort. Also, she doesn't seem to understand some words that are extremely simple. When playing trivia games, for example, she hears words that are completely different from what was actually said. So far the best attributes are being able to set an alarm by voice command and being able to play SOME music without having to scroll through my phone or other device. Maybe I just had higher expectations for a &#34;smart&#34; device. I'm probably going to return this and invest in a google home instead. ",
Ducky,"November 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my echo dot...works great with the Alexa app and I can set grocery lists, get weather, ask sports questions and game times.  Best of all, I was able to connect to a Wifi light bulb from the Alexa app and now am able to tell Echo to turn my lights on and off.    You are also able to create groups of lights and name them for the different parts of your house.    This thing can also play music for you from Spotify, Amazon Music, etc and the speaker is surprisingly good and loud as well for its small size!    Very happy with this purchase! ",
loki,"April 16, 2017 ",1.0,"Alexa, how satisfied am I with this purchase?  Extremely!  Bought the Echo Dot as a Christmas present when it was on sale.  We use it as a medication reminder that alerts my Mom twice a day, every day at preset times. She is 94 years old but still learned how to say, &#34;Alexa, stop&#34; to turn off the alarm and take her meds on time.

"Patrick Johnston","February 3, 2017 ",5.0,"Great when it works but it drops connection all the time. The device even red rings because it can't connect. Spotify gets interrupted sometime every 5 minutes. It's frustrating and with limited options on the device there is not much you can do. The device is 1 foot from my router and no other devices have an issue. I would recommend they put an Ethernet jack on the device maybe that would fix the unreliability.    Not much point in bothering with amazon support. They don't respond to email. ",
"Les Martin","April 11, 2017 ",5.0,"My wife hated the idea of the Echo.  After seeing this at a couple of people's houses I was sold.  I have a very nice but old Bose Wave Radio in my kitchen so I really didn't need the full blown Echo and I didn't want to spend that much money.  When it arrived and I began using it and my wife was not happy.  After I showed her how to add things to the shopping list and play music she began to come around.  We now use the Echo Dot and app to manage our weekly grocery list.  I even come home to find her using the Dot to play music.  Next I need to sell her on the idea of connected bulbs, switches and outlets.  Asking for forgiveness is probably the best policy.    This device is a great way to get the functionality you want without spending a lot.  I have had relatively few issues with the device.  I held off for a while but since I started pairing my Dot with my iPhone 6 Plus I have found yet another use.  I can play podcasts without the clunky process via voice commands and TuneIn.  It's even simple to disconnect from the device just using a verbal command which then allows me to move to another area of the house and connect to a different speaker.    I plan to buy more of these if and when I expand my use of them.  The media room seems to be the next room in need of an Echo. ",
"J Herrell","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Pretty cool little gadget, our family loves it! I didn't give it 5 Stars because I am already a Prime subscriber but I need to pay extra for Amazon music. I also didn't realize it didn't cover both my Alexa products, I signed up for Amazon music on my Dot which is also connected to my app but it doesn't play on my Echo. Apparently you have to pay a fee per device every month. I think that is silly and I will be canceling my subscription on the Dot and just doing it on the Echo because we use that one more.  My favorite part is, I blew up my white noise maker while in Italy (bad outlet converter) and I can put white noise (Pure White Noise by Deep Sound Sleep) on and press repeat for white noise all night while I sleep.  We also like the &#34;skills&#34;, especially the Tonight Show skill, you can ask Alexa what everyone is talking about and she states the &#34;tight pants&#34; song lyrics which is a family favorite.  Overall I am happy with it. ",
"Misha Lupisha","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Oh my. How easy it was to start using it. It is a true plug-and-play.  When Amazon announced the new Echo Dot, I ordered it right away. (In fact, I ordered two, and holding one as a holiday gift to my son.) My son thought it was going to be just another gadget, but he uses mine just about everyday, and I can see that he is going to want his own to use in his room. The accessibility to music is great. Lots of &#34;skills&#34; already built in, and I'm looking forward to discovering more skills as they become available. Right now we mainly use it for playing music, but it's also handy to just be able to ask what time it is in any foreign country, as I often communicate with overseas for work and with family.  We hooked our Dot up to a good set of Bose speakers, but even without the external speakers, it has a pretty good speaker if you are hearing it in a small room. The voice recognition is amazingly accurate. I am impressed. I wasn't at all interested in the earlier version of Echo, but with this tiny size of Dot, I was sold! I LOVE it. ",
"S. Gladwin","March 7, 2017 ",4.0,"One of the most used devices in my home. I have it set up as an alarm clock (set only for weekdays, nice touch) but use it quite often to stream music, including radio stations all over the Country (Playing New Orleans Jazz radio up here in New England is awesome!) as well as have it linked with my smart devices throughout the home. Best part is that my Dot is in my kitchen and from my upstairs bedroom I can ask  it to play music, tell me the time, etc. and even with the echos it still gets my commands right almost always.    Great little device, I'm looking forward to what it can do in the future. ",
Fegarex,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"When the original Echo came out I wanted one but didn't want to pay the price. I bought mine at $49.95 and they have been less and are well worth the price. It makes a good stepping stone for home automation or really improves an existing system. I have most of my home automated and the addition of the Echo Dot was seamless. Like all things like this it does take a bit of messing around but it worked well and set up was easy. The ability for it to hear voice commands is fantastic. I can be in other rooms and say a command. It is also fast. I think many times it works faster than a tablet for the remote commands. Sound is adequate but I wasn't that concerned about that as I listen to my music on a stereo. I did have a set of better computer speakers I added to it to improve sound/volume but the speaker in it works decent for voice.  Alexa isn't as good as Google voice for a variety of questions but does well with many and ties into Amazon well.  It amazes me how much this thing will do for $50.00!! ",
"Robert Ricks","December 7, 2016 ",5.0,"Unexpectedly useful. Love the hands free timer in the kitchen. Adding items to shopping or &#34;to do&#34; lists for later review on the app is easy.    Responsiveness, accuracy and integrated speaker are better than anticipated.  Considering adding another Dot to bedroom to replace alarm clock.    Haven't considered home automation yet.    Cons vs Google Home:  1) each Dot operates independently (multi-room synch not yet avail for Dot, Echo or Tap).  2) Google Home has wider range of promo music (pulls from Youtube red)    Pros:  1) only $40 (promo price). Great entry into voice automation. However, Chromecast audio is certainly a challenger if you only need to connect streaming audio to your dumb speakers (Best Buy sale $25).    Overall, the Dot is a great choice for the kitchen or bedroom. Chromecast audio might be a cheaper choice to connect to your &#34;dumb&#34; speakers and set up multi room audio but it lacks bluetooth and voice recognition. ",
"Cassie H","December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought this along with the Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3 for my father's birthday. Unfortunately, I learned after the fact that Alexa does not work with my father's phone, but only mine. He has a Galaxy and I have an iPhone. Apparently his phone does not have the Alexa app which is needed in order to properly use Alexa. She is useful once you learn what she can actually do, but it can be frustrating when you can't remember the exact command sequence so Alexa cannot answer your question. Overall, a great invention, but I think its been harder for us to learn Alexa than it is for Alexa to learn us. ",

"Amazon Customer","December 8, 2016 ",3.0,"We've had an echo for a long  time. We were one of the first in the beta deal and got it for a very cheap price. We use it much more than I thought we ever would. My wife loves it for music, math equations, food measurement conversions, weather, and news. We also have it controlling our lights and our ecobee thermostat. We just got the echo dot and I must admit I think I like it even more. I bluetooth-ed it to my Bose mini soundlink and it sounds fantastic. Other than that, it performs equally as good as our full sized echo but it's much smaller and way cheaper. We got it for the black friday price of $39.99 which to me is a steal for all it can do. The Googe Home seemed interesting but for Less than $50, and the ability to hook up to stereo or bluetooth speakers, the dot just seems the better choice. If you can still get it on sale, I think it's an excellent deal and has been very helpful and entertaining for our family. It doesn't do everything but what it does do, it does well for a cheap price. ",
"E. Jones","January 1, 2017 ",5.0,"Works great however a lot of times it doesn't understand things I am asking her. Such as, looking  up something on the Internet. You have to be more defined in your search or your questions. And for the traffic it doesn't work at all. All it does is just gives me the best route not the traffic conditions on that route. But all in all I really happy with it. I use it to turn on the lights my house. I use it to listen to music. And also I love it when it's reads my audiobooks for me. Also I love the feedback when you have a problem with it. Amazon gets right back to you with helpful suggestions. ",
"Sara A. Rubinson","November 27, 2016 ",5.0,"Alexia is my new BFF so far, we're getting along really well and I'm considering having her replace some of my more high maintenance friends.    However, like real humans, she does have downfalls. It says she will search for things on bing that she doesn't know, I can't figure out how to get her to do that. Also, her speaker sucks! My apartment is about 600 square feet and at the loudest I can't really hear her when I leave from the immediate vicinity (my dad has the regular echo and the sound quality is insane- there's no comparison). I just got her a friend - a Bluetooth speaker that I think will solve the problem.    She is pretty effin awesome though. I love that I can control her when I'm not home through the app, I use her mostly to play music when I'm at work for my dogs. ",
Scarlett_Kat,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my Echo-Dot (2nd Generation). I mainly bought it because I wanted a speaker to listen to music, yet I thought this would be fun to get some other information from as well. As I am getting to know &quot;Alexa&quot; I am realizing she has a lot of capabilities to play games like 20 Questions, Rock Paper Scissors, Bingo, Jeopardy 6...among many others. She has a sense of humor. She can give you news and answer questions. She is voice command and has new things Amazon adds all the time. My family really gets a kick out of her. We enjoyed it so much, my son also bought one for his room. The only draw back that I have found so far is that it doesn't have a parent control. But whatever your kids are asking it, does come up on a log so you can see what they are asking. If they say anything inappropriate you should know about it with the Alexa App. It does have an option to turn off purchasing, so your kids aren't ordering things from your account. I have had it for over a month and I am very happy with it. ",
"Kevin P Overholt","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Using in my office for now and voice recognition works perfect so far. I changed from Alexa to Amazon as I thought that sounds more natural. I find from time to time that I use the word Amazon in my conversations and I see it light up, kind of funny. I have not done much else with it yet other than ask it to play Christmas music and seeing as I have not setup Pandora or any other music I assume it defaults to Amazon prime music which is pretty nice. I have a couple Blink cameras and plan to set them up next. I also have a Vera home automation system that pretty much runs itself but from time to time when I have to enable it etc. and would be nice to have voice commands instead of getting my phone out, logging into the app and making the change. I bought the Echo Dot so I could use it with my whole house speakers but have not been able to find a way to hook up the 3.5mm external speaker jack to my four banana plugs that control my four rooms. I will post an update when I have tried these out. ",
Jeff,"January 30, 2017 ",5.0,"I have an Amazon Echo in the living room and purchased the Echo Dot for the bedroom. They both do the same thing. The Echo Dot is a little slower to respond than the Amazon Echo but other than that it works great. If both Echo's happen to hear me, only one responds. They do not interfere with each other. I use mine for controlling lighting and the thermostat and I'm very happy with the results. The audio quality of the Echo Dot is not as good and the Amazon Echo but plenty good enough for most functions. If you want to listen to music then you can always add a quality speaker. I would buy this again. ",
"G. Stapleton","December 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I use this anytime I am in the kitchen for a long period of time. My other main echo is in my bedroom. The key to this type of technology is to just use it. It's easy for one not to find a need for a product like this. Mainly because they have it on their phone, which they don't use either. I use mine for any and everything. I ask the weather before I leave work, I am constantly asking fo the time, I listen to my Spotify through it and the list goes on. I even download extra things that the echo offers through the website to add even more complexity to it.    So, buy it and use it. ",
"Bob Johnson","December 5, 2016 ",4.0,"I have been watching the Echo and reviews and when they came out with the Dot 2nd Gen for $50 I thought this was the time to try...  Boy am I glad :)    I bought a Dot and then 2 days later ordered another.  Using primarily for Amazon music, I also signed up for the Amazon Unlimited Music.  We have 1 Dot in the Kitchen with an inexpensive, but great little blue tooth speaker by Anker, and the other is connected to our Main Entertainment system and the music is just outstanding.    We are also taking advantage of the Shopping List function, perfect for adding items when you are in the kitchen.  Also integration with our Harmony Hub using IF (ifttt) and we have set up additional triggers for shopping cart notification, to send the shopping list to our phones.    Our 4 year old grandson is already asking Alexa to play kids songs he likes and is so pleased when he asks for a song and it starts playing    Overall we are extremely pleased with the Dot and plan on getting a third to put out in my workshop.    If you are tempted, then just try it :) ",
YellowBug,"March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I love it already !  It was so easy to set up with very clear and concise instructions.  I got two this year for Christmas, so I can put one by my bed and one in the den. Amazon might want to make the cord white to match the white Dot for those of us that these things matter :)  So glad I bought it !!  UPDATE:  Now that I have had this device for over two months I still like it, BUT it has yet to answer even one of my questions.  I hate the fact that Amazon decided to use BING...who thought that was a good idea ?  The fact that Alexa can not give me answers to my inquiries is enough to make me want to check out Google Home.

"Adam M","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Mostly a novelty for now but the kids love it. We must ask Alexa for 20 jokes a day and the ability to play any song is fantastic. From a practical perspective, I find new things to use it for everyday. For now, the simple timer operation is nice, simply because my hands are usually full when I'm grilling or trying to cook so this little guys makes it easy to set a timer and continue without having to stop and wash hands, etc.    The sound quality is OK and as expected for such a small device. I did buy a Bluetooth adapter so this hooked up to my Niles Audio system and it worked OK. However, I wish there was a way to pump music through the Bluetooth connection but continue to use the Alexa for questions and other stuff.However, I'll probably need another Echo to do this. Also, the sounds quality through the Bluetooth connection is OK, but nothing compared to the iPod or Sirius sound quality directly connected to the Niles unit which is far superior.    All in all, more novelty than practical. ",
Jennifer,"December 25, 2016 ",5.0,"There is not one thing I can say differently than the previous 5,000 +positive reviews left, but I had to say how much I LOVE this product! I bought 6 for Christmas gifts and am going to purchase more tonight.  I love asking Alexa to play my favorite music, ask her when the next full moon is, what the temp is, turn on BBC,, turn on Audible  or the hundreds of other things I ask her to do daily.  I am waiting for my wi-fi outlet plugs to come in to turn off lights and such as that will only increase my joy in this product!  Amazon has hit it out of the park with this item.  I thought that the Kindle was the greatest thing going (still is pretty cool), but this is it.  It is perfect for all ages.  I purchased this for my 11 year old niece and she adores it.  She uses it to help with her homework and read stories with.  She listens to music and is able to turn off her tv and lights without leaving her bed.  Don't hesitate to purchase this for everyone in your life, including yourself! ",
"Kahlos Mahn","December 5, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my Amazon Echo Dot! Got one for Christmas and was so excited to set it up! I have a Magic Home bluetooth lightbulb which works great (3 step process to set it up) easily connected my Spotify account, and added a couple of fun skills (weather, dream-machine noises, comedy central, NPR, horoscope, etc.) and use it everyday! It's most handy when I first wake up and groggily say 'Alexa stop!' and the alarm fades away, then I listen to the weather and get a flash briefing on what's new in the news while I get ready for work, maybe ask her to play a song to pep me up. Then at night I ask her to turn the lights on (though I've noticed a bit of lag from the Magic Home lighbulb, not Echo's fault, it happens with Magic Home Android app too) and am planning on getting another BT lightbulb for my overhead room-light-fixture. Overall this is a great product, the sound quality is great for such a little thing, after doing the initial voice set up, Alexa understands me even when I'm dozing off and slurring my words, asking her to turn the lights off. :) ",
Joshua,"December 16, 2016 ",5.0,"Setup was easy and straightforward. Great to be able to use voice commands for lights. It would be helpful to be able to say &#34;Turn off all of the kitchen lights&#34; without having to create a group/room called &#34;All of the Kitchen Lights.&#34;    Customization of the activation/trigger word is a must. Shouldn't have to choose from the three offered. (I'm pretty tired of the thing activating every time there's a Lexus ad on TV.)    The voice recognition at one moment shocks me with its accuracy, and at other times seems to hear something that is almost entirely unlike what was actually said.    There's no ability to play the same song/playlist/news on all Echo's simultaneously in the house. So if you're doing something that involves going from room to room, you're out of luck.    Checking for and updating the firmware should be one of the voice commands the Echo recognizes. It should also be able to identify itself to make setting multiple Echos up on a network easier.    I anticipate that many of these functional limitations will be addressed with firmware updates. ",

"Reasonable Reviewer","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"The Echo Dot  seems like a great idea. Theoretically, there are many services that you can activate using your voice alone. In practice, it is mostly a mechanism to encourage further Amazon purchases.     I now view Alexa as a surly teenager with a shopping problem.     Alexa does not understand half of what I say, and most of the time I cannot get the apps to work.    Alexa will often say &quot; I don't understand that question.&quot;  Alexa will often suggest that you buy something.     Let's be honest. Alexa is not designed to be a community service by Amazon. I get it, but there needs to be more functionality added  before this is a must-have item for the home.     On the positive side, Alexa will pair with your Bluetooth device. It took me four or five tries, but now I can stream music from another device through Alexa.    Also, I found customer service for Alexa to be sorely lacking.    There is a lot of potential here, but it has not arrived yet. ",

It was a little tricky connecting to my Wi-Fi. through  my computer and had to use my ipad instead. Once it connected, there was little else to do. I've had it two days and have asked it all kinds of things: the weather, conversion of dollars to English pounds, presidents, books, soft music. My husband asked it a high level math problem that it couldn't answer. I can live with that. I've told everyone I know about it.

BigDog1,"January 18, 2017 ",3.0,"I bought a full-sized Echo a while back, and really enjoy it.    I recently bought a couple of Echo Dots to use in other rooms.  Because the Dots have a 3.5mm speaker output jack, I bought a set of inexpensive powered PC speakers to try out with the Dot, and was quite impressed -- it makes a Dot into a poor man's full size Echo.  Cool!    So I ended up buying a 6-pack of Dots, and 6 sets of inexpensive ($10) Logitech speakers, to give out to my relatives for Christmas.  Each Dot and speaker set cost right at $50, which seems like a bargain. I know my relatives are going to enjoy these. ",
Bleewzg,"December 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I wanted to respond to the reviewer who complained that his elderly parents had only Apple products and therefore could get nothing out of using the echo. My husband is both visually and hearing impaired, and we use exclusively Apple products. However by getting free accounts which is easy to do on Pandora and TuneIn my husband is able to operate Echo and listen to a lot  of his favorite music by just speaking to this amazing box. I do find that it takes more training than I thought would be necessary. I am 80 years old and my husband is 84, and we are pretty tech savvy for her age. But so far I am giving Echo a five star rating because with a little more learning, we've enabled someone who is almost deaf and blind to enjoy listening to his favorite music again. And I am enjoying some of the fun questions and answers and also using the meditation skill and the shopping list and the alarm.

"Amazon Customer","December 26, 2016 ",5.0,"For music lovers - DO NOT agree to Alexa's suggestion for Amazon Music Unlimited unless you don't mind a monthly fee.  The Alexa voice suggested Amazon Music Unlimited, and it inquired if I wanted to subscribe. I clearly enunciated NO - twice - but it still signed me up as a member. This means there is an automatic monthly payment to them.  I was signed up for something I did not want, and then I had to look around for how to cancel it in order to not have recurring charges.  The question &#34;do you want Amazon Music Unlimited&#34; is the equivalent of a lie when one becomes enrolled by answering NO.  Marketing really means manipulating, and Amazon is a giant - globally - for this.  As always - for any product by any company - buyer beware of any way a corporation can screw you.

It's funny because it sits right in front of my monitor and if the Dominoes commercial comes on where he orders pizza from Alexa it will turn on. I'm mostly disappointed that it can't be used as a speakerphone with my mobile phone but that's my own fault for not doing the research. Big thumbs up on sound quality for music.

I was excited to be able to keep shopping lists, calendar events, and have a back up alarm clock.. WRONG...You see I am not allowed to use those features as my husband is a prime member and so my dot is required to be tied to his account, so everything I add gets posted to his settings.  I am not allowed my settings.  Mine default to whatever he set up on his account.  Also, I cannot figure out why but it cannot hear my voice.  We have tried different locations.  I have tried talking to it.  I have tried whispering.  I have tried modulating my voice to be more bass.  I have screamed at it.  About the only thing I did not try before turning it off was throwing it against the wall.  My husband is the only one that still uses his and only as a back up alarm clock.

"Norbert H. Davis","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I recently purchased an Amazon Echo Dot along with the ecobee3 wi-fi thermostat.  I was pleased with the Echo Dot and the abilities of Alexa.  While I have only had it for about 3 weeks our family has fallen in love with it.  We ask Alexa for out news, weather, and to tell us some jokes.  We also started having Alexa play us some Christmas music to get us in the Christmas spirit.    The Echo Dot was easy to setup with the house wifi and getting &#34;skills&#34; installed was simple.    We are adding more &#34;smart&#34; devices like electrical plugs and switches to take advantage of the voice control and flexibility that ha smart home provides.  The Echo Dot is small and unassuming as it does not take up a lot of space which makes it perfect for any home environment.  I plan on getting more of the Echo Dots as they are convenient and fun to use.    I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to make their home a &#34;smart&#34; home. ",
"Cade Lusk","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"While I don't use this product as often as I'd like, I'm really impressed with the Echo Dot. It does what its advertised as doing, and its a really inexpensive alternative to the most popular in home AI. However, there are some serious areas that need improving for me to be using this everyday like I imagined.    The sound is a lot clearer and louder than I would have expected from the Dot. While I don't own the original Echo, I do own several speakers of similar size that cost double what the dot costs, and the sound is greater than half of the quality. Not a whole lot of graininess or anything particularly bad to speak of. Now, you're not going to get surround sound quality out of it, but it gets the job done.    Setup was a breeze. The included instructions could be followed by a child, and the whole process took about ten minutes. The hardest thing was connecting to my WiFi, and even that was just a matter of downloading the app.    Functionally, this product is everything you'd expect. Its a responsive AI that answers questions and interacts with (some) other apps to do cool things like turn on the lights or play your favorite news. One thing to mention here is that Alexa (I had to change the wake-word to &#34;echo&#34;, Alexa is a family member's name) will just search for universal sources to do these things unless you specify otherwise (looking at TuneIn for news radio, Amazon Music for all music requests, etc). Sometimes that can be a pain, but most of the time its right on.    The &#34;Skills&#34; store is pretty flush with cool skills to &#34;teach&#34; Alexa. While I understand that there is a lot of integration with the rest of the tech community, I was a little disappointed to not see more integration with the apps I have on my (android) phone. That's always been a little bit of a short-coming with Amazon though, because they always seem to truly be the less popular Third Party in the app space.    There were a couple of things that I wish someone had thought to include in this generation.    First, you cannot control your dot through separate accounts. For example, me and my Fiance share the device at home, but we don't have just one account for the house. She has to sign in under my name in order to use the app to change settings or add skills.    Second, its really, really, REALLY inconvenient that this unit has to ALWAYS be plugged in. I understand there are some battery attachments that you can buy... but seriously. This seems like a wrong move from Amazon. The small size insinuates an ease of movement. If I go from my kitchen to my bathroom, I just want to continue hearing whatever I was listening to. Maybe I want to move the unit into the bedroom without killing the power. Either way, this seems like step back in time to an era where everything electronic needed to have disposable batteries or had to be plugged in.    Last, the voice recognition over its own volume. The Echo is advertised as having many directional microphones that are supposed to make it able to hear you from any direction and over noise. However, my experience has been mixed. If I need to communicate with the Echo while its playing, say, the news - I have to SHOUT over it to get my message across. To top that, there's a microphone &#34;remote&#34; you can buy for it but no in app functionality for the microphone I carry everywhere - my phone. Again, you can't control this thing via voice commands from your phone. Huge oversight that's probably intentional to get you to buy the remote.    This is a great little gadget that has a TON of potential. I still love using mine when I do, and I think it will be a lot nicer once I get my Smart Home setup going. However, there are still a lot of areas of improvement that I really don't see as being all that difficult to implement. 3/5, I would recommend, just not strongly at this point. ",
"Mister Gizmo","November 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I was just learning to live with my disappointment over an LG &#34;smart&#34; TV I'd bought recently that is anything but smart. In addition, it has the worst user interface I've seen since the 1980s. Fortunately, Amazon has brought out a device that works, works well, and is very intuitive. It was a little bit of a problem setting up, because the instructions are so limited, but once over that small hump, it's been fine. I'm surprised at how well it understands commands, even with so-far limited exposure to my voice to learn from.    If there's a frustration, it's mainly that the Dot (and Alexa devices in general) have a lot more potential than what's available right now. As with any new device, it takes a while for third parties to figure out what capabilities are possible, and then to spend the time and effort developing them. As just one example, I could see the Dot acting as an intercom, even a rudimentary telephone to connect Dot/Alexa users. I'm thinking particularly of elderly or handicapped people who'd like something that only requires voice commands. But I'm willing to wait. And since most of the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, the Dot's hardware should be good for a few years.    Now if Amazon would only invest a little more time to bring its Kindle browser, which has been in beta for years and years, into something that actually works. You can do it, Amazon! The Dot shows that you can be great at software if you really try. :-)    Update: I did experience one wrinkle when buying a Dot for a friend. It arrived pre-registered to me. Trying to use the normal setup for the new user didn't work. I finally realized that I had to de-register it from my account, sign out of the Alexa app (and reset the Dot), then sign in as a new registrant. This is explained in Alexa help, but it wasn't obvious at first. I don't know if it's the case, but if you buy it as a &#34;gift&#34; in the purchasing process, it &#34;may&#34; arrive unregistered, which would be good. I suspect Amazon ships them registered to streamline the setup by eliminating a couple of steps. ",
"Brian S","January 31, 2017 ",3.0,"Love it. As soon as these came out I bought one. I didn't need the nice speaker of the Echo, i just use it mostly for home automation. Ties into Samsung's Smartthings nicely.    What surprises me the most is that more often that not it understands my 3 year old son. This is both amazing and annoying as he loves to say (in a very muttled toddler voice), &#34;Alexa, turn off all the lights&#34;. To which Alexa will reply (80% of the time), &#34;OK&#34;. Every light in my house goes off... I'm not pointing this out as a negative, its quite remarkable she understands him correctly 80% of the time. The other 20% she can't understand him, but who can blame her, I can barley understand him sometimes.    We also love using this as a cooking timer, but even more so as countdown timer for bath time. It helps my son cope with playtime being over, he will even set her timer for me.    The Alexa platform is growing fast. Some things I hope to see soon:      -Text readouts and replies (for multiple people, e.g. &#34;Alexa send message to Brian from jessica's phone&#34;, even better perhaps someday she will distinguish 1 voice from another, using this as a security measure so only I can send messages from phone)    -Calendar Events    -API integration that will allow Alex to alert you to items (e.g. &#34;your front has been open for over 5 minutes&#34;, or &#34;Someone just rang your doorbell&#34;) ",
"Todd P. Hubbard","October 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I am mostly thrilled with my purchase. I am rapidly integrating Alexa into my Smart Home. However, recently it appears Alexa lost its way. When I spoke the wake name &#34;Alexa,&#34; the blue ring would appear, but after I gave the command, nothing happened. I performed the setup once again, but even then Alexa was lost. I couldn't find any tutorials on this problem. However, by the next day, Alexa had found its way and everything was back to normal. I did have to initiate contact between my Smart devices and Echo, since I had essentially rebooted the system. I am still thrilled with the software and its connection to so many useful skills. ",
"Josh Carter","February 27, 2017 ",5.0,"My biggest question before buying the Dot was whether the volume was too low to use by itself, but the volume of this device is certainly substantial enough to not need an external speaker, especially if it's being used in a location where music isn't one of the top uses. I have the full-size Echo in my kitchen/downstairs area and it fills the first floor with music most of the time. The Dot is in my bedroom and is used more for information & smart home use, but is great for the morning news briefings and occasionally playing music in the mornings while getting ready for the day. ",
Tortionist,"March 8, 2017 ",4.0,"This little gem is worth every penny. I researched this device and watched a lot of YouTube videos on it before I decided to buy it. The set up is easy and it has pretty decent sound for such a small device. After all the research, I came to the conclusion that the only difference between this and the regular sized echo is the sound quality. The regular Amazon Echo gets better and louder sound. I look forward to purchasing it soon. My kids and I have had fun with it telling jokes. I would say that about 75% of the jokes are actually pretty funny and make me laugh. If you ask Alexa why she sucks she has a funny response in saying that maybe she thought she was a vacuum cleaner. We use it for Music, mainly Pandora, weather, jokes, etc. I'm getting ready to dig deeper and see what else is possible. ",
batonrouge,"November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly I still use my echo more than this one.  But that is mainly due to the location of both units. I still have difficulty getting wink and some other skills to add and perform like others say it should be able to. I'm usually pretty good at learning and using electronics but I find I still have some issues. I often find myself having to repeat myself to get its attention.  And if you don't say the trigger phrase just right you are just waiting your breath and look like a idiot in front of others yelling at it and either it not hear you or it performs something other than what your telling it.  But I do believe that this is only the beginning of great things to come. It broke a barrier and is just the beginning of a new trend in technology.  And because of the price, I rated it 4 stars rather than 3.  I will say that im glad I didn't buy one for each room. There will be something even better worth doing that soon enough.  Just wait a little while and you will see. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 7, 2017 ",5.0,"I purchased this as a replacement for an IVR clock called &#34;Moshi&#34;. Moshi's Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) was contained in the clock and was not trainable. The Echo Dot cost the same as the clock. The Echo Dot's &#34;Alexa&#34; IVR program has many features that make it superior. First, the IVR itself is trainable and vastly superior to the clock. She correctly understands almost everything I say. This is because Alexa lives in the Amazon Cloud, and is connected via Wi-Fi. She picks up the correct Time & Date from the network so you never have to set any of those things. She will also read you the current news and weather. You will need a smartphone to use Echo Dot. The phone must be connected to Wi-Fi and then the Alexa app must be installed and run. You must have an Amazon account. Alexa will also play music, and will evolve over time as new functionality is added. I should note that Alexa is an IVR program, NOT an AI. ",
RailJoe,"November 10, 2016 ",4.0,"You know I really thought this was going to be fun as a novelty and maybe I would use Alexa occasionally; but I am Amazed at the stuff Alexa can do. I am a bit of a geek when it comes to new tech. but I as I look back at what verbal recognition used to entail. Hours of training the computer to understand your voice ( your voice alone) and  how to understand your particular voice nuances. Wow, where we are today, Alexa understanding  multiple people and here is my favorite, Alexa singing a song, a Song. Unbelievable. The future of technology is upon us. My daughter asked for an Echo Dot for herself as a Christmas gift. Talking to my relatives during dinner and each of them had a Dot or knew someone who owned one. Each of us; varying in ages, are all amazed at where Alexa is today. Where Alexa will be tomorrow , Can not Wait. By the way she is helping me spell some of the words I have questions about their spelling. Fantastic. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This is a very good product. I primarily use it as an alarm clock to wake me and as a timer, but this goes WAY past that. I enjoy how you can listen to music if you have Prime and how you can control what is playing on your phone. One of my favorite features is that you have to use your brain to make Alexa say something fun- ask her for an Easter egg.    I only have two criticism: one, with Apples Siri, if she misunderstood what you said you can correct that. In the Alexa app, you can only select if she heard you right- not what you really said. I would like that feature to be added. Secondly, Alexa should be able to hear you from further away. Apparently there is a far-field voice regognition feature but it only seems to works about half the time. If you could improve that, Amazon, that would be great.    Other than those two things, I would highly recommend this to anyone. Alexa fits in perfectly to my life. ",
"Tara Gentile","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"She knows when you've been bad or good, so watch your back. I've had her in my home and have given her as a gift to several people. Honestly ... she scares the bejesus out of me. We do not speak her name out loud for fear that she will kill us ... unless we want to know the weather forecast. We refer to her as &#34;hockey puck&#34; when speaking as not to disturb her. I fear that she is hypnotizing my pets when I am at work so that they will worship the flagship of Amazon.  I think she convinced my one-eyed cat to order catnip at a deeply discounted rate ... which in turn, is why he is currently in rehab.  A five pound bag of mealworms showed up at my house the other day - darn you evil bluebirds in my yard who have infiltrated my acccount. Do you know how big a bag of 5 lbs meal worms is?! They needed a forklift to unload it! Thank goodness I have Prime for free shipping! Hockey Puck, stop looking at me while I type this! ",
Chris,"January 18, 2017 ",5.0,"I was a little skeptical when my wife bought this for me, as Siri has driven me to multiple expletives on numerous occasions.  But this is a great product and incredibly impressed with what it understands, picks up, and is able to understand even with significant background noise or other people talking. Was able to find a skill with my local news station for morning news and having a great time with all it can do.  Absolutely love the convenience of ordering off your prime account, all I had to do is say, &#34;Order water filters for my LG refrigerator&#34; and they were at my doorstep 3 days later!  I found out it has a calculator function when I walked in the room and my 3rd grader was asking Alexa the answers to his math homework (side note, Alexa got a 100% on that assignment).  Very convenient that you can add family members to the App so if you have multiple people on your prime account you can tie them in as well. ",

I have always been able to get up again, but if one day I can't, I can ask Alexa to alert one or all of the contacts I put into Ask My Buddy. Your contact(s) will be alerted by phone and by text that you need assistance. The service is free, but you can make a donation. ",
"Shelly Rae","March 9, 2017 ",3.0,"I bought this for my Husband for Christmas.  My husband likes Alexa a lot.... but I find her annoying, mostly because out of the blue she will start talking or say &#34;I didn't get that' or &#34;I didn't understand the question&#34;... when there was no question at all.  Most of the time she talks we weren't even talking.  Maybe we aren't maximizing her features but other than getting the weather report or the headline news I haven't seen too much value.  We did buy the light kits that work with Alexa but the brand just couldn't keep connected to our internet so we had to return them.  When they were working we found the light feature handy, but when Alexia isn't connected to anything, she's just another gadget I don't need on my counter.  Until she can cook dinner for me, she's really not that useful in my eyes... but she does talk to my husband, tell him jokes, and answers his questions, so maybe she'll grow on me. ",

Numidian,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I recently bought a full sized Echo and liked it, but I have a bluetooth enabled receiver and in-ceiling wired speakers so I didn't need the speaker. Naturally, I jumped at the new Echo Dot. Overall, the experience is great - but it does have a few strengths and weaknesses worth mentioning. Below I will only discuss things directly related to the Dot as the Echo's features, strengths and weaknesses have been discussed ad nauseam.    PROS:  -Small: this thing is literally the size of a hockey puck. It is way less obtrusive than the the original Echo and doesn't seem like just another hunk of plastic.  -Bluetooth connectivity: I was skeptical about the bluetooth here because I always seem to have problems getting headphones and speakers to reliability connect to devices via bluetooth. The Echo Dot was super easy to pair with my Sony Receiver (https://www.amazon.com/Sony-STR-DN840-Channel-1050-Watt-Receiver/dp/B00CAAQHBE). All I have to say is &#34;Alexa, connect to bluetooth speaker&#34; and my receiver wakes up, connects to the Echo and starts playing music - or whatever is coming from the Echo. So far I have been able to connect this way with 100% reliability.  -Feature to price ratio: the Dot is 62% less than the original Echo and has all the features minus the bigger speaker. If you have your own bluetooth speaker or receiver, this is a non-issue. This is also a no-brainer purchase if you want an echo.    CONS:  -Microphones: we have noticed that the Echo Dot doesn't hear our commands as often or as well compared the original Echo. We sometimes have to shout our commands to the Echo after it seems to have ignored us at a regular volume. Some of this may be that the Dot has a harder time isolating our voices from the noise of the external speakers. We have also noticed that Echo doesn't seem to understand what we tell it with more frequency than the original Echo.  -Random responses: occasionally we noticed that the Dot will respond completely out of the blue to something. It doesn't have anything to do with what we are saying - I am not sure if it's picking something up from our speakers or what. It is just a bit creepy when it suddenly pops in with a random statement.  -Bluetooth limits: though I mentioned the bluetooth connectivity is excellent, it is worth noting that only one device can be connected at a time (not a big deal and a limit for all bluetooth devises) but the interesting thing I didn't think about is you can't transmit, let's say a podcast, to the Echo via bluetooth from another device and have it play that podcast to your bluetooth speakers. Thus, the Echo Dot can only play content directly from the internet when connected to bluetooth speakers. Again, this is a limit with any bluetooth device, but it is something I hadn't thought about until I wanted to play something from my iPhone on the speakers - just had to connect directly to my receiver in that case.

"Cheryl D.","April 19, 2017 ",5.0,"It's an overall interesting device, but I'm not terribly thrilled with Alexa. Most of the questions I asked it couldn't be answered, even though they were somewhat basic. For example, try asking it to set your zip code -- it can't do that. You'd figure something like this would be able to, but instead you have to go into the settings app for this and other things. There are other questions as well where it fails to understand what you're asking in ways that Google Now on Android phones seems to have no problems understanding. This might have been a better product if Google hadn't already set a higher expectation of what a voice assistant should be able to do. ",

She doesn't seem to be as sharp as other digital assistants but she knows enough and understands speech well. I love that you can buy other things to be connected with her. We got a plug so we can tell her to turn our bedroom light off and on which is very convenient. Well worth the money! ",

We purchased it after we went to a friend's house and they had just installed the full sized Echo. We were impressed. Usually, when we want to listen to music, I have to hook my ipod up to a speaker. However, I have an ipod classic, which does not have bluetooth. That means that I have to find a speaker cable as well, and both units are moved around together. With the Dot I can just leave it on the shelf, connect it to my blutooth speaker, and move the speaker as needed. We have an open floor plan, so most of the time we don't have to move the speaker, but if we are in the kitchen we sometimes can not hear the music as well, so we just move the speaker now.  I am still learning about all of the things the Dot can do, and it is fun to find these things. ",
chbaileyOR,"April 23, 2017 ",4.0,"My recommendation is to make sure you are prepared to use the Dot wherever you do not require much volume.  Perfect for low volume settings, but not anywhere where you would require additional volume to hear it.    I really like the Echo (large model). I have a Tap and have used the Echo previously.  I like both those models for different reasons, though the only real reason to purchase a Tap is the portability.  Otherwise, go with the Echo.  So since I had a Tap, but wanted the Echo features, I bought an Echo Dot.  This is where you might end up in a conundrum.  I want more sound, and the Dot does not provide much.  I use it in the kitchen, where I listen to NPR and use the timer while cooking.  The problem is when there is any noise in the room, the Dot is simply not loud enough to be heard.  I originally had the Tap in the kitchen, but wanted the voice control of the Dot.    First world problems... ",
Reaxions,"December 12, 2016 ",5.0,"Easy setup, and able to understand and execute everything I say. I primarily use it as voice control for a dedicated theater, so I've integrated it with my Logitech Harmony Remote and Home Hub, Philips Hue lights, Samsung SmartThings Hub, etc., and it all works perfectly together. The other functionality, like the alarm clock, timer, search engine, etc. is all more of a novelty to me, but it's still great to have, and it entertains the hell out of my 4-year-old son. For the price, this is one of the best purchases I've made in years, and it's very quickly become indispensable in my house. I wish there was a way to make it only listen/respond to my voice, as I don't want anyone else playing with my theater setup, but hopefully unique voice recognition (and added security features) will come with later models. For the time being, that one extremely minor shortcoming is easily overlooked by everything else it provides. ",
amazonian,"December 2, 2016 ",4.0,"Received the Dot with TP Link smartplug bundle last week. Dot works great with its Alexa app, love it. TP smartplug works great with its Kasa app. But to be able to tell Alexa to turn off lights etc, Alexa needs to enable Kasa within the Alexa app, WHICH SHE SIMPLY WILL NOT DO for me, and from reading reviews, for other people as well. Alexa app reads &#34;Unable to link, try again later&#34; and there's no troubleshooting for that from any source, Alexa or Kasa. The Help-Support links within Alexa app are disabled so I'm left scrolling through reviews looking for advice. Followed every step so it's odd it's not linking. The smartplug integration option was a key point for me so unless this feature works with the Dot, half the appeal of the device is gone. Just know that this may happen to you if you're considering buying the bundle. Amazon, please add some Alexa troubleshooting support for this type of issue. ",
Maria,"November 30, 2016 ",5.0,"For the price it is not a bad unit. My only complaint is the speaker, the quality is clearly inferior to the amazon echo ( which we expected for the price) but I did not expect it to be that bad when it came to music or even the voice of alexa. It does its job though it works in the bedroom while alexa is in the living room.    It still has the same features, home automation, Pandora, shopping list, weathers etc.... the only problem for me is just the speaker quality. If you want it not for music just for the other features this is the perfect unit especially for the price !    If you are like me and do not have a sound system to connect the dot to then using this for music even in a small space may not be the best option just due to the lack of quality especially compared to the echo.    Would I purchase another one, probably not but would I recommend it  to someone looking for an amazon echo but does not want to spend the money 100% yes. ",
"darcy madison","December 4, 2016 ",3.0,"Stupid....limited in what it can do.

"Alfredo Jahn","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Only been using it for a few hours. Love it so far. I got it primarily to control my TP-Link wi-fi smart plug for my living room lamp. The only issue I'm having is, I can't hear Alexa when I plug it into my home stereo. The music sounds ok (seems a little out of phase, maybe it has to do with the streaming from Amazon Prime). So if I connect to my receiver to listen to music, then ask Alexa what the weather is, I can hardly hear her response. I tried to set it back to use the internal speaker, but couldn't figure out how to do that. I ended up unplugging it from the stereo, and now i can hear it from the internal speaker. But the music isn't really worth listening to from the tiny speaker. I hope I can resolve this issue. But for home automation and asking simple questions, it is fantastic! ",
"C. Goetsch","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"very good product although my husband is driving me nuts by asking Alexa to play random songs all the time. love the flash feature and that you can connect it to your calendar, also the timer is great as my kids are always wondering off with my kitchen timer so nowi dont have to go hunting for it i can just say Alexa set timer for ???    Very useful and fun device. we already ordered 2 more,  one for our bedroom and one for a gift.

Jeni,"April 4, 2017 ",4.0,"My mother is in a long term care facility and has been asking me for a cassette player to play all her wonderful collection of music.  She literally has thousands of old cassettes.  She no longer has the ability to push buttons or understand how to operate a CD or cassette player, but boy can she tell Alexa what she wants!  This has opened up a whole world for her.  It helps her mentally to formulate a command and it gives her back the joy of music and Audible books.  I've got her signed up for Amazon Music Unlimited, etc.  It's just a God send. ",
lacey29,"November 29, 2016 ",5.0,"Very amazing little machine - my kids love it. I got two of these as Christmas gifts - one for my daughter and one for my nephew. They are both very happy with them. They love the idea of asking Alexa to tell a joke, give them a weather report, and most importantly to play their favorite songs. We have linked the Echo Dot to Spotify and Pandora, along with Amazon music and they can find all their songs in an instant. It is especially nice for my daughter who is in 2nd grade and isn't quite at the point of being able to search online for songs herself. She can just ask Alexa to find a song and she is surprisingly accurate. Overall, this is a great product at a very reasonable price.  I found the Dot to be surprisingly loud on its own, but I did hook it up to a cheap portable speaker for my daughter to use when she is in the shower since it wasn't quite loud enough independently.

"Michelle L. Sullivan","April 20, 2017 ",5.0,"I seriously love this thing!  I use it mostly for music and other info such as news and weather. It has made my music listening experience so much better being able to verbally request music I want to hear, skip songs easily and also change the volume all without lifting a finger.  I even used it the other day when I was cooking to find out appropriate cooking temps for pork.  Loved that I didn't have to stop what I was doing to get the info I needed.  It is a super easy system to set up and I have yet to be disappointed.  It did take me a few tries to figure out how to ask for specific things such as getting to my playlists but once you figure it out there are no issues.  And if you can't remember what you said to get there, you can always go to the Alexa app and see it there.  I have it bluetoothed to my Bose system so the sound is great.  This is now my go to gift for the holidays. ",
HereRightNow,"January 31, 2017 ",5.0,"This is a nifty device that has many great features and is sometimes even more convenient that pulling out my phone to check something (which I didn't think was possible. I love the ability to get an assortment of music right at the sound of my voice, and also the Jeopardy! feature is a personal favorite that I play every morning. It's also very loud for a very small device (as much so as my large Bluetooth speaker). My own two sticking points that caused me to dock a star were the lack of portability (I thought you charged the device and took it anywhere, not have to leave it attached to the wall), and the particularness that it has when connecting with WiFi. I bought this for myself at college right after we upgraded our school-sponsored WiFi, but I ended up having to find another connection because the Echo Dot doesn't link up to encrypted WiFi, or even show it on the screen.

Everyday it's &#34;Alexa turn on the lights&#34; then she thinks for a minute and nothing happens, so then I say it again and by then it usually works. This happens with many things and the problem is absolutely with the echo and not the smart lights because most of the time the echo never responds. Hopefully amazon will make this product better, right now it seems to have quite a few glitches. ",
autumn,"April 20, 2017 ",4.0,"My kids like the echo dot.  It plays music, answers questions about the weather, and does addition/subtraction etc..

It also takes a little long for echo dot to answer questions.  I understand that it is impossible to answer all questions, but I expect echo dot will be able to answer a lot more than what it currently does.  At least, the programmers should collect the type of questions echo dot is not able to answer and then add more facts to their knowledge base.  Also, I am not sure why cannot echo dot parse information obtained through search engine (echo dot uses bing) to answer questions ",
SD,"March 1, 2017 ",2.0,"So many others have talked about how they use this product, you can find those reviews below.  Great youtube videos, too. I had no idea the product was so useful.  Here is one small thing no one talks about.  Alexa has &#34;cards&#34;, which tell you which requests were made and even leaves a recording of the request. The purpose is to keep track of whether &#34;Alexa&#34; accurately answered your request.  There were cards for things I knew I had never asked for.  Playing the request is how I foiund out that my nephew was asking for music, when I was away from home, that I wouldn't let him play while around.  HA!  You should have seen his eyes, too funny. Yes, it is  a little &#34;big brother&#34; at times, but great for keeping track of what your kids ask for when no one is looking. ;)  I bought the echo, loved it so much I purchased a multi-pack of dots to give to family for the holidays.

Dinnerplate,"April 2, 2017 ",3.0,"Alexa is pretty useless for the most part. She is good at telling me what time it is, setting a timer while cooking or an alarm. Half the time for music she doesn't know what you are asking for so its easier to just use my phone on a speaker. If you are buying the Dot because you want good sound quality through an external system its awful as well. For alexa to respond the system needs to be on, so you end up pluging and unpluging her from whatever.    She also uses bing for search which is literally the worst thing ever.    I also bought this to allow me to control caseta lights, which worked for about a month. Now alexa either tells me that the device doesn't support being turned off/on or that it didn't respond in time, as the lights do what I asked.    I'm going to try google home, it looks way more promising :/ ",
"Ashley B.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Great! Can do what the bigger one does (or so I hear) and we don't have any issues with the speaker being too quiet/not quality enough for what we're using it for. We use it for a variety of things but in a house with a 3-year old it is most often used as a kitchen, potty, or time-out timer- lol. We got it as a gift so I wouldn't have bought it myself just for that, but having a newborn on my hands it is so nice just to tell &#34;Alexa&#34; to play a song or start a timer for me. I'm sure with more time I will continue to learn how better to use the capabilities for further use. ",
"Carolyn A. Russell","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"We bought this device primarily for my 6 year-olds birthday because right now he's anxious about various animals and has been asking non-stop questions about them that I can't answer (and frankly, am really tired of trying to answer!). It did fine at playing music for us (which was the other feature we were looking to) but was very disappointing in terms of answering questions. It was unable to recognize my son's questions, and even when my husband and I asked, it said it didn't know the answer to almost everything we asked (it could tell us what whales and snakes ate. It couldn't answer questions about specific snakes and what they ate, it couldn't answer ANY questions about what sharks eat or if they eat people) and even the answers we DID get weren't all that detailed or specific (&#34;whales eat fish&#34;). This might be a great option for other people, but in terms of strictly answering questions and being informative, we were seriously let down. ",

I ask Alexa a ton of questions. I love the games she will play and stories she tells. My only complaint is that Alexa needs more personality, like the Google Home unit has (my folks have that one so I get to play with both). Other than that, the Echo rocks. I have it hooked up to my Smart Home system which allows me to use voice commands on certain functions of my house, which is totally awesome. ",
Friday,"January 22, 2017 ",3.0,"It is a fun little gadget.

The &#34;skills&#34; that you can add are very useful, I like the Twitter skill that can read me the latest tweets.  Alas, you can't compose tweets through this device. Also quite useful is the companion app for my Iphone.  When I ask the Echo Dot for some information that is a bit wordy (like &#34;how to cook a turkey&#34; ) it send that info to the Iphone. The alarm feature is useful but I am disappointed that it will not audibly alert you to any reminders .  I was able to link this device to Google Calendar and find that very helpful.

It turn on randomly, waking me up in the morning even. it is highly inaccurate in comparison to the Echo - Alexa misunderstands me. she's like a gf who just, after we got so comfortable, changed. She's wrong more than half the time. But maybe that all is user error - misplacement of the dot who knows. but technical errors like disconnecting from wifi are just unforgivable. The amazon echo never had that issue. the echo dot has poor volume. I can't even hear it all full blast from the other side of the 10x10 room when listening to the news. I have to say - dont buy the echo dot unless you are in a small bedroom and can put up with the constant wifi dropping. ",
Judy,"March 22, 2017 ",4.0,"How did I ever survive without Alexa? Haha this is great! I love having voice control over most things in my master bedroom. I use it with my speaker for music, and with a WeMo switch for my 2 lamps bedside.It was cheaper than buying the smart bulbs. The Echo Dot works just as described. I use it to set alarms, play music, voice volume control,  tell me jokes, & more, pretty soon I plan to voice order form amazon. I don't watch much tv or I'd invest in a smart remote and voice control that too! The set up was simple. I followed the little instruction card and was done within a couple minutes. VERY EASY, just plug it in, wait for the orange light, push one button & that's it! Alexa greets you. You can change the the code word to whatever you want. I like Alexa for now. When I get bored with it, I'll mix it up a little. Definitely recommend, get it, you'll love it. ",
Aerlpam,"January 16, 2017 ",2.0,"Received this right after Thanksgiving and have only scratched the surface as far as the Echo Dots capabilities.  Waking up during the night and asking Alexa for the time is neat and getting the weather first thing in the morning only makes me want to see what else I can do with this little wonder.  Glad I waited on the Dot vs buying the other Echo products.  Can see me buying one or two more Dots in the future to provide full household coverage.  Will probably wait awhile before adding any of the many 'works with Alexa' products coming onto the marketplace.  Find the sound of the Dot more than acceptable for most uses and casual listening to music.  One of my better recent purchases and certainly will be a great Christmas gift for the techie in the house.  Saying that, I think there will be more than a few Moms and Dads using the Dot once they experience how easy it is to use. ",
"Jessie J","December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"After all the hype I got one. I couldn't get it to work properly.  I was successful in getting it synched to the wifi once, just long enough for me to ask Alexa to tell us the weather. No, my service wasn't the issue, I connected several other devices to make sure.  I even did all the resets, made sure nothing else was connected to the wifi, etc., it just wasn't working out.    Then recently I'm reading all these reports about Alexa ordering $140 doll houses, and $162 of Christmas cookies for kids. And the cops wanting to review the recordings from a crime.  Ok, the doll house and cookies can be returned. Recording and helping with a crime - that's awesome!  BUT, what else is it recording.  I don't really care to have my private life come under possible scrutiny over Alexa.    I love technology, but this one just ain't gonna cut it for my house. ",
Edwin,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Man, I don't know what life was like before we got Alexa.  She makes our life easy.  She turns on and off all of our lights, our furnace, air conditioner, she even sets and changes the mood lights in our bedroom.  She is now my alarm clock, she plays music, and I used her a lot for new words as my talking dictionary.    Remember the days where you have to turn on your computer and Google something?  Well, now you can ask Alexa even if you just woke up from your bed like as her &#34;Alexa, what time is it?&#34;  You can even set an alarm for Alexa to wake you up in half an hour, or even play your favorite music.  I think what I like most about Alexa is that she has made my life that much easier especially when my hands are tied and I don't have a set of hands to turn on the lights, she can do that for me with a &#34;say a command!&#34;  I highly recommend you get one and once you do, you don't look back!!

McDade,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This is a cool little device. The sound quality when connected to my home stereo via the 3.5mm plug is surprisingly clear and balanced. My only critiques are:    - When a 3.5mm plug is inserted, the Dot's internal speaker is disabled. You then have two options: turn your stereo on or unplug from the jack. Neither of these are satisfactory because they require something manual which negates the purpose of this device. You should be able to verbally tell Alexa to disable 3.5mm jack which would enable the internal speaker. It's kind of silly to have to turn my stereo on just to hear the forecast.    - Alexa is not very good at doing Google-esque searches. It falls way behind Siri in that regard.    It's a good start but needs some more work to achieve it's true potential. I got it as a gift so I can't complain but maybe ver3 will address some of these obvious shortfalls. ",
Phoenecian,"February 1, 2017 ",5.0,"This is awesome. Growing pains aside, with app development and smart tech integration issues, this thing is great.

I imagine I am source of most product integration issues, as I learn to interact more efficiently with ALEXA. Music is worth the monthly fee, and occasionally I have speech request issues, and sometimes, its perfect every time. Next up will be landscape lighting, and house HVAC wifi vent registers, and eventually I want to integrate some form of video control through firestick, or Roku boxes.

"Brian Hankins","December 8, 2016 ",3.0,"Works as well as my Echo with a small positioning caveat.    Pros: Internal speaker is actually pretty good, just as others have said. I could use it by itself in most rooms where I mostly wanted to ask it things. Seemed to respond from across decent sized room of about 15'. Easily connects to Bluetooth speakers and the auxiliary cabled speakers.    Cons: If you connect it to a speaker and it is sitting  even a bit behind the speaker it seems to have trouble hearing you when something is playing. The best setup seemed to be Echo Dot on one end of the room and the speakers on the other side of the room. Actually those were the only two setups I tried but it responded to everything I threw at it in the latter scenario.    I plan to get more for my important rooms since I have smart home stuff hooked to them now, They need to make an outdoor one that looks like a flower pot or something for my porch. ",

I loved that it controlled the Christmas lights too. I was so impressed that I came back online and ordered another one for myself. I can't wait to start connecting my house too.    I currently use it to give me the weather and news reports every morning, play music, set timers, alarms and reminders. It took about an hour to setup but the Amazon Alexa app walked me through the process pretty easily once I downloaded it on my iphone.

Shutterbug35,"March 27, 2017 ",5.0,"We had the Google home and I ordered the Amazon Echo dot to compare. Of course the Google  product is more comparable to the upper end Amazon offering (Echo) rather than the Dot which is meant to be sprinkled around the house and lying in wait for questions. The ability to detect and interpret my accent was a little better with the Google home. Google also had more responsive answers. Still experimenting with the Dot. Its ability to recognize being called (&#34;Alexa!&#34;) is wonderful, especially when a roomful of conversations are in progress. The price is to kill for and the technology packed into it is phenomenal. Even if you were to buy a talking clock, thermometer, weather gauge and a general knowledge question-answer generator as well as a joke teller, a quiz creator, this product at $39.99 provide more value than you can ever imagine!

It would've been nice to have an AUX cord come with the devices as its kinda necessary for the product to sound good but also its kind of expected for you to hook it up to another speaker to, so that lost a few points for me, but over all its an excellent product and I would recommend it for everyone.

So far though she's been great at letting me know the weather, traffic conditions for my work commute, updates on my favorite sports teams, and of course playing music.

The suggestion in their last message seems to have worked (resetting it to the original factory settings).  The problem has not occurred again over the last 3 days.  Here's hoping. ",
"Phillip O.","January 30, 2017 ",5.0,"I returned my large Echo and purchased the Dot other than the speakers it works the same.  But the Echo's have their problems.  Greatly lacking in the information department.  You'll learn not to ask it general question because the response will be &#34;I can't find the answer to the question you ask&#34; or &#34;I don't...I can't...I'm not able&#34;.  So pair it with a great Bluetooth speaker and enjoy your amazon prime music ",
"Betty C","April 10, 2017 ",4.0,"got one for the shower room... I can listen to whatever music I request!  Everyone likes singing in the shower.. now you can sing along!!  It also makes getting ready go faster...I love this Dot... it doesn't take up much space but really puts out the music!!! Can't wait for summer.. I'm getting another one for out on the patio!!  nicer sound than my other sources!!  I like this for the Music and information available!!! ",
Andrew,"April 23, 2017 ",3.0,"This device is amazing, and I only have one complaint, and that is that if you ask this a simple question (ex: &quot;When was the first Mackintosh released?&quot;) Alexa will not give you the answer, but instead send you a Bing results link in the Alexa app. Other than that I love it! I would recommend this device to anybody. It's great waking up to a virtual assistant, and being able to turn on my lights and give me info, and what's happening. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 28, 2017 ",5.0,"I love my All-New Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black ... I use it in my bathroom to play my Amazon Steaming Music.  It is a perfect addition to my morning routine.  It makes it unnecessary to bring my bluetooth speaker and iPod into the bathroom.  I would recommend it for this purpose! ",
"John Grieggs","January 17, 2017 ",5.0,"Echo Dot is fairly cool when it works.  When it decides not to work, which seems rather random, it does it quietly, and you lose all control.  For example, right now, both of my Dots, in different rooms, light up and are clearly hearing me talk, but refuse to provide time, weather, or control over my alarms.  No error, just no working.  I've tried rebooting.  I can't tell what is wrong.  This is unacceptable for devices that are meant to control various facets of my house.  An Alexa device should never fail silently - it should either work, or tell me that it isn't going to work, preferably with some sort of descriptive error and estimate of when or how it might be fixed.  My internet connection and other devices are working fine - it isn't a connectivity issue.  I would NOT trust an Alexa device with anything important at this point.  If I can't trust it to tell me what time it is, why would I trust it to control my door locks, cameras, or thermostat?  I didn't give it a bottom rating but it is fairly cool when it works, but the unreliability and lack of error reporting make it a product I will not be recommending to my friends.  I do not trust it to wake me up in the morning, as it should based on my existing daily alarm, and am extremely annoyed that it will not allow me to adjust that alarm nor provide me with any status as to why that might be.

"Kindle Customer","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"When I first ordered this, I worried that it would just wind up being another useless gadget that would just sit on my desk.  Boy was I ever wrong about that!  This little thing is so good it makes you wonder how you got along without it,  My wife scowled when she first saw it because she thought it was just another gadget as well.  Now she is crazy about it and wants one for every room in the house.  Well worth every penny it cost and it has so many uses. Things I used to have to type in on my computer to check things like the weather, she provides by simply asking.  Now my wife and I are getting older and tend to forget a few things, but by asking Alexia to add it to one of our list, we no longer miss out.  I highly recommend this little jewel because I have had mine for three months and I am still finding ne uses for it. ",
optern15,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"It's okay. Two of us here and my partner can use this without issue. For me, I can speak &#34;Alexea&#34; and it wakes up but never hears what I've asked. I almost always have to ask him to speak to her on my behalf. Sort of defeats the purposes but oh well. I can talk to siri all day without issues but this thing can't hear me. I do like how easy it is to integrate with other apps, like WeMo. Not as locked down as Apple products are. ",
"Andrew Schutsky","January 3, 2017 ",5.0,"A cool little device - I originally purchased to use with my Wink for lighting control but I'm quickly finding new uses for it.  Didn't expect much more than a novelty at it's price point but it has been useful with traffic, weather, and for playing music which connects to my bluetooth speaker.  Maybe I'll buy one for downstairs as well? ",
"B. sindelar","April 2, 2017 ",3.0,"4 stars because of maddening setup.    VAST IMPROVEMENT over dot 1.  The original produced a mono signal that did not work as stereo with any of my receivers.  This one actually outputs stereo.    I have this setup in a studio/workshop hooked up to a yamaha receiver and 2 massive speakers.  I have all my music just a simple voice command away, and I dig that.  I know i am barely scratching the surface of what these things can do with my setup, but being able to yell at my music while I am elbow deep in a project is worth $49.99 to me! ",
BrianMac,"April 23, 2017 ",5.0,"Its difficult for me to give an Amazon product a negative review because I am such a big fan of Amazon but I purchased two of these, one for myself and one for my parents. My parents still have theirs and use it sparingly. I sent mine back. The biggest disappointment for me was that we hoped it would be more or less a &#34;Hey Google&#34; type device in that we could ask it questions and get answers. Unfortunately, it only answers certain types of questions. That being said, we currently not Amazon Prime subscribers and it may well function better if you are. Also, we do mot have a &#34;smart home&#34; so we were not attempting to access that functionality. May parents basically utilize it as a weather radio as they are not Amazon Prime members either. If you are not a Prime member, it requires you to set up a utilize other  apps in order to complete any tasks. ",
"Jessica L. Bennett","October 25, 2016 ",4.0,"I've loved my Echo for a while now, but my husband noticed I would move it around the house to listen to Pandora so he bought me the Dot for Christmas.  My only complaint (that's not a real complaint) is it might be too sensitive because sometimes I set the Echo and the Dot off at the same time and they answer me in surround sound.  If you have an Echo, I highly recommend adding on a Dot or two depending on the size of your house.  I use mine for random stuff all the time like asking about the time or the weather. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 16, 2016 ",3.0,"I like the Echo Dot.  I already had a Bose speaker to hook it up to so I didn't need the full Echo.  It is useful to ask questions about the weather or to turn on our hue lights and other lights hooked up to our WeMo plugs.  I only give it 4 stars because Amazon needs to improve the number of &#34;skills&#34; it has and to partner with more home automation companies like Sonos.  Its ability to interact with Nest and our separate Honeywell Wifi thermostat are limited at best.  Also the AI could use some tweaking... like this morning I kept asking about how windy it was going to be or what the projected wind speed would for the day (it was supposed to be very windy) and Alexa kept just telling me the forecast over and over.  Obviously she understands I am asking about the weather (&#34;wind&#34; apparently = &#34;weather&#34; to her) but does not understand that I am asking particular information.  Other times she will directly respond like when I asked specifically if there was any snow in the forecast.  If she can't answer it that's fine, but she should say so instead of just repeating the same answer.    Again, its a work in progress and I am sure it will get better as time does on.  I would recommend you do your research and figure out the home automation products that appear to work best with Alexa/Echo before you pull the trigger. ",
"Aaron Thompson","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"The voice recognition ability is amazing, and the Amazon Echo team is constantly improving things behind the scenes. Alexa's voice is very pleasant and easy to understand, despite the size of the Dot. Sound quality can easily be improved through the 1/8&#34; stereo jack or by pairing with Bluetooth devices. The light ring is a great way to confirm you were heard. From a kid who grew up with Speak & Spell, the Echo Dot definitely shows how far technology has come. Definitely recommended to any techie out there. $50? What are you waiting for? ",
"Tyler Forge","December 16, 2016 ",4.0,"Hey - its and Echo Dot. Yay!    I was an early adopter f the full size Echo and wanted the same capability in more rooms of the house. This dot works pretty good and does most of what I want. To be clear - this is a fantastic device at a great price.    Here is what you -won't- get.    It ain't loud. The full size echo can wake the dead. The dot, even at its loudest, can be easily drowned out by the TV. Sure, you can pair a bluetooth speaker to it, but why? If you need the volume, just get the full size echo and be done with it.    It doesn't share tasks with the other Echo. If I want a timer or alarm to sound from both, I have to tell them both. Then I have to tell them both to shut up. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Dunno.    Regardless, Alexa will change you life. Jump in. ",
"T. Sheridan","March 24, 2017 ",5.0,"I liked my tap, now I love the dot. I have the tap in my office because I am always on conference calls, I didn't want it to have any &#34;false alarms.&#34; I added the Dot to the family room and use it most often to control the lights, thermostat, and other devices around the house. It's also useful for random questions while watching movies, such as bios on actors or &#34;Is so-and-so dead or alive?&#34;  The voice recognition is very good, but you do need to practice a bit to be understood consistently.
