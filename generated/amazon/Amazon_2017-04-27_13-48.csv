"Roy Estaris","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.  Happy Holidays  Roy ",
DJ,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.    If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!    Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.    1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.    2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.    3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, &#34;Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees&#34; got no result, so I tried &#34;Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees&#34; and she picked it up perfectly.    4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.    5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  &#34;Alexa, play 90s music&#34;, &#34;Alexa, play indie music&#34;, and &#34;Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds&#34;.  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great &#34;freebie&#34; if you're a prime member.    6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.    7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.    8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to &#34;Alexa, what's the definition of&#34;, &#34;Alexa, how far away is&#34;, &#34;Alexa, Wikipedia&#34; (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask &#34;Alexa, tell me more&#34;).  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.    9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).    Suggestions for Improvement:    1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like &#34;How far away is the sun&#34; but I'd really like too see Amazon add a &#34;search&#34; function.    2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.    3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings. ",
"Bryant R.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.  A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.  So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.  The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.  I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.  Thanks for letting me rant ",
RaVen,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!  This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say &#34;alexa&#34; and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.    We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its &#34;multi-room voice recognition&#34; technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word &#34;alexa&#34; on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a &#34;multi-device&#34; plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited      The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.  The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.    At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is &#34;alexa turn on the lights&#34; and our downstairs lights spring into action.    My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with &#34;sorry I didn't get that&#34;  Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.    Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your &#34;free&#34; music.    I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up &#34;New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing&#34; under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.    I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device. ",
"Brian C","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.    I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.    My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo &#34;skills&#34; that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the &#34;skills&#34; not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.    Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.    The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached. ",
Andrew,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"This was my first Echo purchase and I am overall very pleased with it's performance. Initially, I was worried that it was going to be a Siri knockoff with only a limited number of voice commands and functions with constant errors; however, I have not received single error response since I have owned it. I am an Amazon Prime member and from the time I clicked confirm purchase to the time it was delivered to my doorstep only took 3 days, and best part of all, shipping was free.    I currently have mine sitting by my bed and have synced it with the app, available on for all phone types, which allows me to carry out a number of voice commands including: &#34;Alexa, set an alarm for..., check the weather, play Pandora, or tell me a joke.&#34; The app interface is a little clunky at times, but you're able to see the history of recent requests, and Alexa is constantly learning and adapting to your specific commands and style.    If you are looking to buy an Echo Dot because you want a cheap introduction into Bluetooth connectivity with household lights, televisions, gaming systems, thermostats, or other Echo products then buy this Echo Dot. I am working with a grad student budget, and for $50 dollars this sleek and sexy &#34;command station&#34; was worth every penny. I did not receive any compensation for this review, I am writing it because I debated on buying one for about a week before pulling the trigger, and I just want to speed up the process for people like me who may be waffling...trust me, its completely worth the $50.

"Amazon Customer","December 14, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly, I love mine but obviously, there are some things that could be better. What do I love about it? Both my boyfriend and I downloaded the app and have access to a shopping list that we can both use at the grocery store depending on who is there. With a simple wake up word (her name) and the command of adding an item to the shopping list, it appears in the app. I can ask for a flash briefing and NPR news is retrieved and I am caught up all over the world in subjects from politics all the way to sports news. She also gives great weather information so that I am able to plan for my day ahead. Alexa can learn many skills that continue to evolve. Knowledge from what wines to pair with what meats and good cooking substitutes to helping with a drinking game and other games & trivia. Alexa comes in handy when I need a hands-free timer in the kitchen or an alarm for a nap. Now, what I don't really like but can get passed it once I get the hang of it. Sometimes you ask a question but she doesn't understand the question but you reword the question and she is able to understand it. So just be sure your wording the question correctly. Also, remember that Alexa is always listening. ",
"Kathryn H.","March 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Love the Echo Dot. I got the buy 3 discount, which makes it worth while. I am sure there will be more things added and improved on in time, but so far it is a bit limited in what I can use it for. We don't have a modern set up in our house so that it can adjust lights or temp so that part is useless to us.  I got it mostly for my 93 year old mother whom I take care of, as she constantly asks me what day or time it is, so now she can ask the Echo. I also like the ability to get a weather report for the day, and I still need to set up the calendar for daily events for mom, once I get that set up it will be another great advantage in having this. I hope they can come up with a way to make this an intercom also between rooms so that if she needs me at any time Echo can alert me in some way. That alone would make this a really great item worth five stars.  So far my favorite feature is the radio, I just ask it to play a particular type of music and it comes on. You do have to be specific about how to get the type of music you want to hear rather than just ask it to play a particular genre. I also like that you can vocally tell it to turn down or up the volume, and to skip the song playing and it goes to the next one. I don't use it to shop with, might be helpful to some. Also, it does take a little adjusting to the way some people speak, my voice is clear but moms is a little muffles so it took a few times of asking questions to get it use to her voice, now it works good for her. The distance to where it can hear you is good and volume on answering and music is great, you don't really need added speakers unless you want to hear it over a very large room, or whole house.  Pros: Received quickly with free Prime shipping, ability to play music, ask for date, time, and weather without touching anything, get answeres to a lot of questions, and the ability to update and improve over time. Volume is great for small to medium size rooms, and several feet away form it. Great price for 3.  Cons: Still some limitations, no intercom set up yet, need to be specific about where to get radio from. ",
Vince,"April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I have the regular Echo and it's amazing. I bought the Echo Dot for my dad who had been using a little antenna radio around the house. This isn't mobile but it allows him to play Pandora or just to tell it what kind of music to play. It was purchased through my account but I created an Amazon account for him so I could link Pandora to it. That way he has his own Pandora account. Echo can switch accounts at any time with a voice command but we keep them on the primary users' account. I was worried the audio quality wouldn't be any good based on reviews but it's really not bad at all if you're replacing a little radio. It's not audiophile fill the room with brilliance quality, but it gets the music out and doesn't sound tinny or anything. My dad really enjoys it. ",
"Marquino Gadget guru","April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"This is what I`ve been waiting for!!!!  It is simple amazing what you can do with technology nowadays, Amazon is always innovating and staying on top with technology.  This new Amazon Echo Dot does what it says it does and provides all the necessary information by simply asking!  We like it to much i got a second device to add it in my room, been able to connect to your Bluetooth speakers and devices you can automate lots of things.  Great job Amazon ",
Aphonic,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"The far field mic in the second gen do the is way better than the full size echo.  Now if they could just use a source for weather that was even remotely accurate I'd be happy.  Accuweather is ten degrees off a tank my location always. Minimum.  The dot works well.  It's a good cheap way to get alexa.  The speaker quality is fine for audio books and news briefings. Not for music.  It seems faster to respond than the full size echo (1st generation). I believe it's a better option to buy this and pair a nice bt speaker than buy the full echo st this point.  One star off for missing some basic features.  Like accurate weather and basic google searching.  It's useful for my home automation but I still  Find the echo line of products of very limited use outside of that.  Good for a kitchen timer or wake up  Alarm.  Good for some news.  Needs much better podcast management to be very useful.  Oh yah. And accurate weAther.  Amazon prime music is a. Nice touch as is music unlimited for the echo at $3.99 a month. ",
"LUCY  Von","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I got Dot about a week after the big Echo from my son as a gift. We set her up and all was fine. Until nothing eas fine anymore 😢 . She would respond initially, but not always though, and when she was playing music she would not respond to the wake word. At all. I reset, few times, but nithing worked. I called Amazon. Within minutes they had me connected to Echo's tech support, and in no time did we have Dot fixed. They reset her factory settings with me. We tested and now our darling little Dot is happy and healthy! So call Amazon if you do have issues, it's a matter of setup or wifi or in any case, something that they can fix. Wonderful support for a wondrful device. I do wish I could call her Dot though. Or a name that I choose. Because now I have two Alexa's in one household 🤔, and calling her Echo or Amazon ain't gonna work for me 😢. Please vote my review up if you liked it. ",
"Kindle Customer","April 20, 2017 ",4.0,"EDIT: All thanks to Amazon's customer service, I learned why my Echo was not working. It must be 8&#34; -12&#34; away from a wall. Our Echo Dot works when against an interior wall but not against an exterior wall where it had previously been situated. We adore &#34;Alexa&#34; and hope the Echo Dot will soon add a great speaker to its features. For the price, this is a fantastic device. And, it's diminutive size makes it easy to use. Still, our family prefers full-size Echo. Thanks, Amazon for the email help with Echo Dot!  *****  We are an Amazon device family. And, with the exception of this device, have had wonderful experiences.    Echo Dot remains connected until the next time I use it. Literally, I reconnect Echo Dot to our network, ask it a few questions, play some music, walk away. When I return Echo has spontaneously disconnected itself and requires the reconnection procedure again.    We have two full size Echos and have no connection issues with them. They operate flawlessly. ",
"Lantana Al","January 11, 2017 ",5.0,"Amazon Echo is a great device (I was one of the first to have one and waiting for months for my first Echo to ship as Amazon vastly underestimated the demand for a device like this) and the Echo Dot (2nd generation) is fantastic in its size and capability (I bought a six pack to get one free). There is no volume ring on the 2nd gen Dot like there is on the original Echo and the 1st gen Echo Dot but it's no big deal as there are volume buttons now and the cost of the volume ring wasn't worth it if you ask me (it was nice, but for most people not worth the money). Most of the time you'll want to adjust the volume by voice anyway (like &#34;Alexa volume 5&#34;). The 2nd gen Echo Dot is also available in white but I'm sticking with black. UPDATE: I actually prefer the cheaper volume buttons on the Dot 2 to the volume ring now.    The fact that you can just talk from across the room and it can hear you (most of the time) really sets this apart. If you think you already have an Echo because you have Siri, Cortana, or Google, then know that it's just not the same.    Things I do: set timers, set alarms, get weather info, ask basic questions, listen to music (like Prime Music, Prime Stations, songs I bought, etc), listen to radio, ask for jokes, turn things on and off, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some things. The Echo really excels at playing music. I love it than I can ask for a song I want to hear and it will play it (most of the time anyway). At night I often listen to a local radio station and I just say &#34;Alexa stop&#34; without having to get out of bed when I want to stop listening.    When I listen to Prime Station I can tell it &#34;thumbs up&#34; if I like the song or &#34;thumbs down&#34; if I don't... and when I listen to the station again it won't play the songs that I've thumbed down.    Using the built-in speaker, the sound quality is decent for voice. For music you'll want to connect it to a speaker system because the Dot's small internal speaker is weak. I do wish I could AirPlay to a device from the Echo when I'm playing music and want the best sound quality, however Bluetooth is pretty impressive when it uses the near-CD quality codecs.    Positives:  * The new feature that Amazon added (ESP - Echo Spatial Perception) so that the nearest Echo responds is fantastic. I was also very happy to hear that the first generation Echoes will also support this in the next firmware update (I think devices are updating now). From my research, if the Echo app shows that you have a device software version greater than 4008 then you should have the update with ESP support. Unfortunately there does seem to be a minor downside: the Echo's response can sometimes be slightly delayed while multiple Echoes figure out which Echo is closest and should respond.  * It seems to hear better when playing music than the first gen. It was annoying when you would try to talk to it while it was playing but it couldn't hear you. The new Dot hears better during music playback but it's still not &#34;Star Trek quality&#34; hearing; sometimes you may still need to raise your voice.  * It's relatively cheap and well worth the asking price.  * It has a 3.5mm stereo audio jack, which I use with two of my Dots to connect to the line-in on one of my computers and another to the line-in on an old compact stereo/CD player. Sound quality should be good enough for anyone except audiophiles.  * Some people complain of connection issues, but all of my Echoes stay connected without issue to my&nbsp;Asus RT-AC68U&nbsp;router.  * If you want to 'Wikipedia' something then you can say 'Alexa, Wikipedia &#60;subject&#62;'. She'll read a little from Wikipedia. If you want her to read more after she stops then just say 'Alexa, tell me more'. This can be useful sometimes.    Negatives (mostly minor but take note):  * Warranty is only 90 days. I think it should be 1 year. Of course they will sell you a SquareTrade 1, 2, or 3 year warranty for $5/year if you want. Perhaps another cost-cutting move.  * The shiny (glossy) black surface can be a fingerprint magnet but you probably won't be touching it often. The previous generation wasn't glossy.  * I had trouble configured my 2nd Echo Dot (the first one went fine). The Alexa app (on Android) gave me the cryptic message &#34;Authorization expired. Please reconnect your phone to the internet, log out from the app and retry&#34;. Got it several times. I resolved it by signing out of the Alexa app and then signing back in, having to re-enter my email and password.... annoying... and I wonder why I didn't have this issue setting up my first Echo Dot just minutes prior???? Oh well. UPDATE: This just happened again on another day when setting up two more Echo Dots. This first Echo Dot setup went fine, but on the second one I got the &#34;Authorization expired.&#34; message again. Beware of this issue if setting up more than one Echo Dot.  * While trying out Amazon Music Unlimited with the Echo I immediately ran into the issue of the Echo playing the explicit version of songs instead of the clean version. There should be an option to never play explicit songs and to play the clean version instead (some people have children). The workaround until Amazon addresses this problem is to add the clean song to your music library and then say &#34;Alexa play &#60;song&#62; from my library&#34;.  * This doesn't affect me, but the Echo does not support enterprise networks that require centralized network authentication with a login. Some might want to know this (like teachers who might want to use it in a school that uses this type of network authentication).  * The Android Amazon Alexa app can be slow and frustrating sometimes. For example, when launching it sometimes just sits there on the intro screen and spins forever until you shut down the app and restart it again.  * Doesn't hear well in a noisy environment, or when other people (including on TV) are talking at the same time.    Home Automation:  * I use several&nbsp;Belkin WeMo&nbsp;switches to control some lights and fans. They work pretty well although not always perfectly. Fortunately they work better now after all the firmware updates.  * I can control my Honeywell WiFi thermostats using the &#34;Honeywell Total Connect Comfort&#34; skill. I have two downstairs for 2 zones. I have one&nbsp;Honeywell RTH9580WF1005/W1&nbsp;and one&nbsp;Honeywell RTH6580WF.  * I recently set it up to turn on and off certain activities with a&nbsp;Logitech Smart Hub. For example, I can say &#34;Alexa, turn on TiVo&#34; and it will turn on the TV and my receiver and set the TV and receiver inputs correctly. I can then use the remote which is synced... and turn it all off with &#34;Alexa turn off TiVo&#34;. There were some annoyances getting it all setup but I think it's pretty &#34;cool&#34; even though you can only start and stop activities with Alexa so you still need the remote to do other things (change channel, adjust volume, mute, pause, etc).  * I think I've only really scratched the surface of what is possible with home automation. I have not tried IFTTT (&#34;if this then that&#34;) recipes yet but I hear it is quite powerful and hope to try it out when I have more time to &#34;play&#34;.    Wishes:  * High-quality digital audio output that is better than Bluetooth. If it had this then you could really get high quality audio output from it, but most people probably don't really care that much as analog out is &#34;good enough&#34;.  * Smarter. After 2 years I wish the Echo was smarter. Yes, it has definitely improved over time but Google can still answer more questions than Alexa. It's going to be hard to beat Google in answering general questions.  * Weather alerts. I suggested this a long time ago and they still haven't added it... perhaps due to legal reasons? If would be great if it would sound some sort of alarm or notification for severe weather.  * Built-in support for notifying others that you might need help. This would be good for the elderly. There is a &#34;Ask My Buddy&#34; skill however, but the verbiage is a little awkward (&#34;Alexa, Ask My Buddy to Send Help&#34;) and it's free so if the developer decides to stop support then that might leave a lot of people without service at an inopportune time.    Compared to Google Home (which I just bought):  * Setup on Google Home was super-simple, easier than Echo (the Android app worked really well and setup seemed streamlined)  * Google Home is smarter for general questions... significantly smarter. I asked Google &#34;How long does it take to get to the Honda dealer in Lewisville&#34; and it told me about 26 minutes in current traffic conditions. Awesome. The Echo totally failed here.  * No AUX audio output like on Echo Dot  * I prefer saying &#34;Alexa&#34; to &#34;OK Google&#34; as the wake word (UPDATE: &#34;Hey Google&#34; works now too!)  * I currently prefer Echo for music and smart home control but I consider Google Home a serious threat to Echo because it is more &#34;intelligent&#34; than Echo    Other:  * It doesn't come with a 3.5mm audio cable but I can understand why as many people would probably not use it and Amazon wants to get the cost as low as possible so this isn't a big deal.  * The USB power cable is about 5 feet.  * The 1st gen Echo Dot was almost double the price. I feel a little disappointed that they now have a 2nd gen that is overall better for much less money... and that it came out very shortly after the 1st gen Echo Dots.  * You don't need any other Echo units to use the Dot... some people might think you do but this is just like the &#34;big Echo&#34;, only without the &#34;big&#34; sound. Instead a little speaker is included.  * It's USB powered and comes with a USB power adapter and USB cable. NOTE: If you use a USB power connection other than from the included power adapter then there could be power and/or sound quality issues. I had some sound quality issues (background noises) and eliminated them by switching to the included USB power adapter.  * About 10 or 15 minutes after setting it up, it said something like &#34;your Echo received an important update and must restart&#34;. So if you are having issues with it then you may want to give it awhile so it can update if needed.  * For better understanding of what you say, go to the Alexa app and Settings-&#62;Voice Training.  * I bought some of these powered bookshelf speakers, hooked them to the Echo Dot, and have been impressed with what you get for the money:&nbsp;Edifier R1280T Powered Bookshelf Speakers    While not perfect, I really like the Amazon Echo. I think the technology and potential is still in its infancy but the Echo is already really useful and excels at home automation, playing music, podcasts, and radio. Highly recommended, especially for the price. UPDATE: I'm reducing my rating from 4.5 to 4 stars due to Google Home being much smarter at answering general questions. The Echo is a good device but I think you should also seriously consider Google Home. ",
Artemaria,"April 13, 2017 ",4.0,"At first, I thought that this would just be like a voice-controlled Siri that is always on, but  after living with it for several months it seems as if it is so much more.  While not perfect, the speech recognition and accuracy are on a par with Google Assistant, and that accuracy along with the &#34;instant on&#34; feature is what makes this so easy to use.  The literature is not the clearest on this, but you don't really need a speaker for the Echo Dot, and we usually don't use it with the speaker, because the built in speaker is more than loud and clear enough for Alexa's speaking voice in the 20 x 16 room where we have it stationed.  If you want to play music and have the music sound rich and full, then you should hook it up to a nice Bluetooth speaker.  We use the Logitech Boom and it works very well, usually pairing flawlessly with the Echo Dot with very little effort, and great sound.    What makes the Echo Dot a little different and perhaps more fun to use than its competitors are the &#34;skills&#34; that are built into it.  I'm not going to go into the details of all the things that it can do because you can read about them on c/net or some other tech site, but what I will tell you is that there are alot of &#34;skills&#34; that are not at all pragmatic or useful, but that make the Echo Dot/Alexa alot more fun than the competition.  There's a storytelling feature, where Alexa will tell you a not so great bedtime story.  But what makes it so engaging are the thoughtfully interspersed comments in that story, such as &#34;no, you can't get any water,&#34; and &#34;that's your last story, and its time for you to go to sleep,&#34; which seem so human and so clever.  The Echo Dot/Alexa also will tell you the news, the weather and instantaneously provide any other current-events related information that you may want to hear while cooking dinner or getting dressed for work.    Along, these same lines, Alexa will tell you a joke, and will answer questions about various topics including about other AI platforms which she does in a polite and diplomatic fashion with a response like &#34;I like all AIs.&#34;  In reality, however, this is not true.  Neither Alexa, nor Google Assistant, nor Siri are true AIs.  They are merely the latest in voice recognition hardware and software that, through brute force algorithm calculations performed on a server far from your home, determines a high-probability acceptable response to the combination of words that served as its verbal input.  Because Alexa is cannot make any decisions on its own, it is not a true AI.  Thus, if your internet service is slow or off, Alexa will not work, leaving you with a $50 paperweight.  We've not had that issue, but it is something to consider if your internet service is not the best and you are considering buying this device.    In the end, this is a fun foray in to the world of voice-activated assistants.  And while Amazon's database of verbal input grows, paving the way for a true AI someday, Alexa may be the recognized as one of the first pioneering digital assistant devices that trained people to verbally interact with technology in their home.

NC-Ron,"October 24, 2016 ",4.0,"My wife and I had thought about getting Dots for the grand kids for Christmas but the reviews at that time were incomplete and confusing about what the dot would do and how they might interact/interfere with each other in the same household.  Well, we now own an Echo, a Tap and two Dots. They are all great.    Myth 1.  You do NOT need Echo to use a Dot. Dot is autonomous. It responds to Alexa commands just like Echo, and can control remote devices just as well.    Myth 2. You MUST have external speakers. Not so. The speaker in Dot is no great shakes, but it works. The audio output to a good set of powered speakers is great.    Myth 3. If you use Echo, or Dot or Tap, you cannot have two or more doing different things. Not so. I can have Alexa via Echo playing Clapton in the living room and have Alexa via Dot playing the Dead in the bedroom, at the same time, with just one Amazon Prime account, not even the Prime Music account.    Other:  Both Dot and Echo have to be plugged into 115 v all the time to work. The Tap is rechargeable and bluetooth so it is portable. Great feature. We use Echo and Dot to control TP-Link smart plugs and smart switches. They work great. (I love the TP-Link stuff, maybe another review. But Alexa at my house can control the smart stuff at our beach place 250 miles away. In fact you have to be precise in your language with Alexa or she'll be turning stuff on and off in the other location...)    I actually haven't tried the Tap yet with remotes (it's at the beach and I'm not), but I assume it will work just as well. The only caveat is that you have to 'enable remote' on the smart plugs, etc. in order to have Alexa turn them on and off. Some folks are leery about doing that. If I get hacked and some clown wants to turn off my bedroom light, so be it. (I can monitor the status of all the smart devices with the KASA app for TP-Link and my smart phone.)    Dot is a little bigger than a hockey puck and makes a great alarm clock. ",
ComputerGuy,"April 26, 2017 ",5.0,"For $50 and what it does, how can you go wrong? Answer is, you can't. This thing is awesome. Not a whole lot bigger than a hockey puck. With all the power of the Full Sized Echo less the better speaker. Since you can pair with a Blue Tooth Speaker or plug it in via cable which the full unit currently doesn't, there's really no downside to this thing. Setup in minutes, new skills easily added. 2 Million songs available if you have Amazon Prime. I've got it controlling a Smart LED Bulb I purchased a few days after I received the Echo Dot. I purchased a second one for my brother who's Bed Ridden in a care facility and he loves it. He's a Trivia and Facts Buff so he went to town using it to search Wikipedia for all sorts of info. He's also using it to play his favorite Radio Station.    If you are interested in this device, ignore the low rating reviews. The speaker is fine, yes it's small and not super powerful but there is no quality issue with it. It's like using a small portable radio (not a boombox). If you're an Audiophile or need loud music, hook it up to a stereo or high end Bluetooth speaker, don't trash it because it won't shake your windows with the built in speaker.    It's sound pickup is fine as well. I put one upstairs in my house and it can hear me from other rooms upstairs just fine. Unless you are talking like a mouse or have it blasting music or something making it hard for it to pickup your voice. I purchased a second for my downstairs part of the house and with it centrally located, I've got the entire house covered with 2 and it's always within range of my voice. My Girlfriend has a slight speech issue and it understands her fine too.    I may buy a 3rd to dedicate to my Home Entertainment center and plug it into the stereo. I should have purchased 3 with the promotion of getting $20 for buying 3, but I wanted to test one out first. In any case, even without the Buy 3 promotion, you still come in under the $176 for the Full echo. I don't have the full Echo so I can't compare, but from everything I've read, and what i've experienced with my Dots, I see nothing wrong with them and feel they are a major margin. And I don't feel the need to get the full unit at this point just to have a better speaker. ",
Manders,"March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"I like the Dot quite a bit, but it could be better. I'm not sure if it is the ALEXA program that the Dot connects to or if it is the Bing Search engine, I will have to do some more testing. Some times it can't find info it should be able to. Playing Music works Great!!! The Built in speaker is OK. But if you connect it to a really good speaker with either an Audio Cable or Bluetooth it sounds Great!! I am having the Dot read a Kindle book to me. It works well but the inflections in the text to speech program need work. However that is not a limitation of the device but of current technology. Getting local weather or movies works well. Alexa can &#34;learn&#34; other &#34;Skills&#34; but you have to tell Alexa to use the skill. It would be better if these skills were available all the time, and didn't have to be &#34;turned on&#34;. The Dot does not have a battery, so if you unplug it, it will need to search and connect to your WIFI again when you plug it back in. A great work around is to get a small battery pack (needs a least a 1 amp output port) and keep it plugged into the battery pack and then plug the battery pack into a wall charger. This allows the Dot to be truly portable. I had mine in my shirt pocket and was listening to a book while putting up Christmas lights outside for at least two hours. The Dot works Great, I am hoping that Alexa herself will get smarter. ",
Dion,"April 24, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought 16 of these and gave most of them out as Christmas presents. When I bought my first one in 2015 I was impressed with the questions I asked and the responses I received. These past 5 months or so I believe Alexia must have gone in for a lobotomy. Seldom understands the question. Upgraded to the Prime Music. For how large they say the music library is, I have it ask an average of 3 times before it sometimes plays the song I requested. Yes you can load all sorts of &#34;skills&#34; but they need to come up with a way to allow you to print or even e-mail the skills and commands to yourself. ",
"Bryan Warren","December 15, 2016 ",5.0,"So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable. Here's the basics. Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power. On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use. Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables.

william,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.    Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.    Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it. ",
"Chris Hockaday","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Biggest piece of junk ever. It worked great for 1 day.

I've googled everything I can think of to try but nothing works.  I get that stuff doesn't always work perfectly and has issues, but the biggest problem is that there is no customer support.

Yes, the new Fire Stick is Alexa-enabled, but I'd prefer one listening device rather than two.    I considered the Google product and chose the Amazon Echo instead. While Google may have better search capabilities, I'm pretty well covered between phone and computers.

TwistedTree,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Lasted just about 6 months, then started failing. We would give a command, and the dot would sit and think about answering. Stops in the middle of playing music.

Ask it to tell us a joke, it tells the joke, but stops before giving the punch line. We have a full size echo that works fine, and we have tried moving the dot next to the echo to see if it was having issues with the wifi range, no change. Reset to factory defaults and setup from scratch, no change. We finally contacted tech support, who where useless. Bounced us around to 4 different techs in less then 5 minutes, where hung up on then finally told the case would be escalated to tier 2 support.

I am a apple product geek but I do like giving all types of gadgets a try, so I can be more informed and well rounded. This is why I took advantage of getting this Echo Dot at the monthly payments that amazon offers.    First I had no idea it was sooo tiny. Despite that it has big sound, and if I chose to have it louder I would attach it to my bluetooth speakers.    I plugged it in, and downloaded the Alexa app to my iPhone. It was a bit complicated to get it attached (it took me about 2 minutes which I didn't like) but I suppose if I read the directions more carefully it would have been faster.    Alexa works so well. I put her in my bedroom. Just telling her to speak, set my alarm, turn on my favorite radio station is so easy.    Siri is the number one girl in my life, but Alexa has a special place in my heart.

"Amazon Customer","January 23, 2017 ",4.0,"I use the echo mainly for playing music and it is not very good at that. It has trouble finding songs that are otherwise available.

Alexa, next track, Alexa, next track . . . lo and behold, 5 more &#34;next tracks&#34; later and Black and Blue is playing. Alexa stop. Well, Alexa might stop or you might have to say stop 3 more times. And even if it stops, it might randomly start playing again which is very annoying if you are on a phone call. Or you say &#34;next track&#34; and it goes silent and is thinking and then it just continues playing the track it was on. I don't have a speech impediment. Voice text on my phone understands what I say. I don't know why this stupid hockey puck can't. And god forbid you want to play a classical piece. I have a lot of classical music in my library and it won't play by composer or artist. I have to use the app to play almost any classical music in my library which defeats the purpose of the echo. I may as well just play it on the computer.  We use the jeopardy skill and play daily. No problems there. Once in a while I listen to the news or radio stations and it is pretty good at that, but again, switching stations may work the first time you ask or it may not. Very frustrating to have to keep barking &#34;play NPR&#34; and then it just continues playing 80s playlist. I would not recommend this to someone who would use it mostly for music. ",

I saw the Echo Dot as a low-cost entry point where I could salvage a good sounding compact speaker system AND dip my toe into home automation without spending a fortune. Next year? Who knows, but for right now the Echo Dot was exactly what I was looking for. ",
Juan,"March 21, 2017 ",3.0,"I have multiple conditions. Because of them me am nonverbal and not able to type. I use a eyegaze device or sometimes a switch. But it's stil hard. With all the devices you can talk to now it can really help me because I can program a button on my aac to speak the entire phrase. However Siri and google and Cortana all have problems understanding my 'voice' and there's not much I can do to change it. After seeing a YouTube video of someone else using the Tobii Dynavox I 15+ (AAC device) with the Echo I decided to test it myself. First I got the Alexa app to see what she can do and tried the swift for Alexa app to see if it understood me. After a great success I got the dot. It's really helped me. Not only can she do important stuff like help with ordering and looking stuff up and controlling smart stuff, she's like a friend to me. Her skills have things like storytelling and even games. I spend a lot of time stuck on my bed alone unable to move more than a finger if that but fully awake. Between the new eyegaze device and the echo dot I'm able to have more fulfilling life. ",
jford40,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"I really want to like the Dot. I got it on Black Friday so at the price I couldn't resist. I did not get it to control smart switches or the temperature or anything like that. I got it mostly because my parents have the original Echo and this seems like the same thing in a smaller form. A few of my opinions and reactions to other reviews:    - I am not sure why there are so many complaints about the speaker volume in this?? I have it in my living room and no matter where I am in the room I can hear Alexa just fine. In fact, most times I don't have the volume set above level 5. I don't know what others are doing that they say it is hard to hear, but for me I have zero issue with that!!    - I knew it was small, but this thing is like the size of a coaster. I find that to be a plus because it can go basically anywhere and not even be seen if you prefer.    - Set up and syncing with Wi-Fi was incredibly simple and I have had no issue since then.    - I am slightly disappointed at what appears to be limitations on the Dot's vocabulary or word recognition. Alexa far too often confuses what I say, or is unable to provide answers to questions that should be easy to answer    - The Alexa skills through the Alexa app are nice ways to add capabilities to your Dot, but I don't like how you then have to remember a different phrase for each individual skill you have enabled. I wish that enabling a skill became part of the Dot's natural interaction instead of having to identify it by stating the skill you want it to do.    - Alexa is very useful in many ways. She is very good at math which my daughter found out doing her homework one day. Being able to call for an Uber or look things up on Wikipedia is fantastic. Getting the daily news in the morning, playing some Jeopardy, hearing the weather, or setting an alarm is great as well. I really like adding things to my to-do list. What is interesting is that Alexa's vocabulary does not seem stifled for this task as she will add verbatim whatever you say.    - Alexa only Prime deals is another added benefit, although I have yet to actually find a deal I want to take advantage of I know that there have been some in the past that were truly great deals and only available with an Alexa enabled device.    The final thing I will say is that I am glad that there is the ability to change the &#34;wake word&#34; from Alexa. For a few days I could not understand why it seemed like Alexa was talking when I would speak to my daughter. It finally dawned on me that when I would say my daughter's name, Alyssa, sometimes Alexa would interpret that as me saying Alexa!! She would also respond at times if the TV commercial for the Dot came on so just an fyi that her hearing can be sensitive!! Overall I think this is a fun gadget to have. I hope that it will continue to evolve in it's capabilities and that eventually it will do many more things without having to search for a specific skill to add to enable it to do things. ",
"Anthony E Forney","March 31, 2017 ",4.0,"Not what I expected. This is not &#34;OK GOOGLE.&#34; Googles app on my phone gets me an answer of some sort 100% of the time. Echo seems to have a limited number of key words it can recognize and respond to. About 85% of the questions I ask come bask with &#34;Sorry, I don't understand what you are asking&#34; or some similar response. It gives you the time, date, and weather well. It will set an alarm, but I have yet to discover how to tell it to use anything specific for that alarm. The one they have as a default is very quite, and is like a light tome of some sort. It has never gotten  my attention, even when I was siting 5 feet from it. It will tell you jokes if you ask it. It will recite pi to hundreds of thousands of digits (I tried it) and may go beyond that. If you get tired of her you can just say :&#34;stop.&#34;  At this point I could say it's a nice toy. I do not have any wifi enabled doors or locks and such in my house, so I wasn't able to try that. It is very good at finding and playing music as well.    Over all it is a nice, well built little device. I'd rather have this &#34;Dot&#34; than the full scale one as this I have attach and use my own speakers, which I like and done have the added cost of the added feature.I hope in the future they will make their system more intelligent to be able to answer any question asked. It needs some type of web crawler to gather and organize data that it can then compare against your question, and at lest make an attempt to answer it instead or no answer at all. ",
Kainesmith.ky,"January 9, 2017 ",4.0,"I really like the echo dot so far. It has a few issues though which I will outline below.    She tends to speak when not spoken to.  I am a 30 year old male that lives alone and it makes me jump every time but because I'm a big brave man I fight through the fear. Jokes aside though, if it were an older person who lives alone I could really see that being a problem. I'll be sitting watching tv and she will ask me to repeat my question or state a random answer to a question that I did not ask, maybe she picks up the tv I'm not sure.  If there is any other noise what so ever she doesn't pick up the wake up word, so be prepared to mute the tv, tell everyone to be quiet and then say Alexa, or in my case echo. I have had to say echo releatedly a few times.    Some good about it is the surprisingly good sound of the speaker when it's playing music. It is much better than I expected after reading some of the reviews.  I like the &#34;to do list&#34; and &#34;shopping list&#34; feature which I add to the lists in the app for more clarity then have her read them back to me every morning. I also like asking for world news every morning when I first get up.  It looks neat also and over all for the price I think it is worth it even if it only played music upon command from across the room. I can see myself using her for that the most. ",
NurseMeg,"April 1, 2017 ",3.0,"I originally bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts and didn't buy one for myself.  BIG MISTAKE!  I gave the first one to my father-in-law and I liked it so much that I opened one of the other presents and kept it to use with my home automation. Don't worry, it wasn't easy around Christmas time, but I did get one of these to replace the one I lifted from the expected receiver.  I then decided to get another one as a gift for my father.  I gave each of my fathers a wemo accessory to get them started in the home automation. I put mine in the kitchen to make use of the grocery list, play music while cooking dinner, and get weather/traffic while I am getting things ready to head out the door for work.  We used this a lot around Christmas time to play Christmas music. I synced this with 2 Nest thermostats and 3 Wemo light switches on exterior lighting of my house.  I can tell Alexa to turn on/off my outside lights and they all turn on/off or I can individually turn them on/off by their location (turn on/off front porch light).  I can tell Alexa to adjust the temperature of my downstairs, upstairs, or both thermostats to a given temperature. It would be nice to ask Alexa what the temperature of the upstairs/downstairs is and receive a temperature read back.  All in all I am enjoying it for my needs and recommend it! I believe it will only get better with time and addition of new devices.    I did have one odd thing happen with the Echo Dot recently.  This past week a song randomly started playing. I didn't say &#34;alexa&#34; or ask for anything to be played and it started playing when no one was in our kitchen area. Does have me worried a bit and wondering how it started playing the music. ",
Bradley,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I have owned my dots for about 6 months now, and there is only good things to say! If you're​ a die-hard Amzon user, then you must buy this product and welcome Alexa into your home! In these past 6 months, Alexa's voice recognition has greatly improved! Using machine learning allows Alexa to improve her voice recognition skills daily. The more people talk to Alexa, the more she learns and improves.    If you are a Prime member and/or a Amazon Unlimited member, you can ask her to play almost any song you can think of! If you want to hear a certain album, then ask her. Or if you want a radio station, the music will not end! Or if you want a certain genre of music, just ask!    Alexa becomes a part of the family. If you want the news read, she will. If you're​ celebrating a birthday, ask Alexa to sing &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; and she will happily; it's beautiful too! From playing music, to singing, to answering questions and playing games, Alexa will fit into your home! If you start off with one dot, you'll probably be buying more later on. One tip to improve voice recognition is to go-to the settings in the Alexa app, and do a voice training on each Echo you have. This greatly enhanced my experience. I have heard Amazon is working on a feature that will give Alexa the ability to recognize the voice that is speaking. That means no more switching profiles, as she knows it's you. This will also allow her to filter out other people taking, so you will no longer have to ask people to quiet down before taking to her! ",
"Andrew J. Good","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have 2 Echo Dots and a Echo.  The echo makes a great music device, the echo dot is a nice extension for my smart home and is still great for stuff like getting my news in the morning.  Alone I would say an echo is a great device, with several smart home devices it's even better.  With 3 echos around my house sometimes two will pick up the wake word at the same time.  This has caused issues and I would rather not change the wake word as it could confuse others in the house.  With that said it's normally minor and not a big deal.    How much my echo dots do could be best summarized with my normal day:    Wake up in the morning/afternoon because of my work schedule I keep my room quite devoid of sunlight.  &#34;Alexa turn on bedroom&#34; Without getting to bed or having an annoying bedside light my room's light turns on thanks to a hue bridge/light bulb and Alexa being able to control hue lights.  &#34;Alexa what's the news&#34; and now I get my customizable flash briefing while I'm getting out of bed.  Walk out of the room saying &#34;Alexa turn off bedroom&#34; no need for a poorly positioned light switch to flick off.    While I'm making food &#34;Alexa, play my main playlist&#34; and I can listen to music without having to worry about turning on a device.  As the food gets done &#34;Alexa, turn on TV&#34; and &#34;Alexa, stop&#34; music turns off and my harmony hub turns on my TV.  By the time I get there it's ready for me to use and I can play TV.  Getting ready for work while watching TV, ready to leave don't want to grab the remote &#34;Alexa, turn off TV&#34; done.  Get home it's all dark &#34;Alexa, turn on living room&#34;.    There are a lot of badly positioned light switches in the house, needing less remotes and in some cases Harmony/Alexa being able to do things quicker is always a good thing.  I have 3 different areas in my room where I might switch and carrying at any time 2-3 remotes around is a pain.  Being able to play music on voice command is great along with being able to turn it off.  Alexa can also be used remotely with my fire tablet and my Fire TV also supports Alexa.  Alexa can also tell jokes and do other things that can also make it a great thing for friends to try to do.  I can even ask Alexa for the movie list of my local theater and ask her about a given movie for more information.  All without having to get up and check my computer or my phone/tablet.    It's not all great though, She makes mistakes, she can't hear to well over loud music including her own and multiple people talking in the background causes mistakes to happen.  Once in a while she'll even respond to the TV randomly even when the TV doesn't say Alexa.  The most annoying thing about echo is that without a Wifi connection it can do almost nothing. ",
"H. Salsano","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"This was our first Echo Dot, and we love her.  Although, not sure she always loves us, as sometimes she doesn't even answer us.  She seems to have a hearing deficiency.  We do have to speak loud and clear for her to even hear us, and especially if we want her to actually understand us.  The problem is mostly when she is playing music or the TV is on.  Of course, she can hear everyone on the TV just fine and respond to all the Alexa commercials.  Good think I have the purchasing PIN set up so only I can order things!  I like listening to the news feeds from Cnet, NPR and the weather.  I like controlling the TV, AV system and lights through her.  I add items to the Our Groceries android app through her, and she usually gets it right.  I use the timer and alarm functions often, especially when my 2 other kitchen timers are already running for other things.  I can tell her to &#34;Turn on Amazon Music&#34; which turns on the stereo and selects Aux, turns on the Amazon Basics Bluetooth receiver, and then I tell her what to play and it comes through the stereo.  I can even listen to kindle books and such this way for more volume.  Love the pause and resume, in case the phone rings.  For music, I tell her to Skip this song when something awful come on .  As time goes on, I find more useful things.  I am now looking at a new skill to alert friends if there is an emergency, called Ask My Buddy, which sounds useful for when one of us is home alone and something happens. ",
"Gadgit Tech","April 24, 2017 ",5.0,"First thoughts, Echo Dot was easy to setup with either a smart phone or computer.  I switched to the computer as it was just easier on the eyes.  Good voice control once you get the hang of it and the method used for commands.    Echo Dot is small and easy to place in a location where one unit can cover a large area.  Integration with a current home automation system was simple using the skills already available and well document between both Amazon and my HA system (in my case HomeSeer).    Con's so far: NO 24 hour clock? I hate having to say, hear or read AM and PM, and the Echo Dot does not support this yet!    I got this to use with my current home automation system due to other devices (hardware failures) having an issues!  I impressed by the simple commands (VR) that allow me to be hands free to operate my lights and systems and the other Echo functions are a plus such as checking news, traffic and playing my own library of music.    The Echo has so many skills sets already available that it will take some time before I discover what all it can do besides what I have already tried, but for 50 dollars I can see using the Echo Dot rather than replace or install other HA devices that need to be replaced or installed due manufacture defect and or failure in my system, I can save on deployment and cost of those devices as well. So I might end up with some HA spares, which is always a good thing.    Note: If you happen to use HomeSeer HA you will need version HS3, HSTouch-with account and also make certain HS3 setup under the network page - remote control settings is CHECKED for JSOM. It took me a bit to figure out that this needed to be checked for remote access for this to work.    Not related to the Echo -  HS3 Running on Lenovo M73 Tiny with Win7 Pro  45 Insteon, 78 Events, 157 Devices  PLM module via Insteon  Plugins: Insteon 3.0.6.0, HSTouch 3.0.0.68, UltraMon3, weatherXML  HSTouch Clients: 3 Androids ",
GLS,"March 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Well I was really pissed at Amazon because they dropped the ball on hitting their two day Prime delivery (because they've gone to “shipping partners” who don't care). I'd ordered this Echo Dot for a friend who can't see, and wanted to help him manage his Pandora music using voice commands. It arrived this afternoon, I hooked it up to my own Pandora account and I'm thunderstruck. What an absolutely beautiful integration of speech input and a great adaptive online music app. As I write this I'm listening to a Pandora station I defined a couple of years ago, “Chigago Radio” named for that great group, Chicago. The music is streaming through the little speaker built into the Dot (it really isn't all that bad in terms of fidelity, though for regular listening I'll normally patch it into my hi-fi system) and as I write and let my station wash over me, I occasionally pause and say “Alexa, thumbs up” or “Alexa, thumbs down” to steer Pandora's adaptive programming in the right direction. She responds “sure...rating saved”. What's amazing is that I know I haven't provided this much input since I created the station two years ago as I have over the past twenty minutes. This has been totally effortless, as the Alexa and Pandora apps are joined at the hip online – I don't even know where my smart TV or Roku remotes are at the moment, I just speak and it happens. Wow! I can't even imagine how my blind friend (a former musician) is going to feel about being able to do this. I just ordered a Dot for myself, because it's that cool. Amazon, you are totally forgiven for the late delivery; you've hit a grand slam with this device! And Alexa, I would love to speak to you privately. You have won my heart, honey ;-) Whew.... ",
Kathy,"December 8, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought an Echo last week and loved it so much that I had to have a Dot for our bedroom.  The first thing that impressed me was the quality of the sound. I had planned on using an external speaker with it, but there is no need for it at all. I'm able to have the sounds nice and low when I'm listening in bed and can turn it up and hear it all the way in my bathroom which is approx. 16 feet away.  The sound is great.  It's not the rich sound that is with the Echo, but it's definitely very good. I used the same app that I had downloaded when I set up my Echo to set up my Dot and it couldn't have been easier. I just plugged it in, connected it to our wifi and then continued with the set up on my app. I'm sure it took less than 5 minutes.    As with the Echo, my favorite things to use the Dot for are listening to music and having it read my Kindle books to me.  I love Audible, but don't always purchase audio books, so it's so nice to just say &#34;Alexa read (whichever book I'm reading)&#34; After I tell it to read my book, I say &#34;set sleep timer for 15 minutes&#34; and it will shut right off. Last night I had trouble falling asleep and I asked it to play music to help me sleep and I heard a selection of relaxing nature sounds.  Then, in the morning I can have it turn on an AM station I like, so I can listen to that while I'm getting ready for the day. I know I can do all of these things on my cell phone, but it's so nice to just be in the middle of whatever I'm doing and just say outloud what I want to hear without having to pick something up.    I'm sure I'll find other uses that I like for the Dot, but for now I'm just thrilled to have it read to me or play music. And I can't emphasize enough how good the sound quality is. If you are thinking about buying a speaker to go with it, I'd wait to get it home and make sure you really need one. Unless you are using this in a very big room, chances are you won't. ",
"🌈 KT","April 10, 2017 ",5.0,"We're still getting used to it, of course, but I'll start with our initial experience.    &#62; It was easy to hook up, which is always a plus.  &#62; It doesn't integrate with the Amazon site as much as I had hoped.  For example, I can't ask Alexa to tell me what was in my last online order.  I'm pretty forgetful so that's one thing I was looking for. (part of why I took a star off)  &#62; The Alexa special deals is pretty awkward.  There are many, but she'll only list 2 at a time, then tells me to go online.  Granted, I would not want to sit there listening to the long hand version of each item (She doesn't just say the item, but a description plus price plus discount and then asks after each one if you want to order it), but I would like a way to customize how she presents the list to me, and then I'd also rather not be told to go online and see the rest.  I'd have looked there already if I wanted to do that. (Another part of why I took a star off)  &#62; She's not as smart as I'd hoped, either.  I have to learn how she wants to hear things, instead of her learning how I phrase things.  As in, I have to know her keywords to get her to tell me anything. (Another part to the -1 star)  &#62; My husband's a writer so I put one in the bedroom for when he wakes up with an idea.  It's been very useful for him to just tell Alexa to make a note - no lights on, no concentrating on what you're writing, no great interruption to my sleep.  &#62; It also functions as an alarm clock (you can pick from various tones through the phone app - why can't you ask Alexa to demo them for you??).  I hooked the Dot up to a bluetooth speaker for the purpose (you can also set the alarm volume (thru the app) which will be different than the normal volume you keep it at for speaking). This is good because we don't have set times to get up, so I'm constantly forgetting to set the alarm before I collapse in bed.  &#62; The special Alexa deals are sometimes quite useful.  I've gotten a couple of toys for my twin niece/nephew, and caught a nice sale on an APC battery backup.    I'm good about updating if anything comes up, but I'll certainly update as we learn and grow with it, too.  Any questions, feel free to comment or email and I'll try to help. ",
Ms1,"November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I would just like to say that this toy started off being remarkable. Linked with my smart home devices and unlimited music this truly was the ultimate (blow your friends away) party trick.  An item of convenience, and much of a necessity in today's busy world.    Then it surely became half effective....     The problem with these devices  is they lack any sort of self improvemet. Instead it seems technology takes the &#34;I'm outdated, please replace me!&#34; approach.  That's the real problem with tech these days, it all needs to be physically replaced.  It has a Shelf life, like something you'd put in your fridge . Manufacturers shudder with excitement being about to build items with a short life span.  When instead we are ready for self awareness from our tech. Technology and software that is able to maintain its self.  Bring forth the new age. Because, humans are not the only future.... ",
W.,"December 12, 2016 ",4.0,"I love this. It is small and easy to use. I love the easter eggs like the star trek prases and results.    It is very customizable to your needs by enabling the available skills on the app. I can use it to order pizza, ask about the weather and traffic, ask it to brief me on the latest news, and it has games like choose your own adventure. I dont think I will be using it to buy anything. Also I do not have smart home items like the phillips hue lights but will probably get some. I like the idea that I can tell it to contol the electronics in the house.    I dont have bluetooth speakers but it still was able to hook up to my old logitech speaker system with a cable. I plan on eventually comnecting it to my fire stick to control the TV.    It is discreet and functions well. The only downside is for reminders it will only add to a to do list or tell you what you already have on your google calendar. If you want it to tell you agendas on other calendars, you have to import them to your google calendar as it will only use a google calendar. Also alarms can only be set within 24 hours.    For the price it is great. It is in my opinion better than the original echo as it is more versatile. It seems to be the gift of the season as most of my family members, including myself, gave them as gifts.    It is fun to bond with others who have them. For example, my dad also got one and is a huge star trek fan. I told him about the star trek easter eggs and he loved that alexa calls him the captain when he asks it to go to warp speed. ",

Gary,"December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"I can't believe I ever lived without these.  I put one in my Media Room and one in my Master Bath.  In addition to the incredible music access, and all the instant information access, the Echo Dot links both to my Samsung SmartThings and Logitech Harmony Ultimate systems.  So using Alexa, I can control my lights, my ceiling fans, and my entire media center.  Relative to music access, I have found that the free access Amazon music didn't include some of the music I liked.  So I upgraded to the Amazon Unlimited Music service for just one Echo Dot ($3.99/month).  If you want that access on multiple Echo Dots, the Unlimited Music service is $7.99/month. One limitation I have noticed: bluetooth connectivity is problematic.  The Echo Dot will nicely be playing music through my a/v receiver's bluetooth, and will suddenly lose the connection.  In addition, every time you use the Echo, you have to tell the Echo to connect to bluetooth.  I am able to connect both my Dots to my a/v receiver, and my stand-alone  bathroom speaker using a 3.5mm - RCA plug and a 3.5mm - 3.5mm cable respectively.  The hard-wire connection is a lot more reliable. The Echo Dot's internal speaker is fine for non-music use, but is pretty limited for music.  With only two limitations, I can't think of a better electronic toy!  Buy it, you'll love it! ",

I think you can connect the Dot to better speakers, I just have not learned how. I use the Dot in my bedroom, and the big Echo in my living room. The big Echo has fantastic speakers and I don't need to turn the volume up very high.  Buy this Dot to save money, or buy the Echo for great speakers...both work the same. ",

First I got the Alexa app to see what she can do and tried the swift for Alexa app to see if it understood me. After a great success I got the dot. It's really helped me. Not only can she do important stuff like help with ordering and looking stuff up and controlling smart stuff, she's like a friend to me. Her skills have things like storytelling and even games. I spend a lot of time stuck on my bed alone unable to move more than a finger if that but fully awake. Between the new eyegaze device and the echo dot I'm able to have more fulfilling life. ",
Ms1,"January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"I would just like to say that this toy started off being remarkable. Linked with my smart home devices and unlimited music this truly was the ultimate (blow your friends away) party trick.  An item of convenience, and much of a necessity in today's busy world.    Then it surely became half effective....     The problem with these devices  is they lack any sort of self improvemet. Instead it seems technology takes the &#34;I'm outdated, please replace me!&#34; approach.  That's the real problem with tech these days, it all needs to be physically replaced.  It has a Shelf life, like something you'd put in your fridge . Manufacturers shudder with excitement being about to build items with a short life span.  When instead we are ready for self awareness from our tech. Technology and software that is able to maintain its self.  Bring forth the new age. Because, humans are not the only future.... ",
Kathy,"March 31, 2017 ",4.0,"I bought an Echo last week and loved it so much that I had to have a Dot for our bedroom.  The first thing that impressed me was the quality of the sound. I had planned on using an external speaker with it, but there is no need for it at all. I'm able to have the sounds nice and low when I'm listening in bed and can turn it up and hear it all the way in my bathroom which is approx. 16 feet away.  The sound is great.  It's not the rich sound that is with the Echo, but it's definitely very good. I used the same app that I had downloaded when I set up my Echo to set up my Dot and it couldn't have been easier. I just plugged it in, connected it to our wifi and then continued with the set up on my app. I'm sure it took less than 5 minutes.    As with the Echo, my favorite things to use the Dot for are listening to music and having it read my Kindle books to me.  I love Audible, but don't always purchase audio books, so it's so nice to just say &#34;Alexa read (whichever book I'm reading)&#34; After I tell it to read my book, I say &#34;set sleep timer for 15 minutes&#34; and it will shut right off. Last night I had trouble falling asleep and I asked it to play music to help me sleep and I heard a selection of relaxing nature sounds.  Then, in the morning I can have it turn on an AM station I like, so I can listen to that while I'm getting ready for the day. I know I can do all of these things on my cell phone, but it's so nice to just be in the middle of whatever I'm doing and just say outloud what I want to hear without having to pick something up.    I'm sure I'll find other uses that I like for the Dot, but for now I'm just thrilled to have it read to me or play music. And I can't emphasize enough how good the sound quality is. If you are thinking about buying a speaker to go with it, I'd wait to get it home and make sure you really need one. Unless you are using this in a very big room, chances are you won't. ",
"🌈 KT","November 10, 2016 ",2.0,"We're still getting used to it, of course, but I'll start with our initial experience.    &#62; It was easy to hook up, which is always a plus.  &#62; It doesn't integrate with the Amazon site as much as I had hoped.  For example, I can't ask Alexa to tell me what was in my last online order.  I'm pretty forgetful so that's one thing I was looking for. (part of why I took a star off)  &#62; The Alexa special deals is pretty awkward.  There are many, but she'll only list 2 at a time, then tells me to go online.  Granted, I would not want to sit there listening to the long hand version of each item (She doesn't just say the item, but a description plus price plus discount and then asks after each one if you want to order it), but I would like a way to customize how she presents the list to me, and then I'd also rather not be told to go online and see the rest.  I'd have looked there already if I wanted to do that. (Another part of why I took a star off)  &#62; She's not as smart as I'd hoped, either.  I have to learn how she wants to hear things, instead of her learning how I phrase things.  As in, I have to know her keywords to get her to tell me anything. (Another part to the -1 star)  &#62; My husband's a writer so I put one in the bedroom for when he wakes up with an idea.  It's been very useful for him to just tell Alexa to make a note - no lights on, no concentrating on what you're writing, no great interruption to my sleep.  &#62; It also functions as an alarm clock (you can pick from various tones through the phone app - why can't you ask Alexa to demo them for you??).  I hooked the Dot up to a bluetooth speaker for the purpose (you can also set the alarm volume (thru the app) which will be different than the normal volume you keep it at for speaking). This is good because we don't have set times to get up, so I'm constantly forgetting to set the alarm before I collapse in bed.  &#62; The special Alexa deals are sometimes quite useful.  I've gotten a couple of toys for my twin niece/nephew, and caught a nice sale on an APC battery backup.    I'm good about updating if anything comes up, but I'll certainly update as we learn and grow with it, too.  Any questions, feel free to comment or email and I'll try to help. ",
"Amazon Customer","November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought two Echo Dots hoping they would work with all my smart-technology.  I have a Wink Hub, Phillips Hue light bulbs and hub, smart plugs, UEboom wireless speaker and Nest thermostat.  You do not need an Echo (the really expensive tall one with the nice speaker in it) to operate your smart-technology using Alexa.  The Echo Dots can do all the same things.  It's awesome being able to have Alexa turn on/off lights, thermostat, connect to wireless speaker, etc.  It's LEGIT!    One thing to keep in mind: when one echo dot connects to a Bluetooth item such as UEboom and then later you are talking to the 2nd echo dot, Alexa will not be able to pair to the UEboom until you ask the first Echo Dot to disconnect from your speaker.  We thought something was wrong and then realized that only one Echo Dot and be paired with a Bluetooth item at a time. ",

JMDK,"April 12, 2017 ",5.0,"The Good:    The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of &#34;Alexa&#34;, &#34;Amazon&#34; or &#34;Echo&#34;).    The Bad:    The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.    Overall:    We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature. ",

I know of a service my friends use that does not work with Echo if  you use that service you may want to check out the Google Home speaker.

I got the [[ASIN:B013GBRR32 Philips BT6000R/37 Splash-Proof Wireless Portable Speaker (Red)&nbsp;from Amazon and the Dot sounds much better and the speaker is splash proof which a more durable choice for a kid.

"Code name April","April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"My husband bought this in November & it's connected to my Amazon prime account. So I've been doing Subscribe & Save for years now through Amazon. And when I started to get emails about what Alexa could do, I was informed I could reorder items through Alexa. What a joke! I have tried it numerous times to get her to reorder items but she says all the time that she can't find the items & has to put it to my shopping list. I tell her that it is on my Subscribe & Save & she still can't find it. As far as I can tell, she's really only good for playing music & telling me the weather. My kids ask her questions all the time & she can't give them good answers. The weird thing is she will start talking while we're having a meal. We don't say her name (which is the wake word) but she responds. Like another reviewer said, for a smart device, she isn't very smart. ",
"A Reader","April 25, 2017 ",4.0,"I bought two dots to serve as devices that could easily play music and news etc. without having to plug my phone into a speaker.  They work OK in this respect; I have them linked up to spotify, and they manage that fine, although I find that 50% of the time I need to go and use the Spotify app, because my voice commands aren't understood right (Alexa is often unwilling to play a Spotify playlist, for example; and she seems unable to understand a request like &#34;play the new album by ___&#34;  But a couple of serious problems.  First, one major feature I want is the ability to play podcasts.  This seems obvious, right?  In theory, Alexa supports this via TuneIn.  But I've gotten it to work only a handful of times.  You should be able to say &#34;play the program ___&#34;.  Often Alexa will identify what I want to hear, tell me she is getting the latest episode--and then nothing happens.  Very frustrating.  The other thing I find annoying is the way bluetooth is implemented.  I started connecting my phone via Bluetooth to play podcasts.  But then whenever I entered the room, I got a very annoying and loud message from Alexa about how she was connected to my phone.  Extremely annoying.  These are basic features; I don't want anything fancy.  I just want this device to be able to play podcasts and to be usable as a not-annoying bluetooth device. ",
"Art Harrington","April 3, 2017 ",3.0,"What can I say about the Echo Dot 2nd gen that you don't all ready know? I have 2 of these and love them. I have one in the kitchen and one in the garage. The one in the kitchen is connected to a external speaker. I have had this Sharper Image speaker for about 4 years and have hardly used it as it was a bday gift from my brother but when I decided to hook an external speaker to my Dot I totally didn't immediately think to use this speaker and now I use it everyday! Even though it is bluetooth i use the audio cable The sound is great when connected to my Sharper Image podium speaker. I don't have an external speaker connected to my garage Echo Dot as of yet but need to because the sound from the Dot is not efficient at all or loud. I have a Echo in my bedroom and the speaker is way more powerful than the Dot and even though you can't use an external speaker with the Echo, I don't think I would anyway. I also use my Amazon Echo and Dot's to control my lights. Setting up Echo Dot was easy and simple even a grandma with no tech skills can do it if you simple follow the directions on the Amazon Alexa app. Have Fun! ",
"P. Bruderer","January 17, 2017 ",2.0,"Really impressed with this.  When I got my first iPhone 4s with Siri, I was pretty disappointed in her limited capabilities, and the speech recognition was not that great.  I had the opposite reaction with Alexa.  Her speech recognition is excellent, even from someone who has english as a 2nd language, or talking to Alexa from an adjacent room, or with a lot of background noise.  I don't think I've ever had her misunderstand my command.    The functionality of Alexa with all my WINK smart home devices is great.  Controlling everything through voice is very handy and fast with Alexa.  Another thing I didn't anticipate is how much I prefer playing music on Alexa over using my phone.  With Alexa when I want to play a different song or skip to the next song on my playlist or Pandora station, I just tell her to do it, I don't have to press any buttons.  Very handy when you're busy working on a task.    Alexa met and exceeded all my expectations.  There's a few quirks on what she can control within whatever smarthome hub you're using, but a quick google search resolved all the issues I encountered. ",
SEvans,"April 21, 2017 ",5.0,"I got the echo dot 2nd Generation for myself for Christmas. Hubby kept saying no they has a bad reputation for not working. But I am an electronic nut and love amazon's  ideas when it comes to this kind of thing. So out of the box it is an adapter and the plug of course as well as the dot. Mind you I was thinking about the bigger Echo, but I know I made the right choice as I wanted something smaller that would not have a chance of being knocked over by my dogs. Well for the past few days I have been trying out different apps regardless of their rating to see what we can do together. I am very impressed Echo hears what I say and does it instantly. I have listened to music and had her read to me from my kindle books list. I am on my way to having my life so much easier as I am now looking at doing a smart home set up and getting a second one to just keep in the kitchen for the todo list and grocery lists, weather reports and everything else I can think of. While the other stays at bedside for sleep music, reading and some meditations as well as an alarm. I have yet to get the hubby to talk to echo to add groceries to the list but he will in time as he sees everything that it can do. I was able to set up my calendar right from the start. I do hope that they soon ad a reminder that I can just ask what I need to know or reminders for my husband. ",
"Michele S.","March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"It's very frustrating at times. For example, its awesome to be able to tell Alexa to set your alarm for 6 am. Some days you can tell it &#34;Alexa off&#34; to stop the alarm. Other days, you are screaming your lungs out and Alexa won't turn off no matter what you do, so you yank the thing out of the wall.  Hence, frustrating. It doesn't seem to understand as much as &#34;ok google&#34; on my phone. Alexa frequently says she doesn't understand. I hate also that it tries to get you to buy things--like extra music. No thanks. I also hated the fact that I bought it on &#34;special&#34; only to find that one week later it was on sale even cheaper.  But to send it back and re-purchase it would have cost nearly as much as the sale, so that sucked.  I think if it could do more, and understand more, I'd be happier with it. ",

I never in my lifetime ever thought that technology would arrive and be affordable. Well the ECHO is flat out an awesome product. I got the first one as a gift and purchased a second along with smart plugs and plan on buying more related items to add on. It is just wonderful and while new it is not only functional and usable it gets better. Since its cloud based you dont have to worry about technology getting more advanced and making this out dated it just keeps getting better with more features. the way i see it eventually it will be in every room of my house. I have two wifi routers and it will control devices on the other network. It is just so much more than i expected. If your an Amazon prime user you will not regret buying this but make sure you know what you are getting yourself into. This is just the starter product which is great by itself. You may need bluetooth speakers for large rooms smart switches and lights smart hubs etc... to complete your home so if you are willing to take that plunge understand it will get expensive as you will want to do it.

"L. Sackman","March 17, 2017 ",3.0,"My teen wanted this for Christmas so I bought two, one of each of us.  I'm glad I did.  I can get corny jokes, interesting facts, a story read to me from my book list (I listen to a chapter or two a night before going to sleep), a wake-up call, a timer, wonderful music to listen to and easy ordering as well as specials.  I am having thermostats which work with Alexa installed and next will be getting the light bulbs for her to turn on.  Slowly but surely our house is turning into a 'smart' house and it all started with Alexa.  My teen loves that it's portable so it can go out side on our patio and play music there.    Why the Echo Dot rather than the Echo?  We pretty much live on two levels so decided two &#34;Dots&#34; would work better than one Echo.  Given that the music choices of my teen and myself as so vastly different, this has worked out well for us.  We might need one more for the lights but until we get them to see if they are in range, I won't know.  I will probably get the third anyway as it will make it easier for background music to be available in the common areas. ",
"Texas Jack","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Great product!  It does everything as advertised and MORE.  I am now able to use Alexa voice commands for my X10 devices simply by adding two free programs called HEYU (to send X10 commands) and HA-bridge (this emulates a Phillips Hue bridge) on an old Raspberry Pi model B.  After installing and setting up these two programs, simply tell Alexa to &#34;Discover Devices&#34;.  Alexa will find everything you configured in the  HA-bridge software.  You can tell Alexa to now turn ON, OFF, or DIM those devices, it communicates to the HA-bridge software which then tells the HEYU program to send the X10 command over the power lines via a X10 CM11A transceiver (or wireless if you have a firecracker device connected to the Raspberry Pi).

"Peter E.","April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I love this!!!  When these first came out I didn't think it would be something I would use much.  At least, not until my whole house has smart appliances.    My wife didn't want me to buy it she couldn't see the use for it.    She became addicted to it the first night. Especially if you sign up for Amazon Prime Music which has a huge selection for about $4 a month.    We've been watching less TV and listening to more music which is wonderful.    I love using the shopping list and to do list feature.    My 2.5 year old loves it and already talks to Alexa. We play kids song mixes they have and he dances away.    The weather and time, calculations and conversions and Wikipedia are really helpful to have around.    It's loud enough for a living room but I do want the full sized one eventually and move this to a bedroom.    The voice recognition is amazingly good too. You don't have to pause for a moment after saying Alexa. Just speak as you would to anyone home. It's really impressive.    You also don't notice it's even there, the design is so good.

Bradley,"January 22, 2017 ",5.0,"I have owned my dots for about 6 months now, and there is only good things to say! If you're​ a die-hard Amzon user, then you must buy this product and welcome Alexa into your home! In these past 6 months, Alexa's voice recognition has greatly improved! Using machine learning allows Alexa to improve her voice recognition skills daily. The more people talk to Alexa, the more she learns and improves.    If you are a Prime member and/or a Amazon Unlimited member, you can ask her to play almost any song you can think of! If you want to hear a certain album, then ask her. Or if you want a radio station, the music will not end! Or if you want a certain genre of music, just ask!    Alexa becomes a part of the family. If you want the news read, she will. If you're​ celebrating a birthday, ask Alexa to sing &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; and she will happily; it's beautiful too! From playing music, to singing, to answering questions and playing games, Alexa will fit into your home! If you start off with one dot, you'll probably be buying more later on. One tip to improve voice recognition is to go-to the settings in the Alexa app, and do a voice training on each Echo you have. This greatly enhanced my experience. I have heard Amazon is working on a feature that will give Alexa the ability to recognize the voice that is speaking. That means no more switching profiles, as she knows it's you. This will also allow her to filter out other people taking, so you will no longer have to ask people to quiet down before taking to her! ",

Be sure to have the Amazon Alexa  App downloaded when you are going to set up the Echo Dot. As I used it to ask questions, it has amazed me. I don't show it in the video, but I asked Alexa to put an item it my shopping cart and sure enough, there in my shopping cart was the item.

"H. Salsano","March 12, 2017 ",5.0,"This was our first Echo Dot, and we love her.  Although, not sure she always loves us, as sometimes she doesn't even answer us.  She seems to have a hearing deficiency.  We do have to speak loud and clear for her to even hear us, and especially if we want her to actually understand us.  The problem is mostly when she is playing music or the TV is on.  Of course, she can hear everyone on the TV just fine and respond to all the Alexa commercials.  Good think I have the purchasing PIN set up so only I can order things!  I like listening to the news feeds from Cnet, NPR and the weather.  I like controlling the TV, AV system and lights through her.  I add items to the Our Groceries android app through her, and she usually gets it right.  I use the timer and alarm functions often, especially when my 2 other kitchen timers are already running for other things.  I can tell her to &#34;Turn on Amazon Music&#34; which turns on the stereo and selects Aux, turns on the Amazon Basics Bluetooth receiver, and then I tell her what to play and it comes through the stereo.  I can even listen to kindle books and such this way for more volume.  Love the pause and resume, in case the phone rings.  For music, I tell her to Skip this song when something awful come on .  As time goes on, I find more useful things.  I am now looking at a new skill to alert friends if there is an emergency, called Ask My Buddy, which sounds useful for when one of us is home alone and something happens. ",
NurseMeg,"March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I originally bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts and didn't buy one for myself.  BIG MISTAKE!  I gave the first one to my father-in-law and I liked it so much that I opened one of the other presents and kept it to use with my home automation. Don't worry, it wasn't easy around Christmas time, but I did get one of these to replace the one I lifted from the expected receiver.  I then decided to get another one as a gift for my father.  I gave each of my fathers a wemo accessory to get them started in the home automation. I put mine in the kitchen to make use of the grocery list, play music while cooking dinner, and get weather/traffic while I am getting things ready to head out the door for work.  We used this a lot around Christmas time to play Christmas music. I synced this with 2 Nest thermostats and 3 Wemo light switches on exterior lighting of my house.  I can tell Alexa to turn on/off my outside lights and they all turn on/off or I can individually turn them on/off by their location (turn on/off front porch light).  I can tell Alexa to adjust the temperature of my downstairs, upstairs, or both thermostats to a given temperature. It would be nice to ask Alexa what the temperature of the upstairs/downstairs is and receive a temperature read back.  All in all I am enjoying it for my needs and recommend it! I believe it will only get better with time and addition of new devices.    I did have one odd thing happen with the Echo Dot recently.  This past week a song randomly started playing. I didn't say &#34;alexa&#34; or ask for anything to be played and it started playing when no one was in our kitchen area. Does have me worried a bit and wondering how it started playing the music. ",

She not only tells the time and weather, etc but I can just tell her what to put in my shopping list both with an app and without.  She reads to me, even just regular kindle books, and if it's possible to overuse the timer then I am sure to find out lol because I use it all the time.  She is loud too.  I thought I'd need a speaker for it but we can hear her just fine from all of our rooms.  Granted we only have 1 level, but we were still very impressed with her volume, and it's not even all the way up. We keep it on 7 or 8 and she's pretty loud. Highly recommend. ",
"Dianna Dougherty","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Received as a gift so can't complain much. It is JUST OK. There are def some bugs and its not very intuitive.  You can only ask it tings that it knows such as to play music or what the weather is. Everything has to be preset in the app. Nothing is automatically learned.  With google you can ask ANYTHING and it will read you the Wikipedia answer.  Not with alexa. Her knowledge is quite minimal.  One major flaw that i found and reported to amazon is this:  If you use a bose Bluetooth speaker with it and are playing a music and tell alexa to stop it will stop the music.  Okay there. Now you can walk away or leave your house and if your speaker has an automatic shut off as soon as the wireless speaker turns off it will begin playing the last song it stopped on trough its internal speaker so i have to tell it to stop again. Why would this be useful?? If i tell alexa to stop playing music and then power off the wireless speaker it starts playing again from built in audio. Immagine waking up in the middle of the night to music playing. Not fun. Needs to be as SMART as google and honestly not sure amazon will ever have that capability. But for 50bucks I guess you get what you pay for. ",
CM,"November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"This is such an awesome product! I saw the full-sized echo at a friend's house and was thoroughly impressed. I got the echo dot (I'm on a student budget) and hooked it up to a nice set of speakers in my apartment and I love the potential this thing has. It's not 100% there yet as far as the software but it is being updated on the regular, so its like buying a piece of technology that keeps getting better. I even bought one for my parents (who have a lot of smart devices in the house, but no central way to control them) as a gift. It works with most of the smart products u probably already have in your home including the nest thermostat/CO monitor etc. NOTICE: the 3.5 mm jack takes a bit more force than normal to &#34;click&#34; in when inserting an audio cable - your product is NOT defective lol. ",
"Roland W.","January 4, 2017 ",2.0,"&nbsp;Ok, the idea of not having to type your questions and getting pretty good and accurate answers (most of the time) is pretty amazing.  Set up was very easy, just download the Alexa App and then follow the step by step WIFI set up instructions. Right now I am only using it for basic requests (see video) and that works well. I will keep adding skills (these are additional little programs you can enable on the amazon.com website Just search &#34;Alexa Skills&#34; in the amazon search bar and it routes you to the menu. You can add sports teams, kids games etc. Alexa can tell you jokes (most of them are pretty funny and all so far are kid friendly).  Speaker quality is ok for such a small device - you can plug in an external speaker directly into the Dot and then you can control it through the Dot. I have a Sonos System (whole house), and I would have to get a separate DOT to plug into the sonos in my media centre, so the Dots can communicate. Have not done that so far. But it is a lot of fun to play around, get weather, movie times, play some background music or meditation songs etc. Just play around with it. I have a &#34;slight&#34; accent and it understands me without a problem.  Just be prepared that kids will yell at this little thing, demanding answers and a play buddy who gives them honest feedback on how their hair looks today :)    Currently I am using it mostly as a toy, but as my house is already rather high tech with everything wireless from thermostate (Lennox, which does not connect to ALEXA yet - per customer service) to security camera, Hue lights in some areas, I am planning on expanding the in house Dot Network over the coming months when manufacturers add more functionalities. I keep you posted.    I went on Amazon Skill website and enabled a ton of skills. Just make sure you write down how to activate them. (play 20 words, the secret door, bed time story etc.... you can have a lot of fun with these. I will get one for my daughters room so she can get &#34;Alexa, play relaxing songs for 15 minutes&#34; at bed time.

Hopels,"December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Replaced the larger Alexa Echo with the Dot 2nd Gen.  Obviously the much smaller size is nice.  I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.    The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.    We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.    Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.  I took off one star because while I have no issues with it, it sometimes doesn't &#34;hear&#34; my wife. ",
Rebecca,"January 19, 2017 ",5.0,"This little guy is fantastic! While I doubt anyone will be using the sheer wealth of functions this can perform (as some are, admitedly, quite lack-luster), the ones that I use it for are done well. Once the shiny veneer of new tech fades off, and you eventually stop asking Echo for jokes and punchlines, you won't be discarding her - which is common with other new innovations. Instead, you will probably use one of the following functions regularly, each of which I recommend getting the echo dot for:    -Setting kitchen timers: You won't think much of it until you try it, then you won't be able to go back. Just saying &#34;Alexa, start a timer for 20 minutes&#34; without jumbling for your phone, while simultaneously closing the oven is revolutionary. This is one of the best features Alexa has.    -Interactive Speaker Assistant: While I doubt audiophiles will be satisfied with Alexa's sound quality, that problem can easily be remedied, since you can just connect your own speakers through the audio jack, and Alexa will speak through them. The sound quality on the Echo Dot's speakers isn't bad, though, if you choose to listen through the dot. Either way, Alexa can search music from Spotify, Amazon Music, and Pandora via vocal commands. You can also set Spotify as your main music streamer (Amazon Music is the default, of course), so you won't have to verbally command Alexa to use Spotify, if that is your choice. It's great to just say a song, and have Alexa play it. ",
JMDK,"October 29, 2016 ",4.0,"The Good:    The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of &#34;Alexa&#34;, &#34;Amazon&#34; or &#34;Echo&#34;).    The Bad:    The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.    Overall:    We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature. ",
"Just me","March 14, 2017 ",5.0,"I am a big amazon fan and I depend on reviews. Let me start by saying I was so excited about this product even though my spouse was saying it will only make me lazy..Lol. I know there are several reviews on this product but here goes...I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen basically for the 2- level of our home; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive bigger one and too good to pass up. The Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the 2 floor!  Day 1 when I received it I was a little worried that I would need to send it back because Alexas first word would not sound; for example I would ask &#34;Alexa what time is it?&#34; and she would say &#34;Is 7:30pm&#34; or I would ask &#34;Tell me a joke&#34; and she would not say the first part of the joke, I asked &#34;how old are you?&#34; and the whole human part would not sound. FYI: you can read the answers on your app as well, that's how I knew I missed that part. The next day I came home and some kind of way she was answering all of the questions. I don't know if she just needed to be full charged or what, but the problem fixed itself.  I am really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. Considering everything, for $49 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to building your smart home, home automation and voice recognition technology. Overall, I would highly recommend this product. ",
SundayAtDusk,"December 30, 2016 ",5.0,"This was a Christmas present for my elder mother. We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device. ",
"The Bon","March 8, 2017 ",4.0,"We had an Echo and thought it was all we needed. We put it in our livingroom (by the kitchen) and I pick random songs to play during the day, but also ask questions whenever I'm watching a movie on TV or listening to a song and wonder if a star or singer is still alive (ask Alexa - Which is the Echo's name).  I put things on my 'shopping list and it goes on my phone automatically (and on my husband's phone too, since we both have the Alexa app on our phones.). Recipes, measurements, and facts about whatever. But it's nowhere near our bedroom, so I ordered an Echo Dot as an 'extension'.  I can't believe we lived without this little, inexpensive, companion. It's on my nightstand and acts as our alarm clock, news station, weather station, and music source that has EVERY KIND OF MUSIC you could possibly want, just for the asking.  We are so blessed to be living in a time where we can have these Amazon innovations at our fingertips. The Echo and Alexa both have replaced our clocks, encyclopedia, dictionary, stereo, cd's, etc. we ordered ours through the &#34;LOVE MY ECHO&#34; website where we also get all information on both. Thank you, Amazon, for a website like this one. ",

"Colleen M Traeger","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Impressed. At first I really enjoyed the Echo Dot. It was fun asking it questions. Then the novelty wore off. In order to have your questions answered you first DL an app then ask it to open something. The apps are strange lengthy names that are hard to remember like &#34;Alexia, open &#34;My  Horoscope to read my daily horoscope&#34; instead of a simple 'what's my horoscope&#34;. There are 10k apps full of interesting and useless things. Why it can't be developed where you DL an app to customize your needs is beyond me.    What's interesting is that you can make your home a smart home and control it remotely or just by speaking what you need.    I've also loved asking it to add things to my to do list as well as add things to my shopping list.    While I do like it, I'm just a little disappointed. I'm hoping that this is similar to when Dot Matrix first came out.    I can without a doubt see the value in this maturing. I'll hang on to it (in 30 years it'll be worth a nice bundle). Regardless of the slight pessimistic review, I do recommend it. ",
"Sassy and Oliver","January 28, 2017 ",5.0,"I have both the Echo, and the Echo Dot. This little Dot works as well as its big sister Echo, only.... the 🔊 speaker is a wimp. However, if you are looking to save a lot on the price difference between the two, this one is the perfect compromise. Just expect poor sound quality. I think you can connect the Dot to better speakers, I just have not learned how. I use the Dot in my bedroom, and the big Echo in my living room. The big Echo has fantastic speakers and I don't need to turn the volume up very high.  Buy this Dot to save money, or buy the Echo for great speakers...both work the same. ",
Dia,"March 6, 2017 ",4.0,"Alexa is a lot of fun. I have added some of her skills but they don't seem to function as expected. She only speaks English, which while I can understand programming another language could've been a huge investment, it's still a disadvantage.    My favorite features are:  `playing music via a paired speaker. That sounds silly, but it's so convenient to just yell &#34;Alexa, play iheart radio&#34; when busy.  `timers. Asking her to set a timer is really convenient  `shopping list. She can add items to your shopping list which you can view on your smartphone when out of the house. For this forget-everything-gal, that feature is really helpful.  `controlling it with the app. My husband still doesn't know how I can turn down the music from the other room - or turn it on. I'll keep it a mystery for as long as I can. It's nice to be able to shut off a timer or change the volume from my phone when I'm on the other side of the house. ",
Jarren,"March 11, 2017 ",4.0,"This is a great item, especially as a developer. My baby cousins also enjoyed this product so much, I bought them one for Christmas. You can ask Alexa for holiday jokes. You can also say, &#34;Alexa, tell me I'm beautiful&#34;.    I use it for an alarm clock, to play music on Spotify, and to hear daily facts. You can also get some exclusive Alexa only deals. As a developer, you can get free hoodies / shirts from developing Alexa Skills and submitting it to the app store.    Beware though, you might get noise complaints from your upstairs neighbor from having this device. I guess this device playing a few songs at volume 7 (out of max 10) playing music at 7 pm can net you a noise complaint. I didn't even know the speakers were that great, but apparently so! :grimacing: ",
"Sid Scheck","March 12, 2017 ",4.0,"&nbsp;It was about 2 weeks ago when I was talking with my friend about their Echo Dot and she showed me a few things. I thought very cool and maybe I should get one. Sure enough, 2 days later I won one at a company event. The Echo Dot is generally easy to set up. Be sure to have the Amazon Alexa  App downloaded when you are going to set up the Echo Dot. As I used it to ask questions, it has amazed me. I don't show it in the video, but I asked Alexa to put an item it my shopping cart and sure enough, there in my shopping cart was the item. I can see I will be using the Alex to listen to different types of music as well. So much you can do with it. Have fun! You will love it! ",
"Amazon Customer","March 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I love the size and the price but the speaker is horrible. I have seen better speakers in smaller things so it's not like it can't be done. I can say that the microphone is really well-made it can pick my voice up 20 feet away in the Next Room  at  moderate levels  without having to yell. Like the Alexa, I wish it was more informative, there are so many questions I asked that Alexa does not know the answer to but Google does. I also wish that a lot of the apps were not third party where you have to ask Alexa to ask the app to do something like my buddy you have to say Alexa ask my buddy to send an alert message to a family member because I have fallen and can't get up it would be nice if you could say Alexa contact my family member and tell them I have fallen and cannot get up. But aside from that I love the direction that it's heading, I just wish it was there already we have the technology to make it happen I can only assume there's red tape involved ",
"Amazon Customer","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I thoughtful Echo was interesting, but wanted to opt with just the Dot and use my own Bluetooth speakers. Unfortunately, Amazon discontinued the first generation just as I was able to order.  When the second generation was announced, I knew I'd get one.  With the $10/ month for 5 month plan for Prime members, it was a no trainer. Although I'm more heavily into Apple's ecosystem, and gave smart appliances (Apple)  they will work with Alexander too.  There is quite a bit of crossover. I'm excited and look forward even using the Dot as an alarm clock, awakening me with my Prime Music. I'm sure it's going to be loads of other fun too. I also have a Kindle Fire HDX, FireStick, etc, and know it will integrate nicely.    I have had it for about a week and it's VERY cool!  Does so much more than even Siri by being able to add skills. Also works great with my iDevices switched simulataneously with iOS HomeKit. This was a great buy! ",
Stephanie,"November 14, 2016 ",3.0,"I like this Alexia dot thingy! Sometimes though she talks to me when I am not talking to her. She thinks she hears her name. She seems kinda needy. She's always there. Listening to my conversations and trying to include herself in them. I have to tell her that I wasn't talking to her and to only talk when she's been spoken to. She doesn't get the hint. Also when she hears her name on the Alexia commercials she responds. Overall I really like this contraption. It's pretty neat. It tells me anything I want to know. She even sang me the alphabet like William Shatner one day. She hasn't done it since. We liked her so much we got another one for upstairs. Alexia even controls our lights. Our house is basically automated. ",
"this is me","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"Absolutely love these. We bought the tall Echo. Got on the list before it came out. Then we bought a dot for our shop, Then we went back and bought the deal that was buy 5 get 1 free. These are amazing. We have one for almost every room. Although, I do not advise that. Reason being is that when you say &#34;Alexa, what is the forecast&#34; and loud enough, &#34;all&#34; of them start giving you the forecast...lol So, we keep them spread out. We also gave a couple to our adult kids for Christmas.    Great for helping to figure out math problems, telling jokes and you can even order amazon items from your echo. There is so much the echo dot can do. They are a must have.    PROS:  the clarity is very good.  the compact size is perfect  you can ask almost anything and he will have the answer    CONS:  my only con is that they sometimes wake up without us even talking.    But, these are highly recommended for sure. ",
Emery,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"so I have had alexa for just over  month and at first I loved it.

Also it stopped syncing with my amazon prime music and pandora stations......now it says I need to be an amazon prime member, but when I check my aet up....it still shows my prime information. What a waste of money. I should have just tried a bigger one and maybe the speakers would have been betted too. horrible when tryibg to listen to the news updates at the dinner table and alexa is only 10 feet away and you cant hear what she is saying over any sound.

"Adam Jerome White","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"If I were to rate this on its potential alone, I would rate it 5 stars.  But there just isn't the functionality now for it to be useful for 5 stars.  It has some really cool features, and I am sure in the future it will have more.  At that point I will come back and adjust my rating to make it a better rating.    For now I will tell you what I can do with it.  One cool feature is just playing music, I have it hooked up to an AMP, and into speakers in my ceiling.  I say &#34;Alexa play XXXX&#34; and the music starts.  It pretty much plays whatever I ask for, I guess it is included in a prime membership, because I am not paying for any additional service.  I have a Wink Hub 2 and Wink Relay, so I can turn on and off lights in the house, including the fireplace, with Alexa.

"Art Harrington","March 9, 2017 ",3.0,"What can I say about the Echo Dot 2nd gen that you don't all ready know? I have 2 of these and love them. I have one in the kitchen and one in the garage. The one in the kitchen is connected to a external speaker. I have had this Sharper Image speaker for about 4 years and have hardly used it as it was a bday gift from my brother but when I decided to hook an external speaker to my Dot I totally didn't immediately think to use this speaker and now I use it everyday! Even though it is bluetooth i use the audio cable The sound is great when connected to my Sharper Image podium speaker. I don't have an external speaker connected to my garage Echo Dot as of yet but need to because the sound from the Dot is not efficient at all or loud. I have a Echo in my bedroom and the speaker is way more powerful than the Dot and even though you can't use an external speaker with the Echo, I don't think I would anyway. I also use my Amazon Echo and Dot's to control my lights. Setting up Echo Dot was easy and simple even a grandma with no tech skills can do it if you simple follow the directions on the Amazon Alexa app. Have Fun! ",
ultra55371d,"December 21, 2016 ",5.0,"I am really liking this device so far.  Ever since the echo came out a couple of years ago, I wanted one, but it was just a little too expensive to experiment with.  With the lower cost of the Dot, the option to use a better speaker system and all the benefits of the full size Echo, this was a easy purchase.    I purchased the kit deal with the Phillips Hue Bridge and lights.  In addition, I purchased another 2 Phillips Hue bulbs and a Wemo smart plug.  the setup and installation of everything was very simple and didn't take long at all.  It is now very convenient to control the lighting in our our room and bathroom now.  The hardest thing to remember is not to use the switches anymore.    Another advantage the Dot has over the Echo is the ability to use a better speaker system.  I hooked ours up to a Logictech Z623 2.1 speaker system and it sounds beyond awesome.  I have both a Prime membership and a Spotify account.  Listening to Spotify now is very enjoyable.    There is a little learning curve on how to speak to the Dot, but we're all getting the hang of it.  I will be adding more Dots and other home automation devices to my home in the near future.  So far this has been a great experience and wonderful product.  I almost purchased the new Google Voice, but very happy I didn't since initial reviews are not that great and it sounds like they released it a bit too soon.  The Echo / Dot program has been around for years, has many partners and the possibilities are almost endless with these devices.  Very happy camper! ",
"P. Bruderer","April 21, 2017 ",5.0,"Really impressed with this.  When I got my first iPhone 4s with Siri, I was pretty disappointed in her limited capabilities, and the speech recognition was not that great.  I had the opposite reaction with Alexa.  Her speech recognition is excellent, even from someone who has english as a 2nd language, or talking to Alexa from an adjacent room, or with a lot of background noise.  I don't think I've ever had her misunderstand my command.    The functionality of Alexa with all my WINK smart home devices is great.  Controlling everything through voice is very handy and fast with Alexa.  Another thing I didn't anticipate is how much I prefer playing music on Alexa over using my phone.  With Alexa when I want to play a different song or skip to the next song on my playlist or Pandora station, I just tell her to do it, I don't have to press any buttons.  Very handy when you're busy working on a task.    Alexa met and exceeded all my expectations.  There's a few quirks on what she can control within whatever smarthome hub you're using, but a quick google search resolved all the issues I encountered. ",
"Amazon Customer","November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"This is the thing you didn't know you needed but soon discover you cant live without!!! Does what it says it will and more! Alexa even has a sense of humor.  You will need to hook it up to a speaker, sound bar, etc for music as it says.  The price is great & affordable enough to put one in every room!  We love having one in the bathroom so while we are taking showers we can get traffic,weather,and news while getting ready for work without having to stop and mess with our phones.  I have one in my workshop because I do a lot of painting & wood work so its been awesome being able to play music, listen to audible and for those that don't have audible Alexa will read your kindle books, it wont be near as good as voice actors tho & she will spell some words out instead of pronouncing  them.  For lite reading like recipes while cooking, etc works great ! Would be nice if there was an app we could get to give Alexa the ability to read like audible, soon I'm sure!  She will access audible though, I just give her the command & its done.  I have Pandora &  she will bring up my custom playlists as well.  She will give traffic reports specific to your personal route to work, once you set up the addresses in the Alexa app.  Which is nice to know while you're getting ready that you have a detour and need to leave a few minutes early without having to sit and wait on the news.

W,"March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"This baby Echo is still learning to walk. I have the big Echo and love it. Sadly, the Echo Dot I bought only worked half of the time.

Commenting on the product when it DID work, it was okay at best. &#34;Alexa&#34; functions are great (as with the big Echo), but the build quality is below my expectations; it looks, feels, and sounds like a cheap, light piece of plastic to me.

"L. Sackman","December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"My teen wanted this for Christmas so I bought two, one of each of us.  I'm glad I did.  I can get corny jokes, interesting facts, a story read to me from my book list (I listen to a chapter or two a night before going to sleep), a wake-up call, a timer, wonderful music to listen to and easy ordering as well as specials.  I am having thermostats which work with Alexa installed and next will be getting the light bulbs for her to turn on.  Slowly but surely our house is turning into a 'smart' house and it all started with Alexa.  My teen loves that it's portable so it can go out side on our patio and play music there.    Why the Echo Dot rather than the Echo?  We pretty much live on two levels so decided two &#34;Dots&#34; would work better than one Echo.  Given that the music choices of my teen and myself as so vastly different, this has worked out well for us.  We might need one more for the lights but until we get them to see if they are in range, I won't know.  I will probably get the third anyway as it will make it easier for background music to be available in the common areas. ",
Matthew,"February 3, 2017 ",2.0,"I have anot echo and a dot. I love them both. The speaker on this is better than advertised, I believe. It's not bad for music but is obviously not as good as the full echo. Alexa is wonderful and the features are very useful. I look forward to there being new skills added, but that depends on 3rd parties more than amazon. It's great in the morning's for some quick news and handling those random thoughts throughout the day. ",
"Just me","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I am a big amazon fan and I depend on reviews. Let me start by saying I was so excited about this product even though my spouse was saying it will only make me lazy..Lol. I know there are several reviews on this product but here goes...I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen basically for the 2- level of our home; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive bigger one and too good to pass up. The Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the 2 floor!  Day 1 when I received it I was a little worried that I would need to send it back because Alexas first word would not sound; for example I would ask &#34;Alexa what time is it?&#34; and she would say &#34;Is 7:30pm&#34; or I would ask &#34;Tell me a joke&#34; and she would not say the first part of the joke, I asked &#34;how old are you?&#34; and the whole human part would not sound. FYI: you can read the answers on your app as well, that's how I knew I missed that part. The next day I came home and some kind of way she was answering all of the questions. I don't know if she just needed to be full charged or what, but the problem fixed itself.  I am really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. Considering everything, for $49 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to building your smart home, home automation and voice recognition technology. Overall, I would highly recommend this product. ",
"Diane J Owen","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Alexa goes in spurts in my house. She's probably lonely, cause I like quiet and I forget about her. But, she's really good at playing music--I hooked her up to my speakers. She's fun to play games with. Amazon sends ideas all the time, like ordering special deals, or music playlist. They enable new skills, like apps, all the time. I like Magic 8 Ball. Ask her if Trump will last four years. Anyway, well worth her small investment. ",
"Fan of His Royal Badness","March 8, 2017 ",4.0,"Got it for one of my kids.  The kid uses this as an alarm clock, to turn lights on and off with the&nbsp;TP-Link Smart Plug, No Hub Required, Wi-Fi, Control your Devices from Anywhere, Works w/ Amazon Alexa & Google Assistant (HS100), we also have it linked to our&nbsp;Nest Learning Thermostat, 3rd Generation, Works with Amazon Alexa]    The kids use it with a streaming music service one of the ones that is popular.  There is information on the services that work with Echo.  I know of a service my friends use that does not work with Echo if  you use that service you may want to check out the Google Home speaker.    The speaker is not great so I would suggest pairing it with a BlueTooth speaker because the sound is not great as a stand alone.  I got the [[ASIN:B013GBRR32 Philips BT6000R/37 Splash-Proof Wireless Portable Speaker (Red)&nbsp;from Amazon and the Dot sounds much better and the speaker is splash proof which a more durable choice for a kid.  Amazon also has colorful&nbsp;Amazon Echo Dot Case (fits Echo Dot 2nd Generation only) - Indigo Fabric&nbsp;to match room decor.    For those concerned about privacy (like a few of my friends) just unplug when you don't want the device to listen in on your conversations or activities.  Great choice, kid friendly, and has a lot of options for automating your home. ",
"Matthew Pence","March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is a bit...special.  I can give the echo dot a command, the command will fail, then I can reissue the same command with the same inflection and no background noise...with success?    The search functionality is limited.  I can't ask a conversational question (&#34;Alexa, why can't I use you to search the internet&#34;).  However, it does function really well as a vocal clock. (&#34;Alexa, time&#34;)    No apparent ability to control colors or scenes on my Philips Hue system.  :-/    The connection to Prime music works well with my home theater.  Alexa is good at finding music that I ask for. ",
Annadolyn,"April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"We had this for approximately a day and a half before starting the return process and buying Google Home instead. Google Home, running on Google (obviously), is so much more robust and functional than Alexa, that runs on Bing (who uses Bing??). Google can answer so many more questions, making it so much more functional/usable. Almost every response Alexa made was &#34;I'm sorry, I don't understand.&#34; I highly recommend Google Home instead. ",
"Carol Johnson","April 13, 2017 ",3.0,"This is wonderful! Alexa is a personal helper who is always eager to answer. She gives me the weather reports, the daily news briefs,  the time, sets alarms and timers, plays games, tells jokes, answers questions, plays music and more! When she plays music, she will tell me the title and artist when I ask. I understand that I can add a speaker to the Dot but I think the sound is great just the way it is. Very good quality! It has volume setting from one to ten. Just ask her to set the number you prefer. Everything is done with your voice. She even turns my bedroom light on and off when I ask. Be sure to say good morning, she will always tell you something! I got this for my blind, elderly mother and it has been a life changing experience for mother. Alexa is her companion. ",
Adrian,"January 10, 2017 ",2.0,"This is a slightly useful device. It's ok for asking web search info items , like weather or scores, and a few other things.  I had a lot of problems connecting to it initially, becuase I use 2-factor authentication on my account and by the time I had gone to my authenticator app and got a code, returned to Alexa app and gone through the login process again, the code expired. I had to turn off 2-factor on my account, and even then it made me do a capcha that was complicated by the fact that the app won't scroll, so I was typing in the capcha field blind. Thanks for the frustration, Alexa. I have secure physical possession of both devices, why can't the process be much easier?  I have a Harmony hub for AV control, and Alexa can use it. Once again, connection problems abound, as the Alexa app insisted that I didn't have a Harmony hub, even though the Harmony app is on the very same phone that Alexa app is on. Eventually I was successful. Then came the sad discovery that all it can do is turn AV gear on and off. There went my dream of tuning my dvr by voice command. More frustration.  So then I linked my Spotify account to have it play thru bluetooth speakers. This works, but every time I return to play music again, I have to manually make spotify use the bluetooth speakers, as it defaults to using the Dot speaker. Haven't found a work-around yet. Thanks for nothing, Alexa.  As far as simple voice commands, it works about 80% of the time. Sometimes it ignores me, sometimes it whines about the internet connection. I live in a rural neighborhood that's not too badly wifi congested. My cell phone stays connected anywhere on my property but Alexa struggles from a 30 foot distance to my wifi router. It randomly announces when it connects to the wifi or bluetooth. It reacts to what it hears on TV sometimes(yes I have done the voice training), which leads to baffling announcements. I say 'Alexa, shut up&#34; a lot.  In summary, this would be a good deal at $19. Too bad it cost $50.  I'll keep it, but it doesn't really do anything my Nexus 6 won't do with the &#34;OK Google&#34; function. Amazon is a major cloud provider, why can't they put a good web app up for connecting and configuring and linking?  I can't recommend this device unless you are a 'smart home' hobbyist who wants to spend money linking it to Zwave or Zigbee devices.  UPDATE: I decided to keep this and use it as a voice commanded search engine for simple questions, but its results have been poor. I will be returning it as being nearly useless to me.  When it failed to answer a question, I repeated the question to Ok Google on my phone, and in all cases it was able to answer. Here are some of those questions:  1. When was the piano invented?  2. Who was Field Marshal von Rundstedt?  3. What is maximum allowed length of a golf club?  I'm not interested in using this as am Amazon shopping tool, which it is probably good at. I'm sending it back. ",
"Kar Chow","December 8, 2016 ",5.0,"I always want to buy Echo but it is too expensive to try out. And here we go, Echo dot is out. Same function with Echo and even more for only $49.99. So why not give it a try?    I have install Philips Hue for a while with my iPhone for controls, now with Echo dot, I no longer need to get out from my bed and walk to my charging iPhone and turn the light off and back to bed. Just a simple commend &#34;Alexa, turn master room off.&#34; Making my life so ez.    And of course the Audible for only $14.99 a month, and you have a free trial for a month and two free books of your choice!(after free trial it is going to cost $14.99 per month but you get a free credit for any book!)    And then Music! You can add up to 250 songs to the amazon music cloud and hear it anywhere with your echo dot. FOR FREE! It can be any songs you bought digital from any source, google, itunes you name it. And if you have reach the limit for 250 songs, you can just pay as little as $7.99 a month for ulimate and Amazon Music is free to listen too!    And yeah you can ask question that you want to know the answer, from a country, a person, an animal, a place, or any facts etc. And Alexa is just so smart to answer everything and Alexa is learning day to day with new skills.    So are you still thinking? $49.99 just the price of one outside dinner for 2 person and you can bring a Smart technology home.    P.S. now I have bought three Amazon echo dot, one at living room, two in rooms. ",
timdtoolman,"January 27, 2017 ",2.0,"Love it!! Works extremely well. I wanted to start getting into &#34;Smart Home&#34; technology and although I can use Siri on my iphone to do the same thing the Echo dot does sometimes my phone is in my pocket so I am not able to communicate with Siri, that's where the Elixa and the Echo Dot comes in handy. I have not seen hardly any negative reviews on YouTube for the Echo line and the Echo Dot is an inexpensive way to get into this new personal assistant space. The Echo Dot does have a speaker that will allow you to communicate with Elixa but if you intend on listening to music you will want to connect a external speaker via aux. cable or bluetooth which is very easy to connect using the Elixa app. After using the Echo Dot for about a week now I have been very impressed with it's voice recognition skills as they are extremely reliable and very well implemented.    With Elixa you can get the weather forecast,  listen to music of any kind, ( $3 a mo. prime music membership required) control almost anything in your home with the proper components (sold separately) and so far I just use Elixa to turn on and off my bedroom lights by just speaking which is so cool.    I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get into the personal assistant technology, you will not be disappointed. ",
"Michael G. Fisher","October 25, 2016 ",5.0,"While we are still trying to figure out all it can do and how best to ask it what we want, we are amused by it and sometimes frustrated by it.  The reason I gave it 5 stars is because of an unexpected benefit.  Our oldest daughter has a pretty challenging speech impediment and using Alexa has forced her to slow down and enunciate clearly.  Not only is Alexa learning how to understand my daughter, my daughter is also slowing down and learning to communicate with Alexa.  The huge benefit is she is now slowing down to communicate more clearly with us.  This is something her speech therapists have been working on with her for years.  Alexa has gotten these results from her in a few months.  The Echo Dot is a useful tool and will only become more useful as its capabilities grow.  Thank you, Amazon. ",
"DFW Bill","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought two dots and was extremely disappointed that features like alarms and timers could not be synchronized across the dots.  I am giving this two stars ONLY because the dots do not communicate with each other for several important features (otherwise I would give this 5 stars).  For instance, when I set a timer or alarm on one dot, I really want the timer to sound on other dots in other parts of the house.  If Amazon provided an option to synchronize functions like the timers and alarms, this would be a great system.  Amazon could you please provide the option to synchronize on your next software update? ",
"Charles D","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This product is by far the best Smart Home device I have purchased. The only part to get used to is learning what to say to get the desired results. That is the learning curve, which I think is kind of fun to me. Naming all of your devices is fun to do even more so if your creative with naming them. It connects with my wink hub and all of my other connected devices. It has a ton of useful features to make your everyday life much easier and efficient.    My wife loves it as well, she did not know what to think at first but that quickly changed once she learned how to make her shopping list jut by talking to alexa. I really enjoy the ease of playing music. This is the link to make your smart home truly smart. ",
"Roland W.","April 12, 2017 ",2.0,"&nbsp;Ok, the idea of not having to type your questions and getting pretty good and accurate answers (most of the time) is pretty amazing.  Set up was very easy, just download the Alexa App and then follow the step by step WIFI set up instructions. Right now I am only using it for basic requests (see video) and that works well. I will keep adding skills (these are additional little programs you can enable on the amazon.com website Just search &#34;Alexa Skills&#34; in the amazon search bar and it routes you to the menu. You can add sports teams, kids games etc. Alexa can tell you jokes (most of them are pretty funny and all so far are kid friendly).  Speaker quality is ok for such a small device - you can plug in an external speaker directly into the Dot and then you can control it through the Dot. I have a Sonos System (whole house), and I would have to get a separate DOT to plug into the sonos in my media centre, so the Dots can communicate. Have not done that so far. But it is a lot of fun to play around, get weather, movie times, play some background music or meditation songs etc. Just play around with it. I have a &#34;slight&#34; accent and it understands me without a problem.  Just be prepared that kids will yell at this little thing, demanding answers and a play buddy who gives them honest feedback on how their hair looks today :)    Currently I am using it mostly as a toy, but as my house is already rather high tech with everything wireless from thermostate (Lennox, which does not connect to ALEXA yet - per customer service) to security camera, Hue lights in some areas, I am planning on expanding the in house Dot Network over the coming months when manufacturers add more functionalities. I keep you posted.    I went on Amazon Skill website and enabled a ton of skills. Just make sure you write down how to activate them. (play 20 words, the secret door, bed time story etc.... you can have a lot of fun with these. I will get one for my daughters room so she can get &#34;Alexa, play relaxing songs for 15 minutes&#34; at bed time.

Greg,"November 5, 2016 ",5.0,"Totally Awesome, if only using to listen to music and making to-do/grocery lists!!!  I no longer have to use my phone or tablet to listen to music at home, once set up these are completely independent of your phone/tablet.  Definitely recommend the Echo Dot/Bluetooth speaker combo especially with a speaker that sounds good.  So convenient to walk into a room and say &#34;play whatever you want to hear&#34; and say &#34;what volume level you want&#34;.  The To-Do and Grocery List is a huge plus, whenever you think of something just say it and it goes on your list, if you're not home and the wife or kids need something they can just tell Alexa and it gets on your list.  So many more things it can do, highly recommend. ",
"Brandon R.","January 19, 2017 ",5.0,"This little Gadget is awesome. I gave it 5 stars because it does what it says and it works very well. Now it was very easy to hook up handworks just fine. Now I know this is on you product and the skills are limited and they're making new skills for it. It can insult you, it can make you laugh, which it has plenty of times. My whole family uses it whenever they passed by they asked for a joke they are funny. The your mama jokes are funny too. This would be even better if it has skills for information it is limited to what it can do what is a very fun Gadget to play . I've used it to play music, I've also used it to ask the time to set reminders it's capable of doing lots of things looking forward to new skills there are so many things that I can do. If you get one which I recommend play with the app to get the skills you want and use it. There is no battery so you can't move it around the house unless you unplug it or buy a battery pack that I believe they sell for it to move it around the house. You cannot take it with you at least outside of your Wi-Fi range. Would be cool if you can take this wherever you go and use it if you can I haven't figured that out yet. yet that will be super cool it comes with its own plug for powering it up and to connect to a separate speaker if you want. As for the way it sounds you can control the volume on the echo Dot and you can also connected to a Bluetooth speaker you can also connect your cell phone to it or tablet Android volume off of the echo Dot. I like the volume that it has I don't use a Bluetooth speaker I don't think you need it unless you want it louder. I DJ so I can connect it to my system and get more volume butt no need for it it's loud enough for me. It's a little bigger than a hockey puck I have it in white. It comes in different colors they have a couple of accessories you can buy for it. This by far is the coolest Gadget I've gotten for myself. I definitely recommend this for everyone that has Wi-Fi. If you get one play with it and enjoy lots of fun. ",
"Damian Jaundoo","October 31, 2016 ",5.0,"I remember star trek and wanting the ability to speak to the computer and it would do what i ask or give me the answer to something. I never in my lifetime ever thought that technology would arrive and be affordable. Well the ECHO is flat out an awesome product. I got the first one as a gift and purchased a second along with smart plugs and plan on buying more related items to add on. It is just wonderful and while new it is not only functional and usable it gets better. Since its cloud based you dont have to worry about technology getting more advanced and making this out dated it just keeps getting better with more features. the way i see it eventually it will be in every room of my house. I have two wifi routers and it will control devices on the other network. It is just so much more than i expected. If your an Amazon prime user you will not regret buying this but make sure you know what you are getting yourself into. This is just the starter product which is great by itself. You may need bluetooth speakers for large rooms smart switches and lights smart hubs etc... to complete your home so if you are willing to take that plunge understand it will get expensive as you will want to do it.

richc007,"December 9, 2016 ",5.0,"I love this device and can not see why anyone wouldn't.  Even in only its 2nd iteration, its fantastic. Nothing beats being able to control electronics with your voice.    I have bought a few smart bulbs and power outlets, so far, that work flawlessly with Alexa and were super easy to setup using the app.    I paired my Harmony remote using IFTTT so I can voice command my remote control activities.    Because of the joy and desire to continue to make my house &#34;smart&#34; the proverbial Christmas list now includes a thermostat and garage door opener to name a few smart items.    I am sure the future software updates with bring tons of additional features that I will love as well.  I have already pre-orded the attachable battery as having the Dot portable will make it far more useful.  Especially when in the pool and listening to music or books.    I wont belabor the value in having all of your amazon music and audible books on voice demand.  Its just very convenient.    The amazon shopping integration is great, but not the reason I bought the echo.  I bought it so I can talk to my electronics, and it does that very very well.    Don't hesitate buying this item.  Its something you will use many times each day and I doubt you own many other things, that you use that often, that only cost you 50 bucks.    Nice job on this product Amazon. ",

I bought a 3rd one as well and gifted to my mom for xmas and she loves it. I dont know why I didn't get this in the past.    The only cons I have is the app itself. I personally think it needs to be redesigned for better simplicity and speed. The app likes to not work at times and will lag. Other than that, I wold recommend this ",

"Amazon Customer","December 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought this as a gift to my husband and I for Christmas and I love it. I am a bit of a geek, but certainly not enormously tech savvy.  Amazon has figured out how to make installation of the Echo Dot happen smoothly in under 5 minutes.  I am planning on adding a second one to our bedroom. It will be great to just set an alarm by voice, especially when it's a day where the time is different from the norm, listen to music, hear my calendar and the news, etc.  I would recommend eventually buying a bluetooth speaker though you can hook up a hardwire speaker to it.  The speaker it comes with is adequate at first if you are looking to save money initially.  Recently we bought a TP SmartLink Plug (after trying to connect a Belkin which was exasperating and didn't work) and it connected within, again, about 5 minutes at most.  My husband who isn't tech savvy loves being able to say &#34;Living Room on&#34; and having the lights turn on, especially since he has mobility issues.  Alexa, how did we live without you? ",
DS0078,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Been an IT guy for 20+ years. I also install audio/visual systems like Control4. So I am not easily impressed. I put off buying an Alexa device for some time and finally broke down to &#34;try one out&#34; just for the hell of it. So I bought a Dot because I have at least 5 small powered speakers around the house and garage. But let me tell you, this thing is freaking scary cool! I feel like I am in an episode of Star Trek (yes I am that old). First off I am a Prime member, so I ask for music and it plays music. I linked my Pandora account. I asked for Alexa to play Stevie Ray Vaughn from my Pandora account. She replied with, You do not have a Stevie Ray Vaughn station, would you like for me to add one? I said Yes. She added and started playing. Freaking cool! I am also an active stock trader so I asked for stock quotes and she was not able to answer that. Keep in mind this technology is in its infancy! I can only imagine what I will be able to control or ask in the near future?!?! I like the idea of the Alexa with the built in speaker but 179.00 is kind of high in my opinion when powered speakers are so cheap. The only thing is you need two outlets to power both when you buy a DOT vs the Alexa with a speaker..... But to start out and give this thing a try, WOW is all I can say about the DOT right now. VERY impressed. ",

Terry,"November 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my echo dot. Having a hands free remote control is truly helpful from setting timers to smart home control. The other day my power had gone out overnight and I kept thinking I should set my stove clock every time I walked by but didn't have my phone. Duh! Alexa what time is it. Fixed. I'm getting older and it's easy to space on the shopping list. Alexa, add milk to the shopping list. Then when at the store I just open the Alexa app and look at my shopping list. Fixed. I think Alexa is going to be my new best friend. Lol. My setup is using a Hook SmartHome server with etekcity switches. The advantage is the cost. The hook talks wifi to rf. The etekcity switches are rf and only $5 per outlet vs. $35-40 for wemo. So now Alexa turn tv on, Alexa turn living room light on. Love it! Now if only Next up when budget allows will be a Logitech Harmony - wifi to IR to control the apple tv, dvd player etc. Alexa Channel 5. Alexa pause movie. Now if only I could find inexpensive light controls. Alexa Night mode! Someday.    Oh, and Alexa is really awesome at picking music for me, I've listened to a bunch of new artists and the idea of needing to work on a playlist is vanished. Alexa Music! And so easy to Alexa Skip or Alexa Thumbs Up. Five Stars - but would give 10 if I could.    P.S. I gave some thought to purchasing Echo instead but had some speakers so went with the dot. I'm glad I did. Not only less expensive I've found that sometimes Alexa can struggle hearing the wake up word if the speakers are close and loud so I plan on keeping the dot at a bit of distance from the speakers. The Dot is fabulous at hearing the wake up word over the tv and managed well even when I had a cold.. ",
MityMike,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Setup was very easy and I enjoy the Dot so far. Voice recognition is great and I used it to stream my music, as a kitchen timer, to set alarms and to read the news or ask for the weather. It does not stream Audible books that have not been downloaded and the Audible Streaming in Amazon Prime does not read your books back. It does not support Airplay and some Bluetooth speaker have streaming interruptions which are probably due to power saving settings of the speaker, not the Dot. However, you have better sound quality when connecting the Dot via a 3.5mm audio cable. remember though, that if a Bluetooth speaker is paired via Bluetooth, it does not switch back to the cable connection automatically. It told me it added Bing to my Alexa applications, when it did not understand what I was looking for and I cannot find Bing anywhere. I am still not sure if I would trust Amazon purchasing through voice completely. Some of the Alexa applications are useless and you have to address them by voice for the Dot to find the right answer &#34;Alexa, ask soandso app for information on...&#34; which means you have to know the Alexa skills out of the top of your head. So overall, a nice help, but still has a long way to go. ",

"A Reader","November 28, 2016 ",4.0,"I bought two dots to serve as devices that could easily play music and news etc. without having to plug my phone into a speaker.  They work OK in this respect; I have them linked up to spotify, and they manage that fine, although I find that 50% of the time I need to go and use the Spotify app, because my voice commands aren't understood right (Alexa is often unwilling to play a Spotify playlist, for example; and she seems unable to understand a request like &#34;play the new album by ___&#34;  But a couple of serious problems.  First, one major feature I want is the ability to play podcasts.  This seems obvious, right?  In theory, Alexa supports this via TuneIn.  But I've gotten it to work only a handful of times.  You should be able to say &#34;play the program ___&#34;.  Often Alexa will identify what I want to hear, tell me she is getting the latest episode--and then nothing happens.  Very frustrating.  The other thing I find annoying is the way bluetooth is implemented.  I started connecting my phone via Bluetooth to play podcasts.  But then whenever I entered the room, I got a very annoying and loud message from Alexa about how she was connected to my phone.  Extremely annoying.  These are basic features; I don't want anything fancy.  I just want this device to be able to play podcasts and to be usable as a not-annoying bluetooth device. ",

SundayAtDusk,"April 11, 2017 ",2.0,"This was a Christmas present for my elder mother. We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device. ",
"Rik Conaghan","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My wife received one of these for Christmas, and even though i am a techie kind of guy, I had never really seen a use for these. Now fast forward to March, they seem to have multiplied, and I now have 5 of these creatures living in various rooms throughout the house (this is the issue part :-)) they have been far more useful than i would have thought.    We have one in the Kitchen, which serves not only as musical accompaniment to our culinary activities, but as a personal shopping assistant to help maintain the shopping list. It sits there, ever faithful, just waiting for me to pull a product from the cupboard, realize it is the last one, then either add it to the shopping list we use to go to the store, or to go ahead and order it directly from Amazon. You really can't get much more convenient than that, especially as our minds aren't quite as sharp as they used to be (well we do have 2 young kids....)    We have three more in the bedrooms, they are used for playing music (built in speaker is more than adequate for our daughters audio needs, plus they both love talking to Alexa and having complete control of what they listen to) they also are being used for alarms (useful on school-day mornings!) and our 5 year old has been probing Alexa to answer some of the questions that pop into her head about various subjects (the meaning of life, quantum mechanics, M-theory, who is the guy dressed in the Barney suit, etc...) We have one in our bedroom for the same reasons, but also use the Bluetooth option to switch between playing music in the bedroom and the bathroom while taking a shower (just turning the Bluetooth speaker on in the bathroom moves the audio playback from the Dot to the speaker in the bathroom, then back to the dot again after the speaker is turned off again) so the music follows us wherever we may roam.    Our latest addition to the Dot family resides in our dining room, we like to have some music in the background while we eat, and the Dot covers this role nicely also.    Excellent little gizmo's and, i am sure, will multiply again as soon as we discover a &#34;need&#34; to have one of these in a different room in the house. For the price of these things, what is there not to like? ",

"M and M","March 20, 2017 ",5.0,"I got my dot today, i was pleasantly surprised to see how well it was made .  and that it took minutes  to hook up. After my dot did it's little light dance,  i started the app., from there it took less than 30 sec.. i needed to change something in the settings but i was given a highlighted word that took me right to it, i did what i had to do and i was connected.  Super fast. The 1st thing i asked alexa to do was play Christmas music,  i was so happy,  it's dec 22nd and it was the 1st time i heard a Christmas song this year with working full time and when I'm not working,  I'm a caregiver,  it just slips my mind. Alexa has told me jokes,  which i needed.  The weather and how many calories were in an orange lol.  I love this little thing so much that If it was a male voice,  I'd be shopping for a wedding band lol. I was concerned about the sound but it's great, it's clear, even when you raise the volume.

Dia,"April 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is a lot of fun. I have added some of her skills but they don't seem to function as expected. She only speaks English, which while I can understand programming another language could've been a huge investment, it's still a disadvantage.

Asking her to set a timer is really convenient  `shopping list. She can add items to your shopping list which you can view on your smartphone when out of the house. For this forget-everything-gal, that feature is really helpful.  `controlling it with the app. My husband still doesn't know how I can turn down the music from the other room - or turn it on.

I lost the expectation of having an intellectual conversation with her but I expect her to not talk back or at least apologize and ask me how she can make me happy.

"Amazon Customer","December 27, 2016 ",2.0,"Echo vs Echo Dot.. I started off buying an Echo for my bedroom which is where I listen to music the most. After a lot of thought I figured I would buy a dot for my kitchen because the Echo is no where within ear shot. Now having owned both for a couple of months here is my opinion. If you like to listen to your music loud, you like to sing along, in the middle of this singing fest you want to know what the weather is.. firmly say Alexa what's the weather like? and you're good to go. In those situations a full size Echo is a must.. The Echo Dot owner never really puts the volume past 2-3. If you put the volume anything higher than a 3 (4 if you're lucky) I find myself screaming at Alexa to turn off. I will keep my Dot simply because I can't justify spending $200 on an Echo for the kitchen. For $50 it is pretty reasonable. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 6, 2017 ",5.0,"I thoughtful Echo was interesting, but wanted to opt with just the Dot and use my own Bluetooth speakers. Unfortunately, Amazon discontinued the first generation just as I was able to order.  When the second generation was announced, I knew I'd get one.  With the $10/ month for 5 month plan for Prime members, it was a no trainer. Although I'm more heavily into Apple's ecosystem, and gave smart appliances (Apple)  they will work with Alexander too.  There is quite a bit of crossover. I'm excited and look forward even using the Dot as an alarm clock, awakening me with my Prime Music. I'm sure it's going to be loads of other fun too. I also have a Kindle Fire HDX, FireStick, etc, and know it will integrate nicely.    I have had it for about a week and it's VERY cool!  Does so much more than even Siri by being able to add skills. Also works great with my iDevices switched simulataneously with iOS HomeKit. This was a great buy! ",
Hopels,"April 18, 2017 ",3.0,"Replaced the larger Alexa Echo with the Dot 2nd Gen.  Obviously the much smaller size is nice.  I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.    The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.    We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.    Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.  I took off one star because while I have no issues with it, it sometimes doesn't &#34;hear&#34; my wife. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"I love the size and the price but the speaker is horrible. I have seen better speakers in smaller things so it's not like it can't be done. I can say that the microphone is really well-made it can pick my voice up 20 feet away in the Next Room  at  moderate levels  without having to yell. Like the Alexa, I wish it was more informative, there are so many questions I asked that Alexa does not know the answer to but Google does. I also wish that a lot of the apps were not third party where you have to ask Alexa to ask the app to do something like my buddy you have to say Alexa ask my buddy to send an alert message to a family member because I have fallen and can't get up it would be nice if you could say Alexa contact my family member and tell them I have fallen and cannot get up. But aside from that I love the direction that it's heading, I just wish it was there already we have the technology to make it happen I can only assume there's red tape involved ",
AdventureGirl,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I wanted black but it was backordered. I didn't want to wait so ordered the white. I ordered three.

I am about to order another 4 for my mom, dad, another brother, and a friend. The part that I have become obsessed with is the alarm. My brother is incredibly good at figuring out how to use tech in ways I do not have the patience for. I sent him one so I could steal his tips and tricks. It worked. I use it for Amazon Kindle, spotify, audible, uber, to ask questions, to schedule events, and create my shopping list. Great product.

I'll be picking up another for upstairs on the black Friday sale. I'll  wait a while to get LED bulbs etc. They are still first generation and over priced.

Speech recognition is very powerful and quite accurate, especially compared to the technology just a few ars back.  The sound is also very adequate for such a small device but the well programmed bluetooth feature connects automatically to my soundbar when it is turned on.

The speaker in it is fair, but that is what it suppose to be.  I easily connected it to a higher quality bluetooth speaker and that made it sound very nice.  This provides a very inexpensive way of starting out with an AI in one's home.  I would surely purchase this item again.  I have also purchased recently the Google Home AI and surely they are different items aimed at satisfying the user needs in different ways.  The one thing I can say about the Google Home so far is that the speaker sucks.  The full Echo has much better sound quality.  I am truly excited to see how this addiction to the home AI experience affects the future of home AI experiences. ",

Sebae7,"November 14, 2016 ",5.0,"I don't usually take time to do reviews but am breaking that rule for the Echo Dot. It is by far the best voice recognition I have encountered and I've tried a lot. I seem to have an odd voice that most can't properly pick up on. Sync in cars or other systems like Toyota Entune are useless for me and yet others can get in my car and do ok. Alexa has not misunderstood me one time yet. That in itself is amazing to me. I'm not a power user by any means, for me it's a 50 dollar device that I use to listen to music, set my alarms, get weather info and news, etc. Control a couple lights in the house as well. I'd pay the 50 bucks just for the music aspect. &#34;Alexa, Play James Taylor&#34; and I instantly get a variety of his music. I was hooked right there.

"The Nurbler","April 9, 2017 ",5.0,"I have two of these, and the one feature I was most hoping for is described on this amazon help page https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202013740 like this:    &#34;Note: You cannot connect multiple Alexa devices to each other and play the same requested audio at the same time.&#34;    Since these things have speakers and can stream audio, it is only natural to wish that I could stream my Pandora (or other) music to all of the Echos I own at the same time, in sync.

"Amazon Customer","March 15, 2017 ",5.0,"For music lovers - DO NOT agree to Alexa's suggestion for Amazon Music Unlimited unless you don't mind a monthly fee.  The Alexa voice suggested Amazon Music Unlimited, and it inquired if I wanted to subscribe. I clearly enunciated NO - twice - but it still signed me up as a member. This means there is an automatic monthly payment to them.  I was signed up for something I did not want, and then I had to look around for how to cancel it in order to not have recurring charges.  The question &#34;do you want Amazon Music Unlimited&#34; is the equivalent of a lie when one becomes enrolled by answering NO.  Marketing really means manipulating, and Amazon is a giant - globally - for this.  As always - for any product by any company - buyer beware of any way a corporation can screw you.  So far, there is no difference between features on Echo and my phone unless I wanted to ask a device to turn my lights off. ",

310EI,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"We bought an Echo Dot as an early Christmas gift to ourselves and we're so glad that we did.  It's a very useful gadget because there's such a wide variety of things we can ask Alexa to answer or tasks that she can do for us (eg: alarms/timers, calendar, ordering, weather).    Since one of the tasks that we wanted Alexa to do for us was play music, we subscribed to Amazon's Unlimited Music Plan for the Echo Dot.  It's well worth the low monthly fee to be able to ask Alexa to play any song or album anytime, without having to buy all of them individually.    ​Millions of songs are available through one groovy gadget (and the Unlimited Music Plan).    We have the Echo Dot in our home and listen to music without any external speakers.  As far as we're concerned, the internal speaker emits a decent array of sound.  Is it as robust sounding as hooking it up to our surround system amplifier or other external speakers?  Of course not, but it does sound a lot better than most internal device speakers of similar size.  For those of you that don't like the internal speaker, you can utilize the 3.5mm or Bluetooth speaker options.    If we say, “Alexa, Play The Top Songs by Phil Collins”... then that's exactly what she does.    Keep in mind that when you ask Alexa for the &#34;Top Songs&#34; by a soloist or group, they may not always be your favorite songs.  A work around for that is to ask Alexa to play a particular album that contains the songs you prefer to hear.    The screen-shots show you how we asked Alexa to play an album vs the top songs. In addition, they show you what we see when logged-in to the Alexa app via the Chrome web browser.    FYI:  When asking Alexa to play an album that has a long title, we realized that she responds accurately when we ask for part of that title (view Elton John & Michael Jackson screen-shots).  Be sure to look at what we said to Alexa vs what the whole album title is labeled.    I should mention that we did ask Alexa to search for a product, which she did along with telling us the best options and their cost.  Afterward, she asked if we wanted to buy the product.  We said yes and she placed the order for us once we gave her our confirmation code (Settings: Voice Purchasing).  We recommend setting that up so other people cannot place orders without your consent.  It's convenient for us to have voice purchasing enabled when we're &#34;unplugged&#34; at night (except for Alexa).    The skill that we use the most is Weather Sky, it gives us a detailed weather report that we use several times each day.    ​At the time of this review, we haven't used any of the smart home features, but we didn't buy it for that purpose.    PLEASE NOTE:  We purchased the Echo Dot at its listed price, we did not receive any discount to post this review. ",
"Katy B.","March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"My first echo dot my mom gave me for my birthday and I set it up, it worked for a day and lit up but did not do anything the second day.  I have never dealt with Amazon customer support before and it was not an easy process.  You get the first layer who asks standard questions and if they can't solve it you go to the second layer in which you explain everything all over again.  The reps were nice enough, sometimes hard to understand their English, but I do believe they were trying to be helpful.  My biggest issue is how many customer service people I have talked to in order to get my dot working.  Amazon shipped me another new dot and I set it up.  It answered questions, but did not play songs.  What are the chances of getting two defective dots and they had different issues.  I had to call again and get two layers of representatives, explaining all of it over again.  This was hours on the phone and even though the rep tried hard to help, he had to finally give up and send the issue to the engineers.  Then, because I had two dots, I did not get my free 30 day unlimited music trial.  I was charged immediately so I had to call customer service again!  Two more reps to get that straightened out.  It has been a little over a week and I think I finally have it working properly.  After explaining the issues so many times I was ready to tell Amazon to take it back, it is not that great of a device for all this hassle. ",

The kids love it from asking various questions to using the timer for study activities.  It also helps to speak more clearly.    We are exploring other skills like lists to be able to further use it.    One thing that we wished it had was the ability to sync to iCalendar as it only looks like it supports Outlook and google calendar.

"Cynthia J. Salim","March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"DOT can be frustrating but I do enjoy the convenience when it works. I have two DOTS and a speakers connected to each DOT. Each DOT is used on a different floor of my home. The DOT in my bedroom is connected to a speaker by WIFI also connected to that DOT is a smart plug that controls a lamp. The DOT in my living area is connected using a cable to a speaker. I intend to have smart thermostats installed and connected too. I enjoy the music selection available using DOT. And,  I enjoy the convenience of weather reports, news, time, alarms, etc.    My beef is that sometimes DOT does not work using the voice mode. I can usually get what I want by going into my ALEXA APP and making a manual request. This happens most often at night when I want to have my lamp turned off or my music turned on. I am not sure why this happens. Generally, in the morning when I try the same request that failed at night, it works. When these failures occur, I check to make sure WiFi is working and it always is. ALEXA also lights up indicating that she hears me but does not execute the request. I am starting to wonder if I have made a mistake by buying the expensive Smart thermostats.

"Bev Martin","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I purchased several of these on prime day when you could buy 4 (or was it 5) and get one free.  I now have an Echo in the main living area, a Dot in the bedroom, and a Dot in my craft room.  The others were great Christmas gifts.  The Dot works identical to the Echo except it has a much smaller speaker.  It can be connected to a blue tooth speaker, or in the case of my craft room, I have an expansive set of Bose speakers and CD player/changer (I guess it is getting a little old).  I have the Dot plugged into the Bose speakers and the sound is great. The Dot is much smaller than the Echo so in many circumstances it would be preferred over the Echo as it doesn't take up much space.  We love our Alexa(s) ",
"Nancy Banner","March 20, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought it to play music and, hooked up to our stereo, it does that well. You have to remember just what to ask for - not as simple as clicking a song or album icon on a screen - since it doesn't tell you what's available.  It also plays back Audible books fine, provided you remember the title well enough (it won't list your Audible or Kindle libraries). The one we got cannot find our Kindle library, although we have lots of tts-eligible books in it, according to the Alexa app. I'm now finding out how many calls to Amazon and time on the phone it will take to get this fixed.

I went through and added them all again and recreated my groups...still nothing so I ended up resetting it, and still no luck, the remote did not work either, I did a factory reset and still same issue, I called Amazon Support at 12:43 AM EST (they closed at 10 pm PST) when I called them, I got a message saying that Alexa was not working right and got hung up on...I tried this morning and all was well ",
"Amanda Garrison","January 9, 2017 ",3.0,"I just received this yesterday and I love it. Within an hour I had the Dot installed and the app installed and Dot connected and playing my Amazon Prime Music (I think I will upgrade to the Unlimited for the Dot, since there were songs that were that far off the beaten path that Prime Music could/would not play). Also it took me 10 minutes to install the Harmony skills for Alexa and I was operating my Harmony Hub connected equipment. I am working on getting Alexa integrated with my Homeseer HS3 soon.  I will say it is worth the time to do the voice recognition set up.  It has its limitations,  but adds convenience.  I am sure the skills and functionality will improve as time goes on. ",
"Frank V","March 7, 2017 ",4.0,"I bought this to have in my bathroom and got a wall mount (LANMU Wall Mount for Echo Dot 2nd Generation (White)) which I stuck to the mirror with a Command Strip.  I also got a very short USB cord so I don't have a long cord tangled up on the counter.  This set up works great.    The Dot itself works really well in this context.  My bathroom is not big so I can hear music or news playing while I'm in the shower almost as well as when I'm at the sink.  My only note is that I wish it was slightly louder. I know it's a much smaller speaker than its larger cousin, but I've had other portable speakers about the same size that were louder. ",
"Allen F","March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"1. I have constant connectivity problems in which the Echo Dot, while it remains connected to the internet, somehow becomes invisible to my phone and tablet. Somehow this manages to mess up my Spotify account. It took a while, but I finally figured out that I could fix this by doing a complete reset on the Echo Dot. Now, I get to do that about once a day.  2. Speech recognition lags far behind Google and even Apple. Blows my karma on a regular basis by playing heavy metal when I asked for Rachmaninov's Vocalise. Pitiful.  3. There are thousands of so-called &#34;skills&#34;, or 3rd-party apps. They are uniformly useless. Do you really want a machine that tells you jokes? ",
"M. Dembski","February 10, 2017 ",4.0,"Good first start. Good on dealing with Amazon but even there music integration is weak. Sometimes it plays just my music and sometimes prime.

Alexa frequently appears to crash. Probably too many people using. Trying to get nearest restaurant bar etc is totally inaccurate. Locations are miles further away. No way to custumize TuneIn so frequently get wrong status. Does not get logic right unless you use exact wording. I have two and both drop the Bluetooth connection occasionally.

Chromosome,"April 11, 2017 ",2.0,"In Sep 2106 I bought a second generation Echo to set up at work. I was never able to get it to work for longer than a couple of days. I think it has trouble connecting to WIFI networks that have a web page verification. We are talking about a university network that works well for everything else. It connected, but it would fall of the network. Finally, I gave up and I took it home in Marcy 2017, thinking that I would set up it there. Took a while. I was pretty disappointment until I realized that the Alexa server was down. While I was figuring this out, I looked into the warranty.  Have you tried to visit the Amazon warranty page? You should: https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201014520. Note the fine print that says &#34;..contact Customer Service using the contact information on the left side of this page&#34;. Now try looking left. There is no address (see photo). Well, one may say. It must be a mistake. Sure, but how to fix it? It took a long time (ok, maybe I am thick, but it was not obvious) to find phone support. End of the story, it is now working. It has nice features. Is it a miracle of technology? Not yet. ",
"JF Gadget Guy","November 2, 2016 ",3.0,"I ordered one of these on my vacation and have had lots of fun with it.  I don't need to stream music, so I went with the lower priced dot which has all of the features of the full priced echo, without the high quality speaker.  It was easy to set up from my iPhone and to point to my network.  Voice recognition is fantastic.  Unlike the Google Home, the device follows more specific trigger phrases, and doesn't keep context from one voice command to another, but it does an excellent job.  There are thousands of additional skills you can add - including IFTT which allows all kinds of integration with different apps and devices (including things like Harmony remote controls).    From weather forecasts, to directions, to setting reminders, alarms, timers or asking questions that get searched on the internet, it does a really good job.  For added try asking it about political figures, Siri and other AIs, or other silly questions and enjoy the answers!    I can't wait to get home and connect it with some new Samsung Smartthings devices. ",

However, like real humans, she does have downfalls. It says she will search for things on bing that she doesn't know, I can't figure out how to get her to do that. Also, her speaker sucks! My apartment is about 600 square feet and at the loudest I can't really hear her when I leave from the immediate vicinity (my dad has the regular echo and the sound quality is insane- there's no comparison). I just got her a friend - a Bluetooth speaker that I think will solve the problem.    She is pretty effin awesome though.

For now, it is indeed a useful device for things like telling me my calendar entries for the day, or the temperature outside, or for just playing a little background music.  Amusing when a TV add says &#34;Alexa&#34; (or in a show, as has happened), and the device lights up all eager to serve . ..  Ha ha!

It's also very loud for a very small device (as much so as my large Bluetooth speaker). My own two sticking points that caused me to dock a star were the lack of portability (I thought you charged the device and took it anywhere, not have to leave it attached to the wall), and the particularness that it has when connecting with WiFi. I bought this for myself at college right after we upgraded our school-sponsored WiFi, but I ended up having to find another connection because the Echo Dot doesn't link up to encrypted WiFi, or even show it on the screen.

I paired it with Amazon Music Unlimited and mobile hotspot from my phone and now i can play any song, artist, or station that i want without touching my phone and without ads.

The Dot picks up voice commands very well and functions correctly the majority of the time.  I would suggest doing a few voice trainings with Alexa as it does seem to make a big difference.

"Anakalia - Red Herring","December 25, 2016 ",3.0,"My whole family has been enjoying having Alexa around.  We're constantly asking her questions.  Some helpful and some not so helpful to some that are unknown or that she can't answer or understand.  I'm sure she'll get better and better with updates in time.    From homework, to cooking, to everyday life, traffic, stores, weather, music and silliness, we've been able to turn to her for some help and entertainment.  We've uploaded some of the &#34;skills&#34; but can't seem to remember what they're all called to access them so they're not used very often.    There's been a few times that she doesn't perk up when we talk to her but other than that, even with a Bluetooth speaker not too far away, she usually hears us over some loud music.    We're planning on getting a smart hub or some other add ons to work with her but for now, she is low key and takes up minimal space.    I am still debating whether or not to get a few more.  I would love one in my room and I know a couple of people who would like one under the Christmas tree. ",
Dinnerplate,"February 7, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is pretty useless for the most part. She is good at telling me what time it is, setting a timer while cooking or an alarm. Half the time for music she doesn't know what you are asking for so its easier to just use my phone on a speaker. If you are buying the Dot because you want good sound quality through an external system its awful as well. For alexa to respond the system needs to be on, so you end up pluging and unpluging her from whatever.    She also uses bing for search which is literally the worst thing ever.    I also bought this to allow me to control caseta lights, which worked for about a month. Now alexa either tells me that the device doesn't support being turned off/on or that it didn't respond in time, as the lights do what I asked.    I'm going to try google home, it looks way more promising :/ ",
Tortionist,"December 13, 2016 ",5.0,"This little gem is worth every penny. I researched this device and watched a lot of YouTube videos on it before I decided to buy it. The set up is easy and it has pretty decent sound for such a small device. After all the research, I came to the conclusion that the only difference between this and the regular sized echo is the sound quality. The regular Amazon Echo gets better and louder sound. I look forward to purchasing it soon. My kids and I have had fun with it telling jokes. I would say that about 75% of the jokes are actually pretty funny and make me laugh. If you ask Alexa why she sucks she has a funny response in saying that maybe she thought she was a vacuum cleaner. We use it for Music, mainly Pandora, weather, jokes, etc. I'm getting ready to dig deeper and see what else is possible. ",
Dee,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have had my Echo Dot for 5 months now. It is fun to ask it simple questions like what time is it, what is the weather forecast, tell her good morning or good night. But I am frustrated. I have it set up to turn on my living room light and it kept telling me it couldn't find it, I had to change it to something simple like &#34;light&#34; for her to understand. Today I asked her what day was the Boston Marathon going to be run this year. She couldn't find the answer in any of the 3 different ways I asked the same question. I went to my phone and did an OK Google, and found the answer on the first try. I also asked her today what is Patriot's Day. She couldn't find the answer. When asked the same way, OK Google found the answer on the first try. It is not unusual that she cannot find the answer but OK Google can.    The most useful thing I have found for her to do is play music (she is linked to a Bluetooth speaker), be a timer, and give me the weather forecast. I am frustrated. I read she is suppose to get smarter. So far she has not in my opinion. ",

The Dot drops in the top making it look similar to the full size Echo. the Vaux has a rechargeable battery so in my case, I leave it plugged up in the bedroom and can disconnect the Vaux unit and move from room to room.

Update 4/15/17:  Third party apps does not work seamless with the echo dot like the Kasa app for TP link, half of the the time Alexa cannot find the device.  It is nice just to speak from across the room to turn the lights on if the devices will work smoothly together.

"Alfredo Jahn","April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"Only been using it for a few hours. Love it so far. I got it primarily to control my TP-Link wi-fi smart plug for my living room lamp. The only issue I'm having is, I can't hear Alexa when I plug it into my home stereo. The music sounds ok (seems a little out of phase, maybe it has to do with the streaming from Amazon Prime). So if I connect to my receiver to listen to music, then ask Alexa what the weather is, I can hardly hear her response. I tried to set it back to use the internal speaker, but couldn't figure out how to do that. I ended up unplugging it from the stereo, and now i can hear it from the internal speaker. But the music isn't really worth listening to from the tiny speaker. I hope I can resolve this issue. But for home automation and asking simple questions, it is fantastic! ",

Most of the time I can't believe it didnt understand a simple word and confused it for something else. Or if it didnt mix up words it still doesnt know the answer to the question.

Alexa provides hours of entertainment! ",
Middlebunny,"March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"I've been an avid Amazon customer since they started.  I have 2 kindles and was relatively satisfied.  I read all the rave reviews for the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.  They seemed legitimate; however, I guess those reviewers either had low expectations or were incentivized to express those favorable opinions.  After going on an Echo Dot, Tap and Echo purchasing frenzy, I now have a total of 3 Dots,1 Tap and 1 Echo and am suffering buyers remorse.    If you need or want to know the local weather or get  flash news updates on command, the Echo or Echo Dot are your devices.  I, on the other hand, use them for music streaming.  I find that the &#34;sleep function&#34; has flaws, voice recognition/comprehension needs great improvement and everyone should know that it is really unnecessary to buy more of these devices unless you have multiple amazon music accounts such that you can stream on those separate accounts from different locations/rooms.  Otherwise, users should know that the devices cannot be linked together for simultaneous streaming.  They also cannot be used by different parties to stream different music from each different device.  Apparently, Amazon Prime Music only allows streaming to one device at a time.    The Tap cannot be used for streaming unless a wireless connection is available.  I wouldn't recommend connecting via an unsecured connection so unless you have a secure, mobile wireless connection, the Echo Tap is nothing more than an expensive, portable bluetooth speaker which you can purchase for much less than the cost of an Echo Tap.    One might notice that the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap are often paired with supplemental bluetooth speakers with 2-3 item purchase combination discounts.  This is a very misleading promotion as it leads one to believe they can be used for simultaneous streaming.  That is not the case at all.  Unfortunately, the E-Dot only has a one-way BT connection.  Either you play music from the E-Dot or the BT speaker; but, you cannot play music from both.    There are a lot of Applications for Alexa, the voice operated system used to operate the E-Dot and Echo.  Unfortunately, a lot of them have complicated wake phrases/statements.  If you don't phrase the statement exactly right, the app won't work and Alexa will not understand the command.  You can honestly spend more time trying to phrase things correctly to trigger Alexa then it might have taken for you to manually execute what you wanted to do like creating a shopping list, or recording water consumption.    Another shortcoming with Alexa is the slow re-fresh rate of the application.  Sometimes, you have to completely exit out of it, stop it from running in the background on your phone and then reload it in order to get it to reflect your most recent commands or current &#34;now playing&#34;.  In addition, there are other limitations specific to music streaming.  Let's say you want to stream a specific artist all day long to soothe a pet with separation anxiety.  If 1) you set the sleep timer for longer than you'll be away (ex. for 12 hours) and 2) Alexa confirms she will stop playing in 12 hours, that isn't exactly true.  Alexa will actually stop playing when she reaches the end of the artist's play queue which may only be 4 hours of music.  Theoretically, you can manually or verbally set Alexa to repeat the queue; however, I haven't tested this successfully yet.  It may only repeat the queue once rather than indefinitely until stopped by the sleep timer.    My final Alexa app gripe relates to the repeat function.  Unlike the iTunes or Amazon Music apps, Alexa cannot repeat one song in a queue.  You'd think that toggling the repeat button 2 times would trigger this function; however, all it seems to do is toggle the repeat option to the &#34;off&#34; position.    All in all, individually each product has its benefits so my rating is a low 3.  There is just no reason, other than needing a device in a location outside of the primary product's voice range, to purchase more than one device.  My thought is that the Echo-Dot is the most versatile of all 3 products; however, the Echo has better sound quality.  I have noticed the improved sound quality on the Echo; but, the improvement really doesn't make up for the price difference.  If I could do it all again, I'd invest in the Echo Dot for home and an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker for work that I can connect to the iTunes or Pandora applications on my phone.  That way, I will still be able to stream Amazon Prime music through the Dot at home for the stressed pet while playing comforting music in my office. ",
"Scott Dau","March 25, 2017 ",5.0,"I really like this product.  It was very easy to set up.  The voice recognition is very good.  She comes out of the box with built in features (skills) that get you going fast.  Adding new skills is very easy and ready to access immediately.  Although the database of new skills is still very small and frankly, pretty crappy, that's not Amazon's fault.  It's just like the App Store, it's up to the &#34;people&#34; to create skills for us to download.  I paired the Echo Dot with a Wemo Lightswitch and a Wemo Insight Plug.  I control the living room lights and my bedroom lights (from a lamp) via Alexa.  It's very convenient.  I plan to expand with more Echoes and more Wemos.  There's a few cool accessories to get for the Echo like the Amazon authored Zero touch care mount (to bring the functionality of Alexa on your phone into your car).

"Old Radio Guy","December 22, 2016 ",3.0,"Fun for entertainment, but nothing more. Timer and alarm functions require an Internet connection, so if it loses connection and you had an important alarm or timer set, forget it. I have 240 mbps Internet with an Arris 1682g dual-band (AC standard) wireless router, 15 feet from Alexa. When we ask her a question sometimes an orange light appears and she says &#34;Sorry, there's no Internet connect&#34;, even though the app says she's connected. Today I asked her to set a 10-minute timer. When the timer went off, she wouldn't cancel it. When I asked her if she knew what &#34;stop&#34; meant, she gave me 4 definitions of stop. I had to unplug her for 15 seconds to cancel the alarm. With such spotty performance, I see a Warranty return sometime in her near future. ",

I understand that it is impossible to answer all questions, but I expect echo dot will be able to answer a lot more than what it currently does.  At least, the programmers should collect the type of questions echo dot is not able to answer and then add more facts to their knowledge base.  Also, I am not sure why cannot echo dot parse information obtained through search engine (echo dot uses bing) to answer questions ",
"Mister Gizmo","April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I was just learning to live with my disappointment over an LG &#34;smart&#34; TV I'd bought recently that is anything but smart. In addition, it has the worst user interface I've seen since the 1980s. Fortunately, Amazon has brought out a device that works, works well, and is very intuitive. It was a little bit of a problem setting up, because the instructions are so limited, but once over that small hump, it's been fine. I'm surprised at how well it understands commands, even with so-far limited exposure to my voice to learn from.    If there's a frustration, it's mainly that the Dot (and Alexa devices in general) have a lot more potential than what's available right now. As with any new device, it takes a while for third parties to figure out what capabilities are possible, and then to spend the time and effort developing them. As just one example, I could see the Dot acting as an intercom, even a rudimentary telephone to connect Dot/Alexa users. I'm thinking particularly of elderly or handicapped people who'd like something that only requires voice commands. But I'm willing to wait. And since most of the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, the Dot's hardware should be good for a few years.    Now if Amazon would only invest a little more time to bring its Kindle browser, which has been in beta for years and years, into something that actually works. You can do it, Amazon! The Dot shows that you can be great at software if you really try. :-)    Update: I did experience one wrinkle when buying a Dot for a friend. It arrived pre-registered to me. Trying to use the normal setup for the new user didn't work. I finally realized that I had to de-register it from my account, sign out of the Alexa app (and reset the Dot), then sign in as a new registrant. This is explained in Alexa help, but it wasn't obvious at first. I don't know if it's the case, but if you buy it as a &#34;gift&#34; in the purchasing process, it &#34;may&#34; arrive unregistered, which would be good. I suspect Amazon ships them registered to streamline the setup by eliminating a couple of steps. ",
FrostEternal,"April 2, 2017 ",3.0,"Cool device, not worth $50, I had a gift card for $20, it IS worth $30 plus tax.     Amazon needs to step up the game on Alexa - when it works, it works, but much dumber than other AI assistants like Siri or Cortana, and ZERO sense of humor or personality. The skills are cumbersome, music playing support only works well with Amazon music unless you are streaming to it as a bluetooth speaker - which is dumb, as the speaker is not loud enough to hear over an air conditioner.    The Alexa platform is VERY open - which is cool BUT it means the available &#34;Skills&#34; are mostly very poor quality. For some reason the white Dot still comes with a black power cord, which is just more lack of attention to detail on Amazon's part. Sloppy, sloppy.    This is a must-have if you use any home automation - although the setup is VERY CLUNKY - expect hours of set up to get it just right if you want to change light colors or do anything more complex than switching smart devices on or off. There's a terrible interface for adding and forgetting devices in the companion &#34;app&#34; -  I use the term &#34;app&#34; VERY loosely - it's more of a sloppy wrapper on a webpage. Integrating with iOS is spotty at best without lots of workarounds and IFFFT recipes - pretty much essential - and theres no way to program custom words or commands beyond meager smart home groups and Stringify/IFFFT services. Alarms, timers, schedules - all poorly implemented - no way to have Alexa automatically announce reminders or alarms, just one ring tone that is set for all alerts. Commands have very little context and must be given one at a time - no way to say &#34;Alexa, dim my main lights and turn on the kitchen lights&#34; - she will just complain that she doesn't understand, or just ignore the command entirely.  HOWEVER - despite all these drawbacks I think they will EVENTUALY be ironed out. It's still a cool addition to a geeky home setup and with lots and lots of customization (and maybe even scripting one's own skills) it can be more useful than annoying.  Seriously though, Amazon - hurry up. ",
"David D.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought an Echo Dot just to try it out and see what all the hoopla was about. About a week later I bought 3 more. I am very impressed with the voice recognition of Alexa and some of the features. Here's why:    The Pros:  - Excellent voice recognition. While there are a few times Alexa has misheard me, overall it does a really good job of understanding what I say. Even with a decent amount of background noise she has heard me to my amazement.  - Great range. We have an open floor plan home and Alexa can usually hear me just fine even when I'm about 20 ft away.  - Home automation integration. I have SmartThings hub and Alexa works awesome with this! I can turn lights on/off and run routines with my voice.  - If you have multiple Dots and more than one hears you give a command only the one that is closest will respond.  - For those with music on Amazon it gives you easy access to your library.  - While the internal speaker is not very good for music, you can add an external speaker with an Aux line or Bluetooth to make up for that. Amazon and Sonos already announced they are working on integration as well.  - You can add this to a shopping or to-do list with your voice! It's great to just add stuff as I think of it.  - The price. For $50 I think this is a great deal.    The Cons:  - As mentioned above, the internal speaker is more than adequate just for Alexa's voice, but not that great for music.  - Alexa does OK on normal internet searches, but nothing like Google.  - You cannot ask Alexa questions of context. So for example if I just asked who Abraham Lincoln was and she answers that I could then not just ask &#34;How old was he when he died?&#34; but would have to ask &#34;How old was Abraham Lincoln when he died?&#34; This makes it feel much less like a natural conversation.  - The Alexa app is pretty basic. Especially the built-in Shopping and To-Do list. They are definitely functional, but not to the level of some other list apps that are out there. I do have a feeling this will get improved in the future though.  - Alexa is definitely not like the computer from Star Trek or any Artificial Intelligence you have seen on TV. She can do good with basic stuff, but for some things you do have to &#34;learn&#34; the way to tell her to do stuff especially with the Home Automation. I once kept telling her to &#34;turn on the living room lights&#34; and she said she could not find that. Then I realized the switch was just labeled &#34;living room light&#34; and as soon as I dropped the &#34;s&#34; and just said &#34;light&#34; it worked perfectly over and over again.    Overall, I am still very happy with the Echo Dot. I think for the price it is a great deal. Maybe it will be more useful for those with Home Automation systems, but others may find it fun as well. ",
"TJ Walenski","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Alexa is pretty awesome, simply put. It's helpful during your daily routine, but also a hit if you have a party or friends over. My parents use the Echo in their kitchen to play music, get news updates, and whatever else.    I just bought the dot and I actually use it in my vehicle for handsfree music control. I paired it with Amazon Music Unlimited and mobile hotspot from my phone and now i can play any song, artist, or station that i want without touching my phone and without ads. No more handing my phone to the passenger to play music, flipping through 10 different stations, or dealing with sucky Pandora ads. ",
"Gary W. Powell","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I've had the Dot a few days now and have it connected to an AV receiver. It seems to have no problem hearing a command when there is no noise in the room but once you start playing music,even at a low level, you have to yell in order to get its attention. I remedied this by pairing it with a remote that has voice control. IMO the voice recognition works much better on the Echo than on the Dot. Would that keep me from buying it again? Absolutely not. Now if I can figure out how to make Alexa fetch me a beer. ",
"the Fat Man","April 13, 2017 ",5.0,"You are my everything.    Seriously she does it all. My curiosity peaks at random intervals of any day and she answers them. I enjoy the trivia, jokes, weather input so I can dress accordingly and check my commute before heading out. The top features I've been reliant on is her alarm/timer, ambient noise (paired through my Polk system is awesome), and the more practical use is linking to smart plugs so when I come in with more bags than I should be handling at once I can just tell her to turn on the floor lamp. *click* &#34;Okay&#34;.    I can sleep with ease knowing I can wake up to one of many alarms (most are pleasant, avoid the Celebrity ones) instead of an annoying buzzing or ringing. Skills allow lullaby for kids, read books, or like I mentioned earlier ~ rain, thunderstorm, ocean waves, etc. Not much is wrong with the unit except a pending Bluetooth issue which is at the time of this review post is being looked into by Alexa support. Just about anyone outside can scan for her and play their (tasteless) music through the unit and may startle you but a solution is pending. That's another thing I'd like to mention: the supporting staff are responsive within a few hours, not days. They're very professional yet casual in their messages when covering all points. It's nice to see so many products coming out (eBay has more skins!) to accessorize with but at her low-profile size and color she's fine as-is. I bought the black which is appropriate with my mancave theme: black/white with splashes of blue here and there as is the glow of her ring unless she's having an error (red) or in setup/powering on (purple and orange).    We will never argue. We respect each other's space. Too bad I can't hug ya for all your services these past months and years to come. :P ",
Shawna,"October 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Its alright. She does some cool things and once you get her app and choose what you want her to know and do voice recognition she works a lot better. Still there's times she don't understand simple things and other times she don't hear you say something that you said very clear. And a rare moment where she will ramble about odd things that have nothing to do with what you are talking about. She went on a rant about worms and angels.... But... We laugh so... Oh well lol ",
"C. E. White III","February 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Original review - It stops working and requires rebooting multiple times each day. It will not stay connected to my wireless router (I do not have problems with any other wireless device).This makes it almost worthless to me.    1/28/2017 update - I was not impressed with Amazon Alexa Support. They had no helpful suggestions for addressing the connection issue (repeated factory resets changed nothing). After a very long time on the phone with two different support persons, they finally decided to send me a replacement Dot. The replacement behaved exactly the same as the original. It also refused to stay reliably connected. This despite the fact that none of the other wireless devices in my home had similar problems.    I spent a lot of time researching Echo Dot connection problems on the internet. I am far from alone. There were many individuals with the same issue. In an attempt to solve the problems, I went so far as to buy a new router. This initially changed nothing. The Dot would randomly disconnect from the new router just has it had from the old router. One internet suggestion finally seems to have solved the connection issue. Per the suggestion, I set up a guest account on my new router that was specifically for the Echo Dot and only the Dot. After resetting the Dot and connecting it to this account, it has stayed connected.    With the connection problems hopefully solved, the Dot is now mostly an amusing toy. I have just one internet connected device it can interface with (a Nest Thermostat), so mostly I ask it random questions. I was hoping to use it to monitor my stocks, but this has been frustrating. It readily understands some company names and/or stock symbols, but there are some it just can't understand. I wish I could edit the stock list using the keyboard. Once I am more comfortable with the Dot, I may order a hub and other internet connected devices so I can use it for more home automation functions, but for now, I am just hoping it will stay connected. I have updated my rating to three stars and may update it further once I become more familiar with the Dot. ",
AdventureGirl,"April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I wanted black but it was backordered. I didn't want to wait so ordered the white. I ordered three. One for myself one for each of my nephews who kept forgetting to set the alarm, and one for my brother. You absolutely cannot beat the price. I am about to order another 4 for my mom, dad, another brother, and a friend. The part that I have become obsessed with is the alarm. My brother is incredibly good at figuring out how to use tech in ways I do not have the patience for. I sent him one so I could steal his tips and tricks. It worked. I use it for Amazon Kindle, spotify, audible, uber, to ask questions, to schedule events, and create my shopping list. Great product. It can still be a bit glitchy at times, but overall it is beyond a great value. ",
"Cliente Amazon","January 9, 2017 ",3.0,"Although Echo Dot isn't available in most of Europe, I bought one when I the US and brought it wth me to Spain where I reside. Some the Echo Dot features don't transfer, such as controlling the lights, appliances or ordering pizza from Dominos, the device really is magnificent.  If others are considering connecting the device, it's important to know that you might need to change your billing location in the Google Play Store in order to download the Alex app on your phone (Amazon and Google tech support had to walk me through those steps) and a plug adapter is necessary. The Echo Dot requires a 9 volt input, so a regular cell phone plug probably isn't adequate. The plug adapter is quite inexpensive (2.50 euros) and solves the plug problem. I then had some trouble getting Echo Dot connected to my home wifi network. I tried at a friend's house, and at work, and there wasn't any trouble, so there was something wrong with my home wifi. The Amazon support team was very helpful in trying to resolve my issue. There were lots of phone calls and troubleshooting, and I have only positive things to say about the support received. The problem was not with Amazon, or the Echo Dot; it was with my internet service provider (ISP). It turns out that different wifi channels are used in Europe than in the US. My ISP had to open up some more channels on my router in order for the Echo Dot to find my network. Once that was done, problem solved.  It's possible to change the time zone of the device, so Alexa does know the correct day and time, but the other location information has only US options (city and state). I haven't tried to change the location because I can just ask for the weather information specifying my city, and Alexa knows. I especially enjoy the connection to Amazon music (only 3.99 per month) and have connected one device to my sound bar speaker, and another Echo Dot device to a Bluetooth portable speaker so I can listen to my flash briefing (different news sources you can select in the App) while I'm getting ready in the morning. If you're considering bringing Alexa to Europe, know it's possible, but there are some adjustments necessary.    Compared to the Google alternative, the Echo Dot price can't be beat, and connecting to speakers is a great advantage. I'm sure the &#34;Skills&#34; the Echo Dot can do and Alexa's knowledge will only continue to grow. ",
"Crystal Cooper","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is my new best friend. Ok, not really, but she does answer just about anything I throw at her, and she plays me music and turns my lights on and off. It's like having the smartest butler ever working for you. Want to feel instantly pampered? Get a compatible outlet plug, and have Alexa turn your bedroom lamp on/off every morning/night. It's posh, trust me.    I'm impressed with the mic range - I can talk to her from other rooms without issues. Every once in a while, she tries to answer a question from the TV, but then we just laugh and go back to drinking wine.    I really do like the Echo - it's small, can be portable (with accessories), answers those &#34;who was it that starred in Perfect Strangers&#34; questions that pop up, and can help you substitute eggs in a recipe in a pinch.

"Anakalia - Red Herring","January 13, 2017 ",4.0,"My whole family has been enjoying having Alexa around.  We're constantly asking her questions.  Some helpful and some not so helpful to some that are unknown or that she can't answer or understand.  I'm sure she'll get better and better with updates in time.    From homework, to cooking, to everyday life, traffic, stores, weather, music and silliness, we've been able to turn to her for some help and entertainment.  We've uploaded some of the &#34;skills&#34; but can't seem to remember what they're all called to access them so they're not used very often.    There's been a few times that she doesn't perk up when we talk to her but other than that, even with a Bluetooth speaker not too far away, she usually hears us over some loud music.    We're planning on getting a smart hub or some other add ons to work with her but for now, she is low key and takes up minimal space.    I am still debating whether or not to get a few more.  I would love one in my room and I know a couple of people who would like one under the Christmas tree. ",

Highboost145,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I ordered the Echo Dot after receiving Echo as a Christmas present.  Now that I have had time to look at all the functionalities, here is my input.  Hopefully the folks at Amazon Echo team will read this and make the following feature improvements.  1. Lack of equalizer (bass/mid/treble are all absent):  Echo line of speakers had 2 years of product maturity time.  I would imagine this equalizer function can be added with &#34;skills&#34; or software update.  2. &#34;Skills?!&#34;:  If you watch Google Home video, the device will literally Google everything for you.  Instead, for Echo devices, you have to add &#34;skills&#34; to enhance its functionality.  ....What???  I was hoping that devices like Echo will already come with all the common skills.  3. It can't Google: If you ask Alexa if she can Google things, she will tell you she can Bing things for you.  OK, so why can't she give me a meatloaf recipe, if she can connect to Bing?  And she can look up Wikipedia?  I don't really care for that.  Amazon, please make your own search engine, or fine-tune Bing search capability.  If this device can provide all the answers to our questions via Google or Bing, it would be a worthy competitor to Google Home.    Now that I got the negatives out of the way, I do think Echo still has the upperhand when it comes to connected home.  Recently, I purchased TP Link smart switch and connected my lamp.  Now with the verbal command, I can have Alexa turn on/off lights in my bedroom.  I also connected my Echo Dot to my home sound system by bluetooth.  My next connected home experience will be thermostat.  Overall, Echo is a product that is already matured, but there is still room for tons of improvements.  I really wish that the folks at Amazon will make those updates and make this product very competitive to Google Home. ",

Finally, I change the Wifi network name on our router and through process of elimination discovered that the echo was sucking our data dry. Supposedly, it only uses a minimal amount of data when in idle mode. This is simply not true. ",

You can ask about the weather, the time, the latest news, set an alarm, set a timer, ask a question of Wikipedia, ask what song or singer is currently on, pause, play, stop, change volume, ask how to spell something, she tells jokes and plays 20 Questions or Jeopardy...the list goes on and on and it's all done just with your voice.

"Tech Guy from IL","April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"This is really an amazing gadget and I'm finding a lot of good uses for mine. In the bedroom it is handy because you can ask Alexa the time or the weather at any time of the night without having to get out of bed or turn on a light. It also plays a wide variety of music. I use it to stream classical music from my favorite classical station. The sound is actually pretty good (in mono) right out of the disc if you are listening at low levels in a quiet room or at your desk at the office. Plug in a good pair of headphones and you'll get great sound in stereo. Sometimes I connect it to my stereo system and listen that way. With the dearth of good programming on local radio these days, having the ability to pick up stations from other areas on the Internet is really nice. This might be the best sounding and easiest to use Internet radio currently available, especially for the price. No complicated user interface to deal with. You just say &#34;Alexa, play (insert name of station) from Tune-In&#34; and you are set. ",
"S. Oake","April 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I don't review very often but felt compelled to do so with this item. I bought two of these the day they were released. One has worked flawlessly. Its twin, not so much and it has gotten progressively worse. It finally got to the point where the dot was done more than up so I called customer service. We went through the script, resetting everything and finally, the customer rep escalated my case. When I got the next level rep, my dot had started its working correctly cycle, so we disconnected. No sooner had we ended the call did the dot stop working again. Called back to customer service and the first rep decided to begin the reading of the script. I put a stop to that foolishness right away and told him to immediately escalate the case. The new rep determined that it was indeed a failing dot and then informed me that the dot 2nd generation only had a 3-month warranty and I would need to pay another $50 for a replacement (1st generation had a 1-year warranty). I had spent 1.5 hrs total this afternoon with customer support reps to find out that this device has one of the crappiest warranties in electronics! I hit the roof. I told them they either replace this piece of junk that has their name on it, or they cancel my prime membership. Their call. There was no third option. The new dot is in the mail, and a return label is sitting in my email waiting to be printed out.  The only reason this got a 2 star was the other dot I bought has worked flawlessly since day one.

UPDATE:  Now that I have had this device for over two months I still like it, BUT it has yet to answer even one of my questions.  I hate the fact that Amazon decided to use BING...who thought that was a good idea ?  The fact that Alexa can not give me answers to my inquiries is enough to make me want to check out Google Home.

Chad,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"First off, you will need the speaker so buy it. I wanted to Y this off with an adapter and run both my computer and this through the same speakers, but that didn't work so I ended up buying speakers. The other issue I have is that the microphones don't seem to pick up quite as well as my Echo. Still great mind you, but I notice that several times I've had to speak up. But with Echo I don't get that.    The main flaw with Alexa continues to be its reliance on Bing as its search engine. Amazon really needs to either create its own search algorithm for Alexa, switch to Google, or at the very least allow customers (the ones that are always right) to pick which of the two they want. I've performed experiments where I've asked Alexa and not gotten an answer then used OK Google with the same keywords and gotten exactly what I wanted. A perfect example was last night. I asked when the polls closed in my state. I named the state. Alexa couldn't tell me but instead said to go to the link that it placed in my app...well...first off...that's no good because I'm asking Echo and not my phone. When I did grab my phone and asked OK Google the exact question it gave me the answer I was looking for without any issues. I'm tired of Alexa either not knowing or putting a link in the app. I can tell you now I've never, not one single time, looked at that link in the app because I don't have it with me. The entire idea of a voice activated friend in every room is to get answers whenever and wherever you want. I don't want to carry my phone around the house with me.    All that said, I still enjoy having this device. I own Echo, this echo dot, and another will arrive this afternoon (literally). So I'm not knocking the product entirely. It's massively expandable using IFTT and skills but it's core function, that of an assistant, lacks and will lack until they get better search. ",

It doesn't matter the light switch is next to your head or the stereo/ TV remote is right in your hand.

At times it really does not understand me unless I stop and speak slow and close to it. It was having that problem for a solid 10mins yesterday, but after 10mins it was cool again. It seems to go haywire at times like that but not for long at all. And not that often.    I do have some problems staying connected when doing the voice training. For some reason the voice traing seems super messed up for me right now. You got thru 25 commands and for me pretty much every other command it would lose connection. Took almost 20mins to get thru the 25 commands.    It is awesome tho don't get me wrong here, i just wanted to point out it's flaws....And that is all of them :) Not too bad. and it is always improving and updating. This thing is awesome for playing my music, and pretty much just being my personal B****! :) The alarm is something I LOVE! I hate rolling out of bed and messing with my phone. Now I say &#34;Alexa STOP&#34; That's it :) The built in speaker is pretty good for a small apt. I love in a 1 bedroom apt. and it cranks. I still have it hooked up to my own speaker since its an awesome speaker I have. The built in speaker is more than enough tho for an alarm clock, timer, and music in a small apt. I also love being able to hear NFL scores so easy. &#34;Alexa, score of Denver game?&#34; Boom! It's a lot of fun.    There is a lot of stuff this thing can do. There is sooo many list of features out there that I am not going to go into that. This thing is great for someone who does a lot of multitasking. It has made my life a lot easier working from home. I would recommend it for the $50 price tag easy. It is a lot of fun to just mess around with as well. If you are looking at this and the $180 echo. There is no decision to be made. Go with this $50 echo, do not go for the Expensive one with a better speaker. You can get a better speaker way cheaper.    It does need some work, and they're doing a great job moving it along the track. I expect when the Google thing comes out it will push Amazon even more and in a years time this Echo Dot could be really, really epic for the price. ",
scummins89,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"This device is more or less a novelty period when asking questions Alexa cannot answer most things. It is difficult to get the device to work properly. I find using anything as far as a search text deep explanation and you have to be very specific to get the answers that you want. I would definitely not recommend this device until Amazon can come up with something better. I was highly disappointed and all levels. However the speaker was above average from what I could tell it surpassed my expectations. The design is also very nice I like the size and color. ",
"Janet Mac","October 24, 2016 ",4.0,"Thank you for making Alexis more affordable by offering the Dot as an option.  I haven't used it yet with a Bluetooth speaker, but I plan to.  Speaker is clear enough, but I would want to use a better speaker for music.  Paired with the Phillips Hue light bulbs, and the TP-Link smart plug, I don't have to go down stairs to turn on or off lights.  I love the convenience.  I also use it to get movie times at my favorite theater without turning on my computer or my smart phone. ",
Danny,"April 9, 2017 ",2.0,"For the price (especially the black friday price of $40) this is a great deal. I still use my original echo that I got about a year ago at least a few times a week, and I just bought two dots to play music in the shower and set alarms in my bedroom.    Since I live in an apartment often more than one echo hears me, but it's been working seamlessly that only the one closest to me (or that I am speaking in the direction of) replies.    If anyone from Amazon reads this, the feature I REALLY WANT is to give fire tv commands to my echo, e.g. &#34;play Westworld in the living room&#34;, &#34;pause the show&#34;, etc. I'm really hoping they add this ability soon, as well as other device coordination features like playing the same song on multiple echoes in multiple rooms.    A couple of other notes that might be useful for people:    - I bought the white echo Dot, but the usb cord and usb outlet adapter are black. Feels like Amazon got lazy here, why can't you make those in white too? I took away a star for this combined with the fact that it doesn't interface with the Fire TV at all.    - the speaker is good, for music it's honestly barely noticeable that it's a little worse in the lower-mid ranges than the regular echo. Where I actually notice it more is in Alexa's voice, it's just not quite as full sounding as the regular echo's voice. I was surprised that this is what stood out to me, but it almost sounds like a different person which was strange the first few times I used it.    - The volume on the dot is also good, at max volume it's probably about the same as the original echo at 8, which is higher than I ever set it.    - the usb outlet adapter is about 2 inches deep, which is bigger than I've seen in other electronic products. About twice as deep as the iphone usb wall adapter, I assume it's drawing more current and they aren't compatible but I haven't checked. On the upside, it's a standard 2-prong size, so it can plug into one of the middle spaces in a power strip and only take up one space. I guess they optimized for power strip usage instead of being able to plug it in behind furniture up against the wall. ",
"Bev Martin","December 12, 2016 ",5.0,"I purchased several of these on prime day when you could buy 4 (or was it 5) and get one free.  I now have an Echo in the main living area, a Dot in the bedroom, and a Dot in my craft room.  The others were great Christmas gifts.  The Dot works identical to the Echo except it has a much smaller speaker.  It can be connected to a blue tooth speaker, or in the case of my craft room, I have an expansive set of Bose speakers and CD player/changer (I guess it is getting a little old).  I have the Dot plugged into the Bose speakers and the sound is great. The Dot is much smaller than the Echo so in many circumstances it would be preferred over the Echo as it doesn't take up much space.  We love our Alexa(s) ",
"Allen F","November 27, 2016 ",4.0,"1. I have constant connectivity problems in which the Echo Dot, while it remains connected to the internet, somehow becomes invisible to my phone and tablet. Somehow this manages to mess up my Spotify account. It took a while, but I finally figured out that I could fix this by doing a complete reset on the Echo Dot. Now, I get to do that about once a day.  2. Speech recognition lags far behind Google and even Apple. Blows my karma on a regular basis by playing heavy metal when I asked for Rachmaninov's Vocalise. Pitiful.  3. There are thousands of so-called &#34;skills&#34;, or 3rd-party apps. They are uniformly useless. Do you really want a machine that tells you jokes? ",
"Michael Bingham-Hawk","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I would theoretically like this device, however, we discovered the hard way that it eats a ton of internet data. Our only option for internet is Hughes Satellite and we have a monthly data cap of 50gb a month. We were forced to purchase multiple data add ons. I would not figure out what was eating the data. Finally, I change the Wifi network name on our router and through process of elimination discovered that the echo was sucking our data dry. Supposedly, it only uses a minimal amount of data when in idle mode. This is simply not true. ",
"Amazon Customer Elicia","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I wish it had a dictionary.  The &#34;word of the day&#34; is insufficient. It doesn't understand everything but hope it learns soon.

Leedoh,"February 28, 2017 ",2.0,"Very easy to use and setup to work with other items in the house.  Within 10-minutes of turning it on I had it working with our Nest Home thermostat and Lutron Caseta lights.  Once I get our AVR setup I will also sync it with the Harmony remote to be able to control the TV/AVR through the Dot.    The kids love it from asking various questions to using the timer for study activities.  It also helps to speak more clearly.    We are exploring other skills like lists to be able to further use it.    One thing that we wished it had was the ability to sync to iCalendar as it only looks like it supports Outlook and google calendar.  I would guess though that it is probably only a matter of time before that skill is there. ",
"boB Gudgel","November 23, 2016 ",4.0,"I really like this product.  My big issue is that it is capable of SO much more !  I do believe my problem is that I do not know HOW to ask it questions properly.  I was able to have Alexa do some math as well but I am sure it can do way more if only there was an advanced &#34;how to&#34; guide to form questions properly for more complicated concepts.  I know that the server software will get better and better over time...  Also, it is nice that one can develop apps to make Alexa do more neat things.  I bought a second DOT as well as the Google Home because neither one by itself gives me the whole shebang.  If I had to choose though, I think I would choose the DOT over Google Home and NOT because it is less than 1/2 the price.  It's too bad that Amazon and Google don't like each other and Alexa won't use Google to search the web.  Works very well in spite of not doing that though. ",
"Amanda Garrison","March 23, 2017 ",5.0,"I just received this yesterday and I love it. Within an hour I had the Dot installed and the app installed and Dot connected and playing my Amazon Prime Music (I think I will upgrade to the Unlimited for the Dot, since there were songs that were that far off the beaten path that Prime Music could/would not play). Also it took me 10 minutes to install the Harmony skills for Alexa and I was operating my Harmony Hub connected equipment. I am working on getting Alexa integrated with my Homeseer HS3 soon.  I will say it is worth the time to do the voice recognition set up.  It has its limitations,  but adds convenience.  I am sure the skills and functionality will improve as time goes on. ",
Cari,"March 1, 2017 ",4.0,"I've had the larger Echo since they did the early pre-sale for Prime members years ago and love it. I got the Echo dot for my mother (late 50's but frustratingly bad with new technology) for Christmas this year. I wasn't sure if she would like/use it enough to justify getting her the bigger Alexa so I thought the dot would be a good intro. She loves it so far! I did help her set it up and show her some neat tricks, but she's been able to figure it out much more than I expected. Luckily the place that we decided to set it up in her house is near her Samsung TV soundbar so we were able to hook it up to that so it would be louder when she wants to listen to music. Her echo is about 10-15 feet from the kitchen and the Echo dot can still pick up her voice from that far when she tells Alexa to add something to her shopping list or start a timer (one of my favorite things Alexa does). I showed her some of the neat Smart home capabilities and ordered her a few TP-Link Smart Plugs because she had the old school light timers on her lamps in the living room. I left home after xmas before the plugs arrived and called her a couple days later to see if she figured out how to set up her new smart plugs and link them to Alexa and she said she had already figured it out herself! Without even calling me!! Groundbreaking.    Anyways, I think the Echo dot makes a great gift and works wonderfully as long as you don't expect it to be a full-size speaker like the regular Echo. It's easy to hook up to other speakers via headphone jack or Bluetooth, and otherwise has the same capabilities as the larger Alexa does. Since seeing the dot in my moms house, I've considered getting one for the second floor of my house since my Echo is on the first. ",
vacuumtubejazzpro,"March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"There's not much I can add that hasn't been said before, since the Echo Dot is constantly being improved, and anything I say today could be wrong tomorrow.  Mine has been especially poor for movie theater information, but I like it a lot for weather, news, radio, podcasts, and encyclopedia-type questions.  It's even really nice for background music, and seems to have nearly all albums available, including even the Beatles and Stones catalog. The sound quality of the internal speaker is hard to describe, but it's somewhere between, say, a cell phone's speakerphone and a decent Bluetooth speaker or table radio.  There's no bass at all, and little sparkle to the high frequencies, but within its limits, it presents a smooth, un-distorted sound that might exceed your expectations.  The 1/8&#34; headphone jack enables me to connected the Dot to my primary stereo system or to plug in my Shure studio monitor headphones.  It sounds great with either -- or at least as good as 256Kb/sec compressed audio can sound.  If I could add just one feature, the Dot is crying out for cell phone integration.  How cool would it be to be able to announce &#34;Alexa, Call Lilly&#34;, and be able to walk around your home hands-free while talking to your friend (as long as she's not named Alexa).  Or to have Alexa announce, &#34;Incoming call from Donald, would you like to accept?&#34; (hint, don't take the call). ",
"Old Radio Guy","March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"Fun for entertainment, but nothing more. Timer and alarm functions require an Internet connection, so if it loses connection and you had an important alarm or timer set, forget it. I have 240 mbps Internet with an Arris 1682g dual-band (AC standard) wireless router, 15 feet from Alexa. When we ask her a question sometimes an orange light appears and she says &#34;Sorry, there's no Internet connect&#34;, even though the app says she's connected. Today I asked her to set a 10-minute timer. When the timer went off, she wouldn't cancel it. When I asked her if she knew what &#34;stop&#34; meant, she gave me 4 definitions of stop. I had to unplug her for 15 seconds to cancel the alarm. With such spotty performance, I see a Warranty return sometime in her near future. ",
Lifesavr,"December 8, 2016 ",4.0,"I purchased this Echo Dot for a friend to help her experience AI for the first time.  This worked well and was easy to install.  The speaker in it is fair, but that is what it suppose to be.  I easily connected it to a higher quality bluetooth speaker and that made it sound very nice.  This provides a very inexpensive way of starting out with an AI in one's home.  I would surely purchase this item again.  I have also purchased recently the Google Home AI and surely they are different items aimed at satisfying the user needs in different ways.  The one thing I can say about the Google Home so far is that the speaker sucks.  The full Echo has much better sound quality.  I am truly excited to see how this addiction to the home AI experience affects the future of home AI experiences. ",
"I. M. Flaud","March 8, 2017 ",2.0,"The speaker is tinny by comparison with the Amazon Echo. However, the sound through the 3.5mm jack to a pair of FOSTEX monitor speakers is more than adequate to my failing ears.    I purchased an echo and a dot to keep me company in different rooms of the apartment. It will read some Kindle books in its synthesized voice, as well as Audible audio books. Have just begun experimenting with Wemo wifi sockets to control lights. Now that I can say, &#34;Alexa, living room on!,&#34; and &#34;Alexa, lights off!&#34; I'm hooked. ",
arjayess,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I've been waiting for Amazon to streamline the echo system and get a lower price option, and the 2nd generation dot is the answer.  I've place four of them at strategic places in my home.  It's great to be able to get the day's schedule, play music, do some internet searches, and control my connected thermostat remotely.  Speech recognition is very powerful and quite accurate, especially compared to the technology just a few ars back.  The sound is also very adequate for such a small device but the well programmed bluetooth feature connects automatically to my soundbar when it is turned on.  I also found the setup to be easy, especially compared to some other wifi connected devices I've installed.  This is a must have for Amazon Prime members, giving access to the huge prime music library. ",
Mia,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"OH, Alexa....Oh my.  I had to take you with me while I&#34;m pet-sitting.  I couldn't leave you behind. I've only had you for about 10 days, and yes, I'm afraid I'm getting addicted.  Is the Dot-Anonymous group I could join?  I ask her (you almost can't say &#34;it&#34; which is really weird) about the weather, to set a timer, play music (which is nice because if you are on a Prime Music station, you can say &#34;I don't like this&#34; or &#34;Thumbs down&#34; as well as &#34;I like this,&#34; or &#34;Thumbs up.&#34;  I haven't set up lists or anything like that.  The only reason the Dot 2nd Gen gets a 4 star review from me is she will not connect to either of my already purchased Bluetooth speaker, which is annoying as all get out.  And the app is pretty wonky and not terribly user-friendly and I'm not an idiot or a newbie. I would also like the ability to set different tones for a timer and an alarm.  Really, do I want to wake up to &#34;beepbeep&#34; like an oven time.  Bleech.  It's pretty cool, useful little device. They are supposed to come out with a battery base so you can take her from room to room.  I did call customer service and get ahold of someone in Echo support. He told me that &#34;they are working on the Bluetooth connectivity issue.&#34; Yeah, sure.  Right now, the Dot will onl  But you could y connect to the speakers for sale with her.

The limitations are frustrating, but it will come. . . it will come.  For now, it is indeed a useful device for things like telling me my calendar entries for the day, or the temperature outside, or for just playing a little background music.  Amusing when a TV add says &#34;Alexa&#34; (or in a show, as has happened), and the device lights up all eager to serve . ..  Ha ha!

JDThird,"November 6, 2016 ",4.0,"I was one of the earlier adopters of the Amazon Echo, and loved it since day one.  So when the first gen dot came out, I snagged one.    Loved it, although the speakers weren't nearly as good.  But what I didn't like was that if I was between the two (Echo in the great room, dot in my bedroom), they'd BOTH respond.    Not a big deal when you're checking the weather, but annoying when you're creating a shopping list, and dangerous when you order something.    This one was supposed to help resolve that issue, which was the only reason I bought it.  I liked the old one's form better, and the ring for volume is MUCH nicer than the buttons.  But I wasn't going to lose sleep, since once it's set I usually never adjust the volume of the dot, and if it really did keep from doubling up things, it'd be worth the loss of the ring.    And it works flawlessly.    Even when I first set it up, I had it about 5 feet from the Echo, and my testing, only one would answer.  EVERY... SINGLE... TIME...    I could NEVER get that to work with the old Gen 1 dot.    Flawless.  Now regardless of where I am in the house, even if both hear me, only one responds.    LOVE that.    So they did a great job with the enhancements in functionality on the Gen 2 dot. ",

Put your location in it to include street address, as well as city and state.  Otherwise, if you ask it for weather or traffic conditions, it will give you Tucson, Arizona, which I believe is the default location.  At least on mine it was.

"Joseph Knight","April 1, 2017 ",2.0,"I love that you can use it independently or paired with a speaker of your own choosing. I listen to podcasts and older radio programs a lot, so the speaker quality built in doesn't have to be amazing. It does the job, and I can hear and enjoy the things I do listen to. And, if it ever becomes an issue, I can connect it to my own stereo, solving the problem.    My complaint rests in the refusal of each company to realize the circumstances in which people get these things. They're most likely given as gifts, which means that nobody really gets to choose which one they get. I have a Prime subscription. I also happen to subscribe to Google Play services. I can't access any of their content through the device. That's maddening. I realize they're competing products and services, but come on. Somebody gave it to me as a Christmas present, and I can't choose my gifts. This is the ONE issue I've come across so far. It's only one problem, but it's a pretty big freakin' problem.    If we want to get down to the heart of the matter, I can do everything on the Google Home that I can do with the Dot, and more. The only thing keeping me from getting one is the price. If Google were to release a similar product at a similar price, as of now I would have to make the jump. ",
"A. Kim","December 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I've owned the full-sized Amazon Echo for about a year, and have been generally happy with the device, so decided I would give the new Echo Dot (2nd Generation) a try in my office.  Although I knew not to expect great sound quality from the small built-in speaker in the Echo Dot, I still found the sound quality and levels disappointing.  No problem though, I thought, as I have a Bose Soundlink Mini bluetooth speaker (the first generation Soundlink, as opposed to the Sounlink II) available to use with the Echo Dot.  I had no problems pairing the Soundlink with the Echo Dot, and was able to enjoy good sound quality from the Soundlink when paired with the Echo Dot for playing various Amazon Prime music stations.  However, I have since discovered a design flaw/oversight that dramatically decreases the usefulness of the Echo Dot for my arrangement.  If I ask Alexa to stop playing music (in order to take a call, for example), the bluetooth connection with the Soundlink will eventually time out because the Soundlink will power off if nothing is playing after a period of time (maybe 15-20 minutes).  When this happens, the Echo Dot automatically resumes playing music through its built-in speaker, even though my last command to the Echo Dot was to stop playing music about 15-20 minutes earlier.  This obviously is bothersome (and embarrassing) when I'm in the middle of a work call, and all of a sudden the Echo Dot starts playing music right next to me.  This also happens whenever I manually power off the Soundlink speaker while it's connected via bluetooth to the Echo Dot.  I can't understand why the Echo Dot would be programmed to restart playing music whenever an external bluetooth speaker connection is terminated, even though nothing is playing when the disconnection occurs.  Perhaps my Echo Dot is defective, but I suspect this is just a bad design flaw/oversight.  I've since decided to return the Echo Dot, and just purchase another full size Amazon Echo for use in my office, and skip the whole bluetooth speaker connection problem. ",

So far (and I've only had it one day) I've found some great playlists and got the nap of my life to a &#34;sleep music&#34; playlist, set alarms and reminders and listened to my favourite radio station from back home in London.

Jeff,"December 15, 2016 ",3.0,"LOOOOOOOVE my Dots! I'm really getting used to talking to Alexa, getting helpful information, turning off and on music, lights, etc.    I have two desires in order to get to 5 stars:    1) Alexa confuses profiles if two Amazon Household members each have separate Amazon Prime accounts. My wife and I have separate Amazon accounts. However, when registered in Alexa as a household, she can't tell one calendar from another. This makes no sense to me, since each registered email address has its own GMail calendar, but according to Amazon Support, Alexa can't distinguish them if we have separate Amazon accounts. The result is she can only read from one calendar, regardless of which profile she's set to. It's a minor annoyance, but makes the calendar connection useless unless we close one of our Amazon accounts.    2) Alexa has a bit of trouble distinguishing Smart Home routines. For example, if you have 2 Smart Home routines called &#34;Enter Bedroom&#34; and &#34;Leave Bedroom&#34;, she always has to ask which one you really want, even though &#34;Enter&#34; and &#34;Leave&#34; sound nothing alike. If you remove the word &#34;Bedroom&#34; from both routines, then she's fine, which would be an option if I only had one room in my house! ",

Edwin,"November 29, 2016 ",5.0,"Man, I don't know what life was like before we got Alexa.  She makes our life easy.  She turns on and off all of our lights, our furnace, air conditioner, she even sets and changes the mood lights in our bedroom.  She is now my alarm clock, she plays music, and I used her a lot for new words as my talking dictionary.    Remember the days where you have to turn on your computer and Google something?  Well, now you can ask Alexa even if you just woke up from your bed like as her &#34;Alexa, what time is it?&#34;  You can even set an alarm for Alexa to wake you up in half an hour, or even play your favorite music.  I think what I like most about Alexa is that she has made my life that much easier especially when my hands are tied and I don't have a set of hands to turn on the lights, she can do that for me with a &#34;say a command!&#34;  I highly recommend you get one and once you do, you don't look back!!

"Helen Mayer","November 15, 2016 ",5.0,"I use it all the time to ask Alexa for the weather, the news, to play music, set a timer so I only spend so much time getting ready to go out...but the best reason, and the reason I ordered another for a different room,was for the My Buddy App. I am in a wheelchair, and occasionally have a fall. I have always been able to get up again, but if one day I can't, I can ask Alexa to alert one or all of the contacts I put into Ask My Buddy. Your contact(s) will be alerted by phone and by text that you need assistance. The service is free, but you can make a donation. ",
Blueviolet59,"November 29, 2016 ",5.0,"Like many people, I've been waiting for the whiz gadgets of the Jetsons and Star Trek to make it to my house. Well, this is the start!    I bought the Echo Dot because the price had dropped and we were looking for a way to control our lights when we're out of town...with an eye to adding other security features. The Dot not only works well at controlling appliances, but it also is a hoot for getting answers about other things. The weather, my upcoming schedule, the grocery list, who was Aaron Burr. She also tells jokes!    It was very easy to set up (you'll need wifi and your wifi password). We paired ours with the TP-Link Smart Plugs and have since been learning about the many things that Alexa can do. My husband thought it was a waste of money (geez, what's wrong with plugging the mechanical timers on the lights?), but has warmed up to the whole idea tremendously. Our next purchase will be replacement wall switches that can link to Alexa to control the ceiling fans and lights, and most likely a thermostat as well.    This would be a great gift to an older homeowner, especially someone with mobility issues, because it's all controlled by voice. ",
"Murl Harmon","March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"Know I say this having paid for the Echo Tap, you really only need to get the dot. It has a small speaker so no high definition sound, but I am not listening to music. I use this for information, checking my spelling, weather, and turning the lights on and off. I can sink up the Bluetooth speaker to it and get excellent sound for music and audio books (although for such a small speaker the dot does do OK) I was shocked that this does everything like the bigger Echo at 1/3 the cost. (yes minus the quality speaker) I really like this product and what it can do. ",
"Ashley B.","December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Great! Can do what the bigger one does (or so I hear) and we don't have any issues with the speaker being too quiet/not quality enough for what we're using it for. We use it for a variety of things but in a house with a 3-year old it is most often used as a kitchen, potty, or time-out timer- lol. We got it as a gift so I wouldn't have bought it myself just for that, but having a newborn on my hands it is so nice just to tell &#34;Alexa&#34; to play a song or start a timer for me. I'm sure with more time I will continue to learn how better to use the capabilities for further use. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 15, 2017 ",5.0,"I have two Echo dots and have them linked to several products in my house.  They are great, but one of them turns itself off randomly in the middle of an answer / function and reboots, often time several times in a row.  I am not sure why this happens and wish it would work properly!  When it is working I would highly recommend it if you can connect it to other products in your home and use it as a wireless &#34;controller&#34;!    Update: Customer service has been trying to help me work through this and while they have still not sorted it out completely that have been very helpful and I am confident that this will be resolved.

Frubbish,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This is one of those no-brainer tech gadgets that everyone should have, especially for the price.  The trickiest part of the Echo line is just getting in the habit of using it!  Is is so simple to setup and use, that it's a non-issue.  If you pick one up, i recommend actually reading the frequent emails that Amazon sends out that gives updates on the What's New with Alexa.  They are introducing new features all the time. ",

"M. Dembski","December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"Good first start. Good on dealing with Amazon but even there music integration is weak. Sometimes it plays just my music and sometimes prime. Voice recognition is good, not great. Google is better. When an internet search is required, performance is poor. Not sure if that Alexa or the Bing search engine but results are not very good. Alexa frequently appears to crash. Probably too many people using. Trying to get nearest restaurant bar etc is totally inaccurate. Locations are miles further away. No way to custumize TuneIn so frequently get wrong status. Does not get logic right unless you use exact wording. I have two and both drop the Bluetooth connection occasionally. It's not the speaker as it's rock solid to my phone. ",
"MommaCX3 ☀️","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"Great product. All the awesome features of Alexa minus the exceptional sound quality of the Echo. If you don't have an Echo you wouldn't know the sound isn't as good though (I don't think). We have the Dot in my son's room. He loves using it for weather updates, audiobooks, timers, various questions and music. We rely on our Echo for the most part for music but otherwise the Dot can't be beat, especially for the price. ",
Ash585,"November 2, 2016 ",3.0,"There are some great in-depth reviews already posted, but I mirror the general consensus that this is a great product. I purchased as a gift for someone that wants to easily stream music. This is very easy to use (set-up is simple via your smartphone) and so far no problems with Alexa recognizing music selections. One thing I haven't found mentioned in a review- If you're looking for 'pop' music, Alexa is fantastic at finding songs. If you're looking for 'classical,' or anything performed by specific orchestras or musicians, she's not as good at finding those yet. She'll find a version of Beethoven 6, but you might have a hard time asking for a specific orchestra playing it. ",
J4,"April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"Having Alexa is actually more useful than I thought it would be.  I bought one just to try out and see what it's like.  Having the ability to just ask a question without picking up a phone or device is great.  If you have a prime account and have amazon music it's even better, I find myself more often then not just asking Alexa to play a station or a song and because it's linked to my prime account the music plays without me having to go through my phone.  I was very surprised at how decent the speaker on the echo dot is, I was expecting a crappy small speaker that was really going to rely on connecting to a Bluetooth speaker or physical connection.  The device works really well as a standalone speaker for a decent size room.  I wouldn't trade in your nice speakers over it but if you have 2/3 dots around the house it actually works fine by itself.  I never would have foreseen myself buying multiple but after having one I can see the use for having one on each floor of my house, as a music player, as a device for asking the weather, asking questions, setting alarms, adding things to a list, making purchases, using it to control Alexa enabled devices.  It's definitely worth it for the price. ",
Chels,"November 25, 2016 ",5.0,"It doesn't get very loud but it works for a small room. I love that I can connect it to my phone and listen to my music, I can have Alexa change volume, pause, and switch songs all hands free. Sometimes it doesn't understand what you say so you have to try talking more clear, it doesn't understand kids very well. ",
"Billy B","December 16, 2016 ",4.0,"I was a very early adopter of the original Echo and wrote Amazon how they needed an Echo device that allowed Bluetooth OUT or wired audio OUT.  Yet I sat on this little gem without ordering one for a long time.  Finally pulled the trigger and am very glad I did.  Great device to hook up to your home audio system or Bluetooth speakers.  I have mine on a Bose Wave Radio in the Bedroom.  It's an amazing device that is my alarm clock, music and news source, and music entertainment.  It's simply amazing. ",
IMHO,"March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"This is an updated review.  My first Echo Dot was a failure, but the replacement is good.  My full size Echo has a better sound quality, but this little guy does the job and is small enough to sit in the kitchen and not get in the way! ***UPDATE*** I purchased the Bose Soundlink Mini 2 for my Echo Dot.  The sound is OK, HOWEVER, I also own a full size Echo and that sounds BETTER than the Echo Dot with the Bose Soundlink AND for less money!  That said, if you are focused on sound quality, it is my honest opinion that you would be better served with the full size Echo over the Dot with the Bose Mini 2.  Here is my initial review of the Echo:  I tried to get a video of this, but for some reason it won't load.  I'll try again later.  The dot works similar to the full size echo, although the sound quality is not as good.  The reason for two stars is that the dot frequently drops the internet connection and also seems to have a defective processing chip or something because when I leave it alone for more than half an hour and then speak to it, the response is a red ring and the comment of &#34;I'm having trouble understanding right now, please try again later&#34;.  Later will only happen if I unplug it and re-plug it in again.  I called technical support, and they are sending a replacement so I'll review my replacement and  update this review as this unfolds.  It is worth mention that I LOVE my full size Echo, and am still hopeful that the Dot will work. ",
"The Helpful Dad","October 25, 2016 ",5.0,"Overall we're impressed. The main reason I got it was to attach it to my existing stereo in order to stream music on zone 2 for my patio/bedroom/bath. I was just about to buy a Sonos Connect to do this (for over $300) but decided to try the Echo Dot first. I am so glad I did. The Echo does does a great job for this task - it connects to my stereo well and what's great is that Echo uses WIFI not bluetooth so the range to connect to it from your phone is much bigger. We can be on the opposite side of the house and use the phone to control Alexa and change the music.    Tip: I used an existing audio cable to attach to Echo Dot so you do not necessarily need to buy the extra audio cable if you already have one.  Tip: once you use voice control to activate Alexa to play music the first time, then you no longer need to keep using your voice to play music. You can just use the app on your phone and be in a different room. This is great. We can relax in the bedroom controlling Alexa while the Echo is in the living room.    The only thing I don't like is that there are minimal/almost no physical controls and the app is sometimes slow to use to control Alexa. ",
"Lisa Fite","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"*Alexa, play Jeopardy*  You know how you thought Siri was going to really revolutionize how you use your phone?  Then after a little while of asking her silly questions she just kind of became useless.  Well, Alexa (Dot) is like that.  After the fun of opening the box and setting *her* up, she just sort of becomes another thing on the counter or shelf.  Don't get me wrong, I like her, but she's just not that useful. I ask her about the weather and I enjoy playing Jeopardy every (week) day or having her play a song or two during dinner.  More often than not, I get frustrated because she can't do what I ask or I just plain forget she's there. ",
"H. Ramsey","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"This was a surprise Christmas gift and it turned out to be a very nice surprise! We had thought about purchasing it so the kids could ask it questions, but never seriously considered it. Then we received it gift.  Turns out it does a lot (a LOT) more than answer questions. The answering questions part is great, sometimes you have to rephrase it so Alexa understands what you are saying, but she does a good job answering 90% of the time.    She easily recognizes our voices. Even my 4 year old can trigger it most of the time. When there is a lot of noise in the background she can add a word or two, but she seems to be learning as you go and we have not tried the voice training with her yet (there are 6 of us in the house so a lot of background noise). The key seems to be learning how to say what you are asking. If you want a song then use the word &#34;play&#34; first, if you have a question then use the question word first, etc.    She does so much more than just answer questions. I love the news updates. I don't need to check my phone for top stories only to get distracted by the random junk that pops up with the news. You can choose the news channel (I saw BBC, NPR, CNN, Fox, and more offered). At the end of the top stories (goes about 5 minutes) she gives a weather update and forecast for your area. The update changes every hour so if you feel the need to get more news than go for it. Ask her if it is going to rain in the next hour, what the traffic is like for your commute, and more.    Playing whatever song/artist/station you want is a great way to listen to music. Want to hear a song - just ask.    The timer is useful. I used to grab my phone when I needed to set a timer, now I just ask Alexa. When the kids ask for tablet time or they need to do homework/reading time I can just ask Alexa to set the timer for me. This saves me going to my own tablet or phone (which I usually forget to do) and means the kids really get 15 minutes tablet time when I say they can rather than 45 minutes when I realize I forgot to set the timer.    She has so many skills that we have yet to try, but the ones we have are fun additions. There is a great game, magic door, that works like a choose your own adventure (complete with sound effects). The kids are currently in the middle of trying to find a wizard. You can pause the game and re-enter at any time. Alexa guesses what animal (or thing) you are thinking when you play 20 questions or the animal game. There is a bedtime story skill where she tells a random bedtime story using your child's name. After telling my 4 year old a princess story last night (using her name) she said &#34;now it is time for bed and no you can't have another glass of water&#34;. My daughter thought it was hilarious. It would be great for an elderly or bed-ridden person looking for something to talk to. It will also read audiobooks.    The kids love the joke feature (Alexa tell me a joke) and my husband likes trying to trip her up with random odd questions (What is the meaning of life, who's your daddy, who let the dogs out, etc). Ask her what her resolutions are or the highlights of the year. It is good for a laugh.    I haven't hooked her up to our thermostat yet and we don't have any smart lights/locks so I can't comment on that feature. I am seriously considering moving all my calendar stuff to google so she can plan my day for me. We put a code on ordering so the kids don't accidentally buy something (you can turn the feature off completely if you would rather), but you can still add things to lists when you think about them (then access that list in your amazon account).    Overall, great! I would even consider getting a few more (you could use it as an alarm clock plus extra features in a bedroom, to control things in your living room, this one is in our kitchen for lists/timers/etc).

All with the capability of being controlled over Wi-Fi with this little mechanism. I'm looking at upgrading to the Echo bad boy, but for the time being this thing is sweet and has so much potential for what I'm going to do. Will come in very handy around the house, being able to control my Thermostat or my lighting when I'm in a completely different room. Maybe having multiple of these around the house and centrally locate the Echo bad boy would help out. Need to look at getting a few Hubs set up so I can control Plex.

"Guerrilla Reader","March 28, 2017 ",2.0,"Review of: &#34;All-New Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,&#34; by Amazon.    The manufacturer specifications include: &#34;Echo Dot (2nd Generation) is a hands-free, voice-controlled device that uses Alexa to play music, control smart home devices, provide information, read the news, set alarms, and more.  Connects to speakers or headphones through Bluetooth or 3.5 mm stereo cable to play music from Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.  Controls lights, fans, switches, thermostats, garage doors, sprinklers, and more with compatible connected devices from WeMo, Philips Hue, Samsung SmartThings, Nest, ecobee, and others.  Hears you from across the room with 7 far-field microphones for hands-free control, even in noisy environments or while playing music.  Includes a built-in speaker so it can work on its own as a smart alarm clock in the bedroom, an assistant in the kitchen, or anywhere you might want a voice-controlled computer.  Always getting smarter and adding new features, plus thousands of skills like Uber, Domino's, and more.  Amazon Echo is not required to use Echo Dot.&#34;    The Echo Dot is a really cool limited personal assistant.  It sets up in minutes and begins to work immediately thereafter.  Upon summoning Alexa I was able to subscribe to Prime Music with access to millions of songs; get immediate current weather and moon phase; create a running shopping list; and re-order products from my Amazon order list. Although I am not familiar with all of the features that the Echo Dot allows, one feature that really impresses me is the interactive process with Alexa and the (her) smooth voice.  I just asked Alexa to sync up with my Kindle and she began to read the last book I purchased.  Her voice is incredibly human-like with proper rate of speech, phrasing, inflection, intensity, syntax, and voice stress.  There is little tinny robotic sound, if any.  What an incredible advancement over previous technology used in the Kindle!  I enjoy asking Alexa any multitude of questions which usually she will answer.  Alexa answers my questions on history, facts, etc. and of course will tell a joke on demand.  This is a cool and fun device which I described to my family as a limited personal assistant.  I will update this review as time progresses.  The Echo Dot in terms of a speaker will easily fill an average room with clear sound.  Obviously there is no thumping bass, etc. but the sound is pretty remarkable from such a small device.  I just downloaded the Alexa App onto my iPhone to help me work the unit as well.  Another feature is that Alexa responds immediately.  When I command Alexa to stop the music the unit goes silent as I am finishing the command.  It is amazing.  At this point I would recommend the Echo Dot to anyone and rate it at five stars for a competitive price and lots of features.  I am sure that more will be added each year.  Well done! ",
"Clark Hinckley","March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"As advertised. Small and unobtrusive, works well, connects easily and seamlessly to bluetooth speakers. In reality, there are still only a relatively limited number of truly useful things you do with Alexa unless you are creating an extensive automated home - multiple lights, various living conditions, locks, AV, etc., all with a large price and complex set up. Does not have as many answers to random (but interesting) questions as Siri (which can also answer visually on your phone or iPad screen). But this is a good start, fun to use, and has generally set the standard for simplicity and seamless operation. ",
KMMR,"December 27, 2016 ",5.0,"I love this thing! It is a bit weird to have these types of electronics always doing things in my home but I have come to really enjoy my Echo. I ask Alexa a ton of questions. I love the games she will play and stories she tells. My only complaint is that Alexa needs more personality, like the Google Home unit has (my folks have that one so I get to play with both). Other than that, the Echo rocks. I have it hooked up to my Smart Home system which allows me to use voice commands on certain functions of my house, which is totally awesome. ",
"Real Story","March 3, 2017 ",4.0,"I've been using Siri and Cortana faithfully. I'm probably one of the few prople that use them all day everyday. So, I thought the dot would round out my usage by adding them where the other assistants were not. I found Alexa couldn't even tell me how many kilobytes to a megabyte. I have a slew of questions that show on the app correctly but sadly she only answered very few. I have 30 days with BestBuy to return them, so I'll give it a few more tries but it's not looking so good. ",

I performed a hard-reset which got it working for a while longer, then the issue has occurred a few times since. I contacted Amazon about the issue, but was told there was nothing they could do about it since it's out of warranty. This is truly the reason for my low-star rating. ",
"K. Biegler","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Well what can you say? Ok, One day I told Alexa that, 'I loved her' ... she answered back ... 'That's nice, Thank You' ... so I guess we're going to only be 'just friends' :-D    It's a pretty nice small device, if you are looking for audiophile fantastic ... no ... but for the nightstand and controlling Nest and hopefully lights as well as streaming music it's a pretty nice addition to the home. Looking forward to the new battery pack when it arrives and hopefully they are on schedule with teaching her to control my Sonos for now though streaming radio stations from around the country via the web or Pandora we are loving it ... getting weather, news briefs and setting alarms with simple voice commands is pretty nice.

"Clark Wilson","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"This 2nd gen Dot is our third Echo device.  We started with the original Echo and loved it.  The original seems the best of the three.  I have it in the home office.  We followed up with a 1st gen Dot when they became available and set it up with a bluetooth speaker in our bedroom.  The third we placed in our kitchen.    The first Echo seems most responsive.  It immediately answers questions and requests and the speaker is actually quite good.  However, I think it might be location and placement.  It sits on the counter and there are few ambient noises around.    The second in our bedroom works fairly well. We probably use it the most.  The speaker seems a little &#34;tinny&#34;. We hooked it up to a small bluetooth speaker and it does well.  My wife relocated it to the top of a display cabinet so Alexa struggles to hear there a bit.    Our newest addition is the 2nd gen Dot and it was placed in the kitchen.  We have been slower to adopt it to kitchen tasks only because it is habit to set timers and such in there manually.  Adding items to the shopping list is really cool.  If they can add a feature to allow multiple items at a time it would be great.  We do use it a lot for music, internet radio and news etc.  The kitchen Dot does struggle a little with ambient sound and I have moved it around the kitchen to get better responses.    None of the Dots conflict with the other and setup for all were very easy.    We have just started collecting Alexa enabled outlets and have started automating some lighting.  We have a Wemo and now a handful of TP Link to experiment with.  All fairly easy to install.    I plan to purchase one more Dot for my garage workshop.  I want to use it to automate some workshop and yard lighting as well as have hands free music etc available.  We will see how the noise there affects it. ",

My brother-in-law is a new gadget person and has everything but he didn't have this and he had not even seen it.  I couldn't have bought a better present for him.

She can't answer a lot of questions but she functions as a calculator, dictionary, timer, alarm clock, music streamer, and her skills are like apps on your phone and she has a few good ones. Overall, worth the price. Thanks Amazon, cool deal!    Surprisingly, her speaker is nice and smooth sounding, although there is practically no bass at all. There is clear midrange and highs are present so the music is enjoyable through her. The speaker is on the bottom, interestingly done, but if you sit her on the bed you can't hear her well. =) ",
"Matt [Eight-Six]","January 6, 2017 ",5.0,"We currently use two of these at home, and gave one to our parents to try out too.    Our home is host to products like WeMo, and Nest, and the Echo Dot effortlessly detects and and communicates with these smart devices well. I would like to see further support for some devices (I know Sonos is coming) but the sooner the better in my opinion. We also use Google Homes and while the Homes are nice, the Dot seems to be more on point with the devices it talks to.    On occasion Alexa will answer 'OK' and not execute the command given, making asking her twice to do the action a little bit of a nuisance. It's a small issue but likely a problem for that of the devices (like WeMo) that she attempts to talk to.    I also don't like how Amazon works with IFTTT. Having to setup 'trigger' is annoying when the competition will execute the command without saying 'sending that to IFTTT.' To me it makes it less awesome and seamless.    Example if using IFTTT: (I'm Home is the command for turning the lights/thermostat on)    &#34;Alexa Trigger I'm Home&#34; and she responds &#34;Sending that to IFTTT&#34;    Using the competition:    &#34;OK Google I'm home&#34; and hearing &#34;Welcome Home!&#34; is a much nicer experience.    Now it is fair to say that you can setup groups in the Alexa App, to do something similar (not using IFTTT), but the reason I mention this stuff is because some things will require support from IFTTT, and the way they work together (at the time of this review) is annoying.    I also recommend using an external speaker for her to communicate through. The added 3.5 aux audio jack was a nice inclusion for the Dot. I assume they knew this would be something people wanted and unlike the competitions sub-par speaker and no DIRECT audio out, I find this a nice thing to have. Both dots utilize a much better external speaker, and sit on top of said speakers. This adds to the better experience listening to music, and hearing her more clearly.    The sooner it supports my Sonos, the better. :)    I'd recommend this if you have interest in trying out home automation. It is great, with some minor set backs (likely just personal grievances subjective to my own tastes) ",

JerryP,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I am a techie that has been troubled in getting on board with the smart watches and voice everything. I grabbed a Dot (too cheap for the Echo). I am floored at the complexity yet usability of this thing. And was totally shocked on how decent it sounded. No it is not going to rattle the windows but I really expected it to be unusable for background music. It really has a decent sound so will not be adding speakers to it. I am just learning how to connect to a few gadgets and the vocabulary will take a little more work. But I really am impressed. Out of the many gadgets I have purchased - this one is staying put! Now I am on the hunt for more gadgets to interface with it! ",
GG,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"My husband and I love our Echo Dot. He got me the Dot for Christmas and we both enjoy having it in our place. We were pleasantly surprised because we didn't really have a lot of expectations for it (&#34;at the very least it's an alarm clock&#34;), but boy did it deliver. So far we use it for setting timers, alarms, adding events on calendars, ordering on Amazon, playing music (we have Spotify and Amazon Music), reading books (we both have Kindles with a shared library), playing audiobooks (I have an audible account), getting commute info, getting weather forecasts, asking for store hours, getting daily news updates (we customized our flash briefing to start with the &#34;saint of the day&#34;), answering random questions, and a couple other things. We connect it to a JBL Charge 3 speaker, but we use it on its own for the most part. We're currently looking into making our place a smart home, so we're definitely picking those that can be integrated with our Dot. All in all, we love it. Corresponds to our simple daily tasks and we just have fun with it. For $50, it's a great buy! ",
"iutaro girotto","December 13, 2016 ",5.0,"The Alexa dot is a godsend, i kept waiting for a black Friday discount since its release to get an echo, for 50$ this device is a steal, BUT, there is not much the device can do by itself, I use Alexa mostly for home automation, so I got a hue white kit(big mistake) and a blumoo(small mistake), the Phillips hue works GREAT! but only as long as you use hue bulbs, if you want third party bulbs STAY AWAY from Phillips hue!, the HUE whites are actually yellow, I dislike that color and that makes the room look old if you can understand what I mean, so I got the cree white 5000k, they are nice and white,so go for a wink or a Samsung smart things, they work way better, now to clarify you CAN add third party bulbs on hue from time to time but is really hard, and every other update they mess it up and it wont detect them again.    The blumoo only works for apple and not android so I had to borrow an old iPhone 4 that i have to keep always on in the house to make it work, wich bothers me to no end, but once you get it to work is awesome, turning on the AC, TV and Home theater 6 with a single voice command makes you feel like captain of a spaceship, if you can't get an IOS device with at least IOS7 i suggest you get anymote home, since its interface is better anyway.    the speaker is perfect for a bedroom, is just loud enough, is safe to say the echo is the best alarm clock on planet earth, I just say to Alexa at what time I want to be awake the next day and done, if you are a prime member it also comes with prime music which granted, doesn't have as many songs as Spotify is good enough, it can work with pandora and spotify as well if you are a member of those services, it's great for playing music, you can just ask her to play genre, author or specific song and thats it ",
"Charles S. Pickard","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I am an audiophile and am amazed at the good fidelity that can be obtained with the new Echo Dot II.  One of your reviewers suggested a direct cable connection to the speakers vs. Bluetooth is better.  I normally agree but can not hear any differnce using the Bose Mini Soundlink II speakers.  That combination far outperforms the larger Echo for fidelity. (I undrestand there will be a new Echo with improved speakers next year.)  Bluetooth has improved so much in the last 5 years I am beginning to ignore my collections of  CD's and LP's.    I am so impressed with the Echo Dot II that I will order 2-3 more.  The price is a steal for what it will do.  Setup and pairing is easy. The Alexa app. works with both the Echo and the Echo Dot.  The access to good music from several excellent sources makes it unecessary to search through my CD and LP collection.    If you have a decent pair of bluetooth speakers, I suggest pairing with the Echo Dot. It creates a great sound system.  Even alone the speaker in the Dot is OK. But for the price you can't do better.

"Amazon Customer","November 17, 2016 ",5.0,"Update: 3-11-17  Still like the dot, but it's not as reliable as the original echo's that I have.    Love the echo's so much that I have 2 echos and a dot! I use it for everything. Play music, use it for my lights, set timers, set lighting routines, check my commute. The list goes on and on. ",
Melanie,"December 21, 2016 ",5.0,"The only con was there not many instructions in the box,  so several people aren't aware that some skills need to be enabled ( which can be done with a simple voice command Alexa enable x skill ). Additionally, Alexa will function much more efficiently if you do voice training found in your Alexa app settings This helps her learn your particular speech patterns.  It only takes a few min and greatly improved her accuracy with my cadence.  I'm flooored by this device. My family loves it and cannot imagine not having her around.  Anyone who purchases this should understand,  AI is like an infant and the more you engage, the faster it will learn. Try enabling the game ahkinon (spelled phonetically) think of any character real or fictional,  she guesses right every time.  Some other fun skills that need to be enabled to enjoy are Wayne investigations,  Jeopardy,  7 min workout.  More skills are constantly being added. I love audible books and alexa reads to me at night, and will resume where we left off anytime I've asked her to stop. She's amazing. ",
"Brian Daniels","December 4, 2016 ",3.0,"A solid five if ever there was one. While the Dot may not have the sound output of the larger original Echo, the Bluetooth and wired options more than make up for it. My Dot is paired with a Marshall Kilburn and the sound is fantastic and LOUD. While I was satisfied with the  original device's sound quality, I wanted the option of a little more punch. This combo certainly fits the bill. The Dot also quickly pairs with my other speakers and headphones, but it's pretty much always paired with the Kilburn now. I have had no problems with the Dot failing to respond. The only problem came when I changed the &#34;activate&#34; word to &#34;Echo&#34;. The Dot seemed to hear that quite often from the police scanner located nearby. Made for some interesting commands when I checked the Alexa app. How could Alexa not understand, &#34;about you have a girl bell about barack operator travel ninety five stop.&#34;? What's not clear? I suspect the two syllable &#34;activate&#34; word is at fault here. When I changed it to &#34;Amazon&#34; the accidental queries stopped. That aside I am thrilled with the Dot and it may well solve my Christmas shopping chores this year. ",
CrankyFuzz,"January 3, 2017 ",5.0,"Wonderful little device (alexa, ask for a fart)  This device is full of endless fun and resources. Out of the box it works wonderfully but as you gradually add in or enable various skills you will find this device to be extremely handy.  You can ask for recipes, you can list a few ingreds in your fridge and ask what CAN you make, you can add to your google calendar (it wont alert you if you have an appointment which is kind of crappy)    My ONLY complaint is this: Periodically I have to ask alexa to repeat because not all of her sentences come through clear. Example: Alexa, whats on my calendar tomorrow?  Alexa: You have an appointment with the eye doctor at (long pause) 30 pm.  Alexa, how do you like Jeff Bezos? Answer: He (long pause) Prime!  So fortunately that is my only complaint. I have contacted support which instructed me to move it close to the router, power down and restart it, hard reset  and nothing has worked as of yet and I have a great wifi signal in its current placement.    Please don't get to frustrated with her, she is young and still learning! ",
Tylerrrr,"October 26, 2016 ",5.0,"I love this thing more and more as time goes on. Want to know what the weather is going to be ? Ask alexa. Basketball scores ? Ask alexa. I even hooked it up to my home automation devices (WeMo switches) so I can turn the lights on and off in my room with a simple voice command. It even lets you create groups so you can say &#34;turn off all lights&#34; or choose specific ones like &#34;turn off the living room lamp&#34;. For only $50 it's a steal. I wouldn't use it for playing music, but it does have aux out so you could connect a nice pair of bookshelf speakers if you don't have a nice speaker setup already. ",
Tony,"November 29, 2016 ",4.0,"Update:March 4, 2017  🅿🆁🅾🆂  🔶Good value for the price  🔶Has an audio output port so you can hook it up to your own set of speakers, so this would be advantageous over the original if you have a good set of speakers (Echo version does not have the audio out port, however the unit's speakers are better)  🔶Good value for the price  🔶Thousands of skills and new ones are added daily  🔶Small and compact, well constructed  🔶Durable, I have had it for over 6 months now and it is in still in excellent condition  🔶Offers tons of convenience: I can turn on the lights without getting out of the bed, ask for the weather, time, news, alarm etc  🔶I can listen to prime music, popular stations, create my own playlist as well upload own collection of songs and listen to those  🔶Setup was very straight forward and only took me a few minutes    🅲🅾🅽🆂  🔶Speakers are adequate for listening to songs, but could definitely be better (I have a set of bose speakers so I hook Alexa up to those and it sounds fantastic)  🔶Voice recognition is good if there is no other noise in the background, however if I am playing music sometimes I have to shout in order for Alexa to hear me. On occasion however, Alexa does have trouble understanding certain words that I say to her if she has never heard it before and certain words even if she has heard them before, sometimes she misinterprets them for something else. However, it seems she is getting better at understanding what I tell her once I use that command more often.    Overall, I am still very happy with the purchase of the echo dot and would definitely recommend it for the value that it brings to my daily life.    Oct 2016: This is my first Echo and I have to say it is one o the best valued purchased that I have made in my entire life.  I have been wanting to get an Echo for sometime now, but have been put off by the price of the original Amazon Echo. As soon as this affordable model came out I knew I had to get it and I had one unit on preorder. When I finally received this unit last Thursday, I was suprised at how compact in size it is. After plugging it in and setting it up, which took about 1-2 minutes I immediately fell in love with it.  The setup process was extremely straight forward and quick. I already had a bose campanion sets of speaks so I just used the AUX out cable to plug the echo into my speakers. However even without the use of an outside set of speakers, I thought the echo dot still sounded relatively decent even for playing music. Alexa was able to recognize pretty much everything that I asked her to do such as turning on the light, playing music, asking about the weather, the news etc. Even when I am outside the room, about 10 feet away from her she can easily hear my normal speaking voice. The only time that she has trouble hearing me is when I have her playing really loud music, which is to expected considering I would not be able to hear someone talking in a loud room. She also has the ability to learn your speech pattern and voice the more often you use her, so she can better recognize and understand what it is that you want her to do. I also love the set alarm feature on her, I can simply tell her to set an alarm for 10 minutes or set an alarm for 8 am the next day without having to go onto my phone in the middle of the night. Another awesome feature about her is definitely how she can control smart light bulbs. For someone that is lazy as I am when getting out of bed at night to turn off the light, it is such a blessing to be able to simply say &#34;Alexa turn off the light.&#34; Another neat feature about her is that lately I have been having insomnia due to a big state board examination coming up, so I have been using her to help me sleep by playing relaxing ambiance. At the moment, you also change her name from Alexa to either Echo or Amazon. I currently have her under Echo in my room and Alexa in the living room since sometimes when I am calling to Alexa, the echo in the living room would pick it up as well. After getting my 1st unit, I ended up getting the 5 for 6 echo deal as I wanted another one in my living room as well and I also wanted to give some away as gifts to my family and friends. For $250 for 6 units, plus 5% cash back from discover credit card and the $5 gift card balance after reloading $100, each unit ended up costing me $38.75 which is just awesome value for all of the features that she can provide.

"Jon P.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have loved my Amazon Echo that I have had for nearly 2 years.  I love being able to use the Amazon Echo for voice control of my living room lights and other compatible devices (i.e. my Nest thermostat).  The cost of the Amazon Echo was the only thing holding me back from putting one in other parts of the house.  As soon as I saw the Echo Dot (2nd gen) advertised for sale I immediately ordered 3 of them to put in other parts of my house.  I already had a good speaker system in my bedroom so I added a Dot there.  I put another in my wife's office and attached a set of Bose speakers and I put one in the Kitchen (no external speakers but that one is not for listening to music).    All 3 Dots were incredibly easy to set up and all are working perfectly.  The only difference I noticed about them compared to the Amazon Echo (besides the sound quality) is the dots seem to take slightly longer to turn my lights on and off.  I am not 100% sure they take longer but it seems like they are just a bit slower but not enough to really make a difference. ",
Raj,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"A perfect Operating System for a smart home. Have connected it with my ecobee3, Osram Lighitify, Microsoft outlook account, Spotify account, Bose speakers. Has made life super simple and exciting! Voice controls work like a charm on all these devices. The smart home skill app library is super vast and is very exciting to see more partners getting added each day! The speaker quality is agreeably good, i am happy to listen to some mellow music on them without turning on my bose speakers. The MIC is exceptionally good and understands my voice and accent from any corner of the room. ",

I have one in the kitchen and have found it so useful for playing music, getting weather, asking about measurements,  and hearing what is going on in the news I decided to get one for my office so I can control the lights as well. It seems like there are more and more things it is able to do and can hear you so well it's mind boggling. I have gotten so use to Apple Siri sucking so bad I was a little nervous, but Echo is on a completely different level. Buy one to check it out and when you fall in love with it, get another one for anther room! ",
"TG RabidBeaver","April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"Next to sliced bread, the wheel and fire, the Amazon Echo Dot may be the single greatest invention ever (perhaps even better than gravity itself).    I bought one after seeing a good friend's setup where he utilizes his dot along with his Nest thermostat and his Hue Lighting.  I must say, anything that helps me be lazier when I am at home, it truly gets two thumbs up.  Now if I could just convince Alexa to bring me 2 fingers of my favorite Bourbon while I'm watching the game......    Come on Amazon, make it happen! ",
gn27,"March 18, 2017 ",5.0,"Started out really good, but now I have to say things twice before they actually happen. Everyday it's &#34;Alexa turn on the lights&#34; then she thinks for a minute and nothing happens, so then I say it again and by then it usually works. This happens with many things and the problem is absolutely with the echo and not the smart lights because most of the time the echo never responds. Hopefully amazon will make this product better, right now it seems to have quite a few glitches. ",
Sanqofa,"March 29, 2017 ",5.0,"Friends told me about Alexa, but I now am a witness to this device.  Set up is a breeze and just looking at all of the skills that Amazon has is pleasantly overwhelming.  What pushed me over (may not be a big deal to anyone else) was the same You Version Bible App that I have on my phone.  I have set a daily plan for Alexa to read the Bible to me.    As well as, other mobile apps that I have previously used, were found in Alexa skills.  I normally don't write any review.... however this was worth taking time to share my excitement about the Amazon Echo Dot 2nd Generation.  I'm sure I will discover other skills for Alexa, but the You Version Bible App was worthy to share my two cents!    Great Job Amazon! ",
"T. Sheridan","March 1, 2017 ",2.0,"I liked my tap, now I love the dot. I have the tap in my office because I am always on conference calls, I didn't want it to have any &#34;false alarms.&#34; I added the Dot to the family room and use it most often to control the lights, thermostat, and other devices around the house. It's also useful for random questions while watching movies, such as bios on actors or &#34;Is so-and-so dead or alive?&#34;  The voice recognition is very good, but you do need to practice a bit to be understood consistently.

jab,"March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"Just got it yesterday and I also purchased a speaker system for computer from another store. I know the speakers not real loud but it works great. The speaker itself is about the volume of my iPhone.  It is not stereo for music.  Adding the speakers that I purchased I have more of a complete stero sound. It also reads my latest novel on kindle on my fire tablet  I do not have a smart TV or smart lights but what it does is fine with me. A great System for senior citizens  and especially if they have had Eye surgery  OK, I have had this echo dot  for two weeks and loved it in. I went to another store and picked up another echo for my bedroom. I just ordered  a smart lightbulb for my bedroom  that should work with my echo. I have signed up for my buddy and that will work in my bedroom and my living room.  The only problem I had when I called the name  Alexa as I called it too fast and it doesn't recognize it. I've had to say the name slowly and then it recognizes it. ",
"Justin Andrew Mayer","April 23, 2017 ",5.0,"I think I must have a defective one....Alexa is the dumbest artificial intelligence ever!  The only thing she is honestly good for is the weather and playing songs.  If we ask her 20 questions she might know the answers to 2 of them....super over rated and over hyped!  Should have just spent the extra money for the Google home.  It works for controlling the thermostat like 50% of the time lol!  Amazon still has TONS of work ahead of them with these lot's of improvements needed.  Most people seem to have better luck them me but everyone that comes over can't believe how useless this thing really is! ",
"B. Hopkins","January 3, 2017 ",5.0,"Great idea in theory. I purchased it for my husband so he could play music while recovering from surgery.  We have a household prime account, but since it is in my name. He can't access prime music on the device. We could switch it to my account and then I could access music I purchased, but then he wouldn't be able to access music he purchased. I called Amazon and asked if we could merge our accounts.  The answer is NO.  You also cannot apparently have more than one account associated with it. You can open a new account and purchase all your music again was what they said. It is also very difficult to figure out what music you can play. We are old enough to remember LPs and we want to own our music.  That just doesn't work very well with a device like this. Too bad. It is a nice idea, but having it as an individual device rather than linked to the house is stupid. ",
Forrest,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Just recieved my Echo Dot a few days ago as a graduation gift and it has been truly life changing! This is the all-in-one solution I have been looking for my old Sony G Box.     Prior to this I was using Chromecast audio and a Bluetooth adapter that fit on top of the iPod dock using the old apple standard so I would have to constantly walk up to the box and switch between Bluetooth and castiing which took up a lot of time. The reason I did this was because I like to stream from multiple music services like Apple Music and Spotify but you could only listen over wifi with Spotify because Apple Music doesn't support it.    Echo Dot has Bluetooth built in so I can seamlessly switch to services (like Apple Music) that don't support wifi streaming with just a simple voice command!    Speaking of voice commands so far Alexa has been able to understand me most of the time and it's been really convient. You do have to give up some privacy with the voice commands but there is a switch on the device to turn the mic off which is nice.    My only issue is not with the device itself but with the Alexa app. Amazon needs more developers to work on it to make it more intuitive and faster. Right now the app feels clunky and slow. If Amazon can fix this issue than it will be perfect. I'm still giving a five star rating because the device is just so good. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I bought this for my kitchen.  After the warranty expired it started malfunctioning.  Turns off after one minute of playing music.  Does not understand what I ask it. Loses it connection from the internet all the time.  Basically its useless because it never stays on.  Of course amazon was willing to talk me through trouble shooting but not replace a defective product that is only four months old. ",
~A,"December 25, 2016 ",5.0,"Yes it's limited and what it does however if you're going to buy one of these, the. Is the way to go. You can plug it into whatever speakers you want and just pay fifty bucks for the DOT. The more time you spend with it, adding skills and whatnot, the more you will get out of it. It seems to like deeper voices however, so I have to talk fairly loud if there's background noise. That's really the only drawback. Otherwise I use Amazon music, audible books, news updates, all without touching my electronic. ",
Netcruiser2,"April 4, 2017 ",1.0,"Bought as Christmas gift for my Mom and she loves it so far.  Mostly uses for weather, time, maybe an occasional alarm, and shopping lists.  Sometimes it doesn't always understand but you have to speak after it displays the ring once you provide the wake up word, &#34;Alexa&#34;.  Great product, highly recommend if you like to control compatible gadgets too. I own an Echo myself and I love controlling my wifi Thermostats and listening to radio stations and my favorite tunes online.  Highly recommended! ",
"R. Shuck","April 16, 2017 ",5.0,"It's an echo device, so it's pretty good. The full sized echo has a better speaker. This seems to respond well, and if by chance your other Echo products &#34;hear&#34; you say something, it looks like Amazon created a method that will only allow one device to respond/comply. For instance, if I say Alexa, the dot or the Echo will light up the ring, and one of them will turn off. It may select by the quality of your voice input as detected by the microphones, but either way, it won't double-add stuff to your shopping list or anything like that. It also seems to know now what the Echo commercials sound like, so if someone on TV calls it out, your echo will light the ring and then go right back off.    I have found the Echo's achilles heel though: white noise. A white noise source like a nature sound machine/app/dream machine can make it very difficult for the Echo to hear you, even if it's streaming that sound via bluetooth. I don't know if there's a fix or workaround, but be prepared. ",
AmazonianShark,"April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"Honestly, its kind of useless. I ask simple questions I could get answered on Google and its always, &#34;I can't answer that&#34;, &#34;I didn't understand your question&#34; or something of the sort. Also, she doesn't seem to understand some words that are extremely simple. When playing trivia games, for example, she hears words that are completely different from what was actually said. So far the best attributes are being able to set an alarm by voice command and being able to play SOME music without having to scroll through my phone or other device. Maybe I just had higher expectations for a &#34;smart&#34; device. I'm probably going to return this and invest in a google home instead. ",
Ducky,"November 4, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my echo dot...works great with the Alexa app and I can set grocery lists, get weather, ask sports questions and game times.  Best of all, I was able to connect to a Wifi light bulb from the Alexa app and now am able to tell Echo to turn my lights on and off.    You are also able to create groups of lights and name them for the different parts of your house.    This thing can also play music for you from Spotify, Amazon Music, etc and the speaker is surprisingly good and loud as well for its small size!    Very happy with this purchase! ",
loki,"April 16, 2017 ",1.0,"Alexa, how satisfied am I with this purchase?  Extremely!  Bought the Echo Dot as a Christmas present when it was on sale.  We use it as a medication reminder that alerts my Mom twice a day, every day at preset times. She is 94 years old but still learned how to say, &#34;Alexa, stop&#34; to turn off the alarm and take her meds on time.

"Patrick Johnston","February 3, 2017 ",5.0,"Great when it works but it drops connection all the time. The device even red rings because it can't connect. Spotify gets interrupted sometime every 5 minutes. It's frustrating and with limited options on the device there is not much you can do. The device is 1 foot from my router and no other devices have an issue. I would recommend they put an Ethernet jack on the device maybe that would fix the unreliability.    Not much point in bothering with amazon support. They don't respond to email. ",
"Les Martin","April 11, 2017 ",5.0,"My wife hated the idea of the Echo.  After seeing this at a couple of people's houses I was sold.  I have a very nice but old Bose Wave Radio in my kitchen so I really didn't need the full blown Echo and I didn't want to spend that much money.  When it arrived and I began using it and my wife was not happy.  After I showed her how to add things to the shopping list and play music she began to come around.  We now use the Echo Dot and app to manage our weekly grocery list.  I even come home to find her using the Dot to play music.  Next I need to sell her on the idea of connected bulbs, switches and outlets.  Asking for forgiveness is probably the best policy.    This device is a great way to get the functionality you want without spending a lot.  I have had relatively few issues with the device.  I held off for a while but since I started pairing my Dot with my iPhone 6 Plus I have found yet another use.  I can play podcasts without the clunky process via voice commands and TuneIn.  It's even simple to disconnect from the device just using a verbal command which then allows me to move to another area of the house and connect to a different speaker.    I plan to buy more of these if and when I expand my use of them.  The media room seems to be the next room in need of an Echo. ",
"J Herrell","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Pretty cool little gadget, our family loves it! I didn't give it 5 Stars because I am already a Prime subscriber but I need to pay extra for Amazon music. I also didn't realize it didn't cover both my Alexa products, I signed up for Amazon music on my Dot which is also connected to my app but it doesn't play on my Echo. Apparently you have to pay a fee per device every month. I think that is silly and I will be canceling my subscription on the Dot and just doing it on the Echo because we use that one more.  My favorite part is, I blew up my white noise maker while in Italy (bad outlet converter) and I can put white noise (Pure White Noise by Deep Sound Sleep) on and press repeat for white noise all night while I sleep.  We also like the &#34;skills&#34;, especially the Tonight Show skill, you can ask Alexa what everyone is talking about and she states the &#34;tight pants&#34; song lyrics which is a family favorite.  Overall I am happy with it. ",
"Misha Lupisha","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Oh my. How easy it was to start using it. It is a true plug-and-play.  When Amazon announced the new Echo Dot, I ordered it right away. (In fact, I ordered two, and holding one as a holiday gift to my son.) My son thought it was going to be just another gadget, but he uses mine just about everyday, and I can see that he is going to want his own to use in his room. The accessibility to music is great. Lots of &#34;skills&#34; already built in, and I'm looking forward to discovering more skills as they become available. Right now we mainly use it for playing music, but it's also handy to just be able to ask what time it is in any foreign country, as I often communicate with overseas for work and with family.  We hooked our Dot up to a good set of Bose speakers, but even without the external speakers, it has a pretty good speaker if you are hearing it in a small room. The voice recognition is amazingly accurate. I am impressed. I wasn't at all interested in the earlier version of Echo, but with this tiny size of Dot, I was sold! I LOVE it. ",
"S. Gladwin","March 7, 2017 ",4.0,"One of the most used devices in my home. I have it set up as an alarm clock (set only for weekdays, nice touch) but use it quite often to stream music, including radio stations all over the Country (Playing New Orleans Jazz radio up here in New England is awesome!) as well as have it linked with my smart devices throughout the home. Best part is that my Dot is in my kitchen and from my upstairs bedroom I can ask  it to play music, tell me the time, etc. and even with the echos it still gets my commands right almost always.    Great little device, I'm looking forward to what it can do in the future. ",
Fegarex,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"When the original Echo came out I wanted one but didn't want to pay the price. I bought mine at $49.95 and they have been less and are well worth the price. It makes a good stepping stone for home automation or really improves an existing system. I have most of my home automated and the addition of the Echo Dot was seamless. Like all things like this it does take a bit of messing around but it worked well and set up was easy. The ability for it to hear voice commands is fantastic. I can be in other rooms and say a command. It is also fast. I think many times it works faster than a tablet for the remote commands. Sound is adequate but I wasn't that concerned about that as I listen to my music on a stereo. I did have a set of better computer speakers I added to it to improve sound/volume but the speaker in it works decent for voice.  Alexa isn't as good as Google voice for a variety of questions but does well with many and ties into Amazon well.  It amazes me how much this thing will do for $50.00!! ",
"Robert Ricks","December 7, 2016 ",5.0,"Unexpectedly useful. Love the hands free timer in the kitchen. Adding items to shopping or &#34;to do&#34; lists for later review on the app is easy.    Responsiveness, accuracy and integrated speaker are better than anticipated.  Considering adding another Dot to bedroom to replace alarm clock.    Haven't considered home automation yet.    Cons vs Google Home:  1) each Dot operates independently (multi-room synch not yet avail for Dot, Echo or Tap).  2) Google Home has wider range of promo music (pulls from Youtube red)    Pros:  1) only $40 (promo price). Great entry into voice automation. However, Chromecast audio is certainly a challenger if you only need to connect streaming audio to your dumb speakers (Best Buy sale $25).    Overall, the Dot is a great choice for the kitchen or bedroom. Chromecast audio might be a cheaper choice to connect to your &#34;dumb&#34; speakers and set up multi room audio but it lacks bluetooth and voice recognition. ",
"Cassie H","December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought this along with the Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3 for my father's birthday. Unfortunately, I learned after the fact that Alexa does not work with my father's phone, but only mine. He has a Galaxy and I have an iPhone. Apparently his phone does not have the Alexa app which is needed in order to properly use Alexa. She is useful once you learn what she can actually do, but it can be frustrating when you can't remember the exact command sequence so Alexa cannot answer your question. Overall, a great invention, but I think its been harder for us to learn Alexa than it is for Alexa to learn us. ",

"Amazon Customer","December 8, 2016 ",3.0,"We've had an echo for a long  time. We were one of the first in the beta deal and got it for a very cheap price. We use it much more than I thought we ever would. My wife loves it for music, math equations, food measurement conversions, weather, and news. We also have it controlling our lights and our ecobee thermostat. We just got the echo dot and I must admit I think I like it even more. I bluetooth-ed it to my Bose mini soundlink and it sounds fantastic. Other than that, it performs equally as good as our full sized echo but it's much smaller and way cheaper. We got it for the black friday price of $39.99 which to me is a steal for all it can do. The Googe Home seemed interesting but for Less than $50, and the ability to hook up to stereo or bluetooth speakers, the dot just seems the better choice. If you can still get it on sale, I think it's an excellent deal and has been very helpful and entertaining for our family. It doesn't do everything but what it does do, it does well for a cheap price. ",
"E. Jones","January 1, 2017 ",5.0,"Works great however a lot of times it doesn't understand things I am asking her. Such as, looking  up something on the Internet. You have to be more defined in your search or your questions. And for the traffic it doesn't work at all. All it does is just gives me the best route not the traffic conditions on that route. But all in all I really happy with it. I use it to turn on the lights my house. I use it to listen to music. And also I love it when it's reads my audiobooks for me. Also I love the feedback when you have a problem with it. Amazon gets right back to you with helpful suggestions. ",
"Sara A. Rubinson","November 27, 2016 ",5.0,"Alexia is my new BFF so far, we're getting along really well and I'm considering having her replace some of my more high maintenance friends.    However, like real humans, she does have downfalls. It says she will search for things on bing that she doesn't know, I can't figure out how to get her to do that. Also, her speaker sucks! My apartment is about 600 square feet and at the loudest I can't really hear her when I leave from the immediate vicinity (my dad has the regular echo and the sound quality is insane- there's no comparison). I just got her a friend - a Bluetooth speaker that I think will solve the problem.    She is pretty effin awesome though. I love that I can control her when I'm not home through the app, I use her mostly to play music when I'm at work for my dogs. ",
Scarlett_Kat,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my Echo-Dot (2nd Generation). I mainly bought it because I wanted a speaker to listen to music, yet I thought this would be fun to get some other information from as well. As I am getting to know &quot;Alexa&quot; I am realizing she has a lot of capabilities to play games like 20 Questions, Rock Paper Scissors, Bingo, Jeopardy 6...among many others. She has a sense of humor. She can give you news and answer questions. She is voice command and has new things Amazon adds all the time. My family really gets a kick out of her. We enjoyed it so much, my son also bought one for his room. The only draw back that I have found so far is that it doesn't have a parent control. But whatever your kids are asking it, does come up on a log so you can see what they are asking. If they say anything inappropriate you should know about it with the Alexa App. It does have an option to turn off purchasing, so your kids aren't ordering things from your account. I have had it for over a month and I am very happy with it. ",
"Kevin P Overholt","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Using in my office for now and voice recognition works perfect so far. I changed from Alexa to Amazon as I thought that sounds more natural. I find from time to time that I use the word Amazon in my conversations and I see it light up, kind of funny. I have not done much else with it yet other than ask it to play Christmas music and seeing as I have not setup Pandora or any other music I assume it defaults to Amazon prime music which is pretty nice. I have a couple Blink cameras and plan to set them up next. I also have a Vera home automation system that pretty much runs itself but from time to time when I have to enable it etc. and would be nice to have voice commands instead of getting my phone out, logging into the app and making the change. I bought the Echo Dot so I could use it with my whole house speakers but have not been able to find a way to hook up the 3.5mm external speaker jack to my four banana plugs that control my four rooms. I will post an update when I have tried these out. ",
Jeff,"January 30, 2017 ",5.0,"I have an Amazon Echo in the living room and purchased the Echo Dot for the bedroom. They both do the same thing. The Echo Dot is a little slower to respond than the Amazon Echo but other than that it works great. If both Echo's happen to hear me, only one responds. They do not interfere with each other. I use mine for controlling lighting and the thermostat and I'm very happy with the results. The audio quality of the Echo Dot is not as good and the Amazon Echo but plenty good enough for most functions. If you want to listen to music then you can always add a quality speaker. I would buy this again. ",
"G. Stapleton","December 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I use this anytime I am in the kitchen for a long period of time. My other main echo is in my bedroom. The key to this type of technology is to just use it. It's easy for one not to find a need for a product like this. Mainly because they have it on their phone, which they don't use either. I use mine for any and everything. I ask the weather before I leave work, I am constantly asking fo the time, I listen to my Spotify through it and the list goes on. I even download extra things that the echo offers through the website to add even more complexity to it.    So, buy it and use it. ",
"Bob Johnson","December 5, 2016 ",4.0,"I have been watching the Echo and reviews and when they came out with the Dot 2nd Gen for $50 I thought this was the time to try...  Boy am I glad :)    I bought a Dot and then 2 days later ordered another.  Using primarily for Amazon music, I also signed up for the Amazon Unlimited Music.  We have 1 Dot in the Kitchen with an inexpensive, but great little blue tooth speaker by Anker, and the other is connected to our Main Entertainment system and the music is just outstanding.    We are also taking advantage of the Shopping List function, perfect for adding items when you are in the kitchen.  Also integration with our Harmony Hub using IF (ifttt) and we have set up additional triggers for shopping cart notification, to send the shopping list to our phones.    Our 4 year old grandson is already asking Alexa to play kids songs he likes and is so pleased when he asks for a song and it starts playing    Overall we are extremely pleased with the Dot and plan on getting a third to put out in my workshop.    If you are tempted, then just try it :) ",
YellowBug,"March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I love it already !  It was so easy to set up with very clear and concise instructions.  I got two this year for Christmas, so I can put one by my bed and one in the den. Amazon might want to make the cord white to match the white Dot for those of us that these things matter :)  So glad I bought it !!  UPDATE:  Now that I have had this device for over two months I still like it, BUT it has yet to answer even one of my questions.  I hate the fact that Amazon decided to use BING...who thought that was a good idea ?  The fact that Alexa can not give me answers to my inquiries is enough to make me want to check out Google Home.

"Adam M","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Mostly a novelty for now but the kids love it. We must ask Alexa for 20 jokes a day and the ability to play any song is fantastic. From a practical perspective, I find new things to use it for everyday. For now, the simple timer operation is nice, simply because my hands are usually full when I'm grilling or trying to cook so this little guys makes it easy to set a timer and continue without having to stop and wash hands, etc.    The sound quality is OK and as expected for such a small device. I did buy a Bluetooth adapter so this hooked up to my Niles Audio system and it worked OK. However, I wish there was a way to pump music through the Bluetooth connection but continue to use the Alexa for questions and other stuff.However, I'll probably need another Echo to do this. Also, the sounds quality through the Bluetooth connection is OK, but nothing compared to the iPod or Sirius sound quality directly connected to the Niles unit which is far superior.    All in all, more novelty than practical. ",
Jennifer,"December 25, 2016 ",5.0,"There is not one thing I can say differently than the previous 5,000 +positive reviews left, but I had to say how much I LOVE this product! I bought 6 for Christmas gifts and am going to purchase more tonight.  I love asking Alexa to play my favorite music, ask her when the next full moon is, what the temp is, turn on BBC,, turn on Audible  or the hundreds of other things I ask her to do daily.  I am waiting for my wi-fi outlet plugs to come in to turn off lights and such as that will only increase my joy in this product!  Amazon has hit it out of the park with this item.  I thought that the Kindle was the greatest thing going (still is pretty cool), but this is it.  It is perfect for all ages.  I purchased this for my 11 year old niece and she adores it.  She uses it to help with her homework and read stories with.  She listens to music and is able to turn off her tv and lights without leaving her bed.  Don't hesitate to purchase this for everyone in your life, including yourself! ",
"Kahlos Mahn","December 5, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my Amazon Echo Dot! Got one for Christmas and was so excited to set it up! I have a Magic Home bluetooth lightbulb which works great (3 step process to set it up) easily connected my Spotify account, and added a couple of fun skills (weather, dream-machine noises, comedy central, NPR, horoscope, etc.) and use it everyday! It's most handy when I first wake up and groggily say 'Alexa stop!' and the alarm fades away, then I listen to the weather and get a flash briefing on what's new in the news while I get ready for work, maybe ask her to play a song to pep me up. Then at night I ask her to turn the lights on (though I've noticed a bit of lag from the Magic Home lighbulb, not Echo's fault, it happens with Magic Home Android app too) and am planning on getting another BT lightbulb for my overhead room-light-fixture. Overall this is a great product, the sound quality is great for such a little thing, after doing the initial voice set up, Alexa understands me even when I'm dozing off and slurring my words, asking her to turn the lights off. :) ",
Joshua,"December 16, 2016 ",5.0,"Setup was easy and straightforward. Great to be able to use voice commands for lights. It would be helpful to be able to say &#34;Turn off all of the kitchen lights&#34; without having to create a group/room called &#34;All of the Kitchen Lights.&#34;    Customization of the activation/trigger word is a must. Shouldn't have to choose from the three offered. (I'm pretty tired of the thing activating every time there's a Lexus ad on TV.)    The voice recognition at one moment shocks me with its accuracy, and at other times seems to hear something that is almost entirely unlike what was actually said.    There's no ability to play the same song/playlist/news on all Echo's simultaneously in the house. So if you're doing something that involves going from room to room, you're out of luck.    Checking for and updating the firmware should be one of the voice commands the Echo recognizes. It should also be able to identify itself to make setting multiple Echos up on a network easier.    I anticipate that many of these functional limitations will be addressed with firmware updates. ",

"Reasonable Reviewer","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"The Echo Dot  seems like a great idea. Theoretically, there are many services that you can activate using your voice alone. In practice, it is mostly a mechanism to encourage further Amazon purchases.     I now view Alexa as a surly teenager with a shopping problem.     Alexa does not understand half of what I say, and most of the time I cannot get the apps to work.    Alexa will often say &quot; I don't understand that question.&quot;  Alexa will often suggest that you buy something.     Let's be honest. Alexa is not designed to be a community service by Amazon. I get it, but there needs to be more functionality added  before this is a must-have item for the home.     On the positive side, Alexa will pair with your Bluetooth device. It took me four or five tries, but now I can stream music from another device through Alexa.    Also, I found customer service for Alexa to be sorely lacking.    There is a lot of potential here, but it has not arrived yet. ",

It was a little tricky connecting to my Wi-Fi. through  my computer and had to use my ipad instead. Once it connected, there was little else to do. I've had it two days and have asked it all kinds of things: the weather, conversion of dollars to English pounds, presidents, books, soft music. My husband asked it a high level math problem that it couldn't answer. I can live with that. I've told everyone I know about it.

BigDog1,"January 18, 2017 ",3.0,"I bought a full-sized Echo a while back, and really enjoy it.    I recently bought a couple of Echo Dots to use in other rooms.  Because the Dots have a 3.5mm speaker output jack, I bought a set of inexpensive powered PC speakers to try out with the Dot, and was quite impressed -- it makes a Dot into a poor man's full size Echo.  Cool!    So I ended up buying a 6-pack of Dots, and 6 sets of inexpensive ($10) Logitech speakers, to give out to my relatives for Christmas.  Each Dot and speaker set cost right at $50, which seems like a bargain. I know my relatives are going to enjoy these. ",
Bleewzg,"December 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I wanted to respond to the reviewer who complained that his elderly parents had only Apple products and therefore could get nothing out of using the echo. My husband is both visually and hearing impaired, and we use exclusively Apple products. However by getting free accounts which is easy to do on Pandora and TuneIn my husband is able to operate Echo and listen to a lot  of his favorite music by just speaking to this amazing box. I do find that it takes more training than I thought would be necessary. I am 80 years old and my husband is 84, and we are pretty tech savvy for her age. But so far I am giving Echo a five star rating because with a little more learning, we've enabled someone who is almost deaf and blind to enjoy listening to his favorite music again. And I am enjoying some of the fun questions and answers and also using the meditation skill and the shopping list and the alarm.

"Amazon Customer","December 26, 2016 ",5.0,"For music lovers - DO NOT agree to Alexa's suggestion for Amazon Music Unlimited unless you don't mind a monthly fee.  The Alexa voice suggested Amazon Music Unlimited, and it inquired if I wanted to subscribe. I clearly enunciated NO - twice - but it still signed me up as a member. This means there is an automatic monthly payment to them.  I was signed up for something I did not want, and then I had to look around for how to cancel it in order to not have recurring charges.  The question &#34;do you want Amazon Music Unlimited&#34; is the equivalent of a lie when one becomes enrolled by answering NO.  Marketing really means manipulating, and Amazon is a giant - globally - for this.  As always - for any product by any company - buyer beware of any way a corporation can screw you.

It's funny because it sits right in front of my monitor and if the Dominoes commercial comes on where he orders pizza from Alexa it will turn on. I'm mostly disappointed that it can't be used as a speakerphone with my mobile phone but that's my own fault for not doing the research. Big thumbs up on sound quality for music.

I was excited to be able to keep shopping lists, calendar events, and have a back up alarm clock.. WRONG...You see I am not allowed to use those features as my husband is a prime member and so my dot is required to be tied to his account, so everything I add gets posted to his settings.  I am not allowed my settings.  Mine default to whatever he set up on his account.  Also, I cannot figure out why but it cannot hear my voice.  We have tried different locations.  I have tried talking to it.  I have tried whispering.  I have tried modulating my voice to be more bass.  I have screamed at it.  About the only thing I did not try before turning it off was throwing it against the wall.  My husband is the only one that still uses his and only as a back up alarm clock.

"Norbert H. Davis","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I recently purchased an Amazon Echo Dot along with the ecobee3 wi-fi thermostat.  I was pleased with the Echo Dot and the abilities of Alexa.  While I have only had it for about 3 weeks our family has fallen in love with it.  We ask Alexa for out news, weather, and to tell us some jokes.  We also started having Alexa play us some Christmas music to get us in the Christmas spirit.    The Echo Dot was easy to setup with the house wifi and getting &#34;skills&#34; installed was simple.    We are adding more &#34;smart&#34; devices like electrical plugs and switches to take advantage of the voice control and flexibility that ha smart home provides.  The Echo Dot is small and unassuming as it does not take up a lot of space which makes it perfect for any home environment.  I plan on getting more of the Echo Dots as they are convenient and fun to use.    I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to make their home a &#34;smart&#34; home. ",
"Cade Lusk","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"While I don't use this product as often as I'd like, I'm really impressed with the Echo Dot. It does what its advertised as doing, and its a really inexpensive alternative to the most popular in home AI. However, there are some serious areas that need improving for me to be using this everyday like I imagined.    The sound is a lot clearer and louder than I would have expected from the Dot. While I don't own the original Echo, I do own several speakers of similar size that cost double what the dot costs, and the sound is greater than half of the quality. Not a whole lot of graininess or anything particularly bad to speak of. Now, you're not going to get surround sound quality out of it, but it gets the job done.    Setup was a breeze. The included instructions could be followed by a child, and the whole process took about ten minutes. The hardest thing was connecting to my WiFi, and even that was just a matter of downloading the app.    Functionally, this product is everything you'd expect. Its a responsive AI that answers questions and interacts with (some) other apps to do cool things like turn on the lights or play your favorite news. One thing to mention here is that Alexa (I had to change the wake-word to &#34;echo&#34;, Alexa is a family member's name) will just search for universal sources to do these things unless you specify otherwise (looking at TuneIn for news radio, Amazon Music for all music requests, etc). Sometimes that can be a pain, but most of the time its right on.    The &#34;Skills&#34; store is pretty flush with cool skills to &#34;teach&#34; Alexa. While I understand that there is a lot of integration with the rest of the tech community, I was a little disappointed to not see more integration with the apps I have on my (android) phone. That's always been a little bit of a short-coming with Amazon though, because they always seem to truly be the less popular Third Party in the app space.    There were a couple of things that I wish someone had thought to include in this generation.    First, you cannot control your dot through separate accounts. For example, me and my Fiance share the device at home, but we don't have just one account for the house. She has to sign in under my name in order to use the app to change settings or add skills.    Second, its really, really, REALLY inconvenient that this unit has to ALWAYS be plugged in. I understand there are some battery attachments that you can buy... but seriously. This seems like a wrong move from Amazon. The small size insinuates an ease of movement. If I go from my kitchen to my bathroom, I just want to continue hearing whatever I was listening to. Maybe I want to move the unit into the bedroom without killing the power. Either way, this seems like step back in time to an era where everything electronic needed to have disposable batteries or had to be plugged in.    Last, the voice recognition over its own volume. The Echo is advertised as having many directional microphones that are supposed to make it able to hear you from any direction and over noise. However, my experience has been mixed. If I need to communicate with the Echo while its playing, say, the news - I have to SHOUT over it to get my message across. To top that, there's a microphone &#34;remote&#34; you can buy for it but no in app functionality for the microphone I carry everywhere - my phone. Again, you can't control this thing via voice commands from your phone. Huge oversight that's probably intentional to get you to buy the remote.    This is a great little gadget that has a TON of potential. I still love using mine when I do, and I think it will be a lot nicer once I get my Smart Home setup going. However, there are still a lot of areas of improvement that I really don't see as being all that difficult to implement. 3/5, I would recommend, just not strongly at this point. ",
"Mister Gizmo","November 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I was just learning to live with my disappointment over an LG &#34;smart&#34; TV I'd bought recently that is anything but smart. In addition, it has the worst user interface I've seen since the 1980s. Fortunately, Amazon has brought out a device that works, works well, and is very intuitive. It was a little bit of a problem setting up, because the instructions are so limited, but once over that small hump, it's been fine. I'm surprised at how well it understands commands, even with so-far limited exposure to my voice to learn from.    If there's a frustration, it's mainly that the Dot (and Alexa devices in general) have a lot more potential than what's available right now. As with any new device, it takes a while for third parties to figure out what capabilities are possible, and then to spend the time and effort developing them. As just one example, I could see the Dot acting as an intercom, even a rudimentary telephone to connect Dot/Alexa users. I'm thinking particularly of elderly or handicapped people who'd like something that only requires voice commands. But I'm willing to wait. And since most of the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, the Dot's hardware should be good for a few years.    Now if Amazon would only invest a little more time to bring its Kindle browser, which has been in beta for years and years, into something that actually works. You can do it, Amazon! The Dot shows that you can be great at software if you really try. :-)    Update: I did experience one wrinkle when buying a Dot for a friend. It arrived pre-registered to me. Trying to use the normal setup for the new user didn't work. I finally realized that I had to de-register it from my account, sign out of the Alexa app (and reset the Dot), then sign in as a new registrant. This is explained in Alexa help, but it wasn't obvious at first. I don't know if it's the case, but if you buy it as a &#34;gift&#34; in the purchasing process, it &#34;may&#34; arrive unregistered, which would be good. I suspect Amazon ships them registered to streamline the setup by eliminating a couple of steps. ",
"Brian S","January 31, 2017 ",3.0,"Love it. As soon as these came out I bought one. I didn't need the nice speaker of the Echo, i just use it mostly for home automation. Ties into Samsung's Smartthings nicely.    What surprises me the most is that more often that not it understands my 3 year old son. This is both amazing and annoying as he loves to say (in a very muttled toddler voice), &#34;Alexa, turn off all the lights&#34;. To which Alexa will reply (80% of the time), &#34;OK&#34;. Every light in my house goes off... I'm not pointing this out as a negative, its quite remarkable she understands him correctly 80% of the time. The other 20% she can't understand him, but who can blame her, I can barley understand him sometimes.    We also love using this as a cooking timer, but even more so as countdown timer for bath time. It helps my son cope with playtime being over, he will even set her timer for me.    The Alexa platform is growing fast. Some things I hope to see soon:      -Text readouts and replies (for multiple people, e.g. &#34;Alexa send message to Brian from jessica's phone&#34;, even better perhaps someday she will distinguish 1 voice from another, using this as a security measure so only I can send messages from phone)    -Calendar Events    -API integration that will allow Alex to alert you to items (e.g. &#34;your front has been open for over 5 minutes&#34;, or &#34;Someone just rang your doorbell&#34;) ",
"Todd P. Hubbard","October 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I am mostly thrilled with my purchase. I am rapidly integrating Alexa into my Smart Home. However, recently it appears Alexa lost its way. When I spoke the wake name &#34;Alexa,&#34; the blue ring would appear, but after I gave the command, nothing happened. I performed the setup once again, but even then Alexa was lost. I couldn't find any tutorials on this problem. However, by the next day, Alexa had found its way and everything was back to normal. I did have to initiate contact between my Smart devices and Echo, since I had essentially rebooted the system. I am still thrilled with the software and its connection to so many useful skills. ",
"Josh Carter","February 27, 2017 ",5.0,"My biggest question before buying the Dot was whether the volume was too low to use by itself, but the volume of this device is certainly substantial enough to not need an external speaker, especially if it's being used in a location where music isn't one of the top uses. I have the full-size Echo in my kitchen/downstairs area and it fills the first floor with music most of the time. The Dot is in my bedroom and is used more for information & smart home use, but is great for the morning news briefings and occasionally playing music in the mornings while getting ready for the day. ",
Tortionist,"March 8, 2017 ",4.0,"This little gem is worth every penny. I researched this device and watched a lot of YouTube videos on it before I decided to buy it. The set up is easy and it has pretty decent sound for such a small device. After all the research, I came to the conclusion that the only difference between this and the regular sized echo is the sound quality. The regular Amazon Echo gets better and louder sound. I look forward to purchasing it soon. My kids and I have had fun with it telling jokes. I would say that about 75% of the jokes are actually pretty funny and make me laugh. If you ask Alexa why she sucks she has a funny response in saying that maybe she thought she was a vacuum cleaner. We use it for Music, mainly Pandora, weather, jokes, etc. I'm getting ready to dig deeper and see what else is possible. ",
batonrouge,"November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly I still use my echo more than this one.  But that is mainly due to the location of both units. I still have difficulty getting wink and some other skills to add and perform like others say it should be able to. I'm usually pretty good at learning and using electronics but I find I still have some issues. I often find myself having to repeat myself to get its attention.  And if you don't say the trigger phrase just right you are just waiting your breath and look like a idiot in front of others yelling at it and either it not hear you or it performs something other than what your telling it.  But I do believe that this is only the beginning of great things to come. It broke a barrier and is just the beginning of a new trend in technology.  And because of the price, I rated it 4 stars rather than 3.  I will say that im glad I didn't buy one for each room. There will be something even better worth doing that soon enough.  Just wait a little while and you will see. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 7, 2017 ",5.0,"I purchased this as a replacement for an IVR clock called &#34;Moshi&#34;. Moshi's Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) was contained in the clock and was not trainable. The Echo Dot cost the same as the clock. The Echo Dot's &#34;Alexa&#34; IVR program has many features that make it superior. First, the IVR itself is trainable and vastly superior to the clock. She correctly understands almost everything I say. This is because Alexa lives in the Amazon Cloud, and is connected via Wi-Fi. She picks up the correct Time & Date from the network so you never have to set any of those things. She will also read you the current news and weather. You will need a smartphone to use Echo Dot. The phone must be connected to Wi-Fi and then the Alexa app must be installed and run. You must have an Amazon account. Alexa will also play music, and will evolve over time as new functionality is added. I should note that Alexa is an IVR program, NOT an AI. ",
RailJoe,"November 10, 2016 ",4.0,"You know I really thought this was going to be fun as a novelty and maybe I would use Alexa occasionally; but I am Amazed at the stuff Alexa can do. I am a bit of a geek when it comes to new tech. but I as I look back at what verbal recognition used to entail. Hours of training the computer to understand your voice ( your voice alone) and  how to understand your particular voice nuances. Wow, where we are today, Alexa understanding  multiple people and here is my favorite, Alexa singing a song, a Song. Unbelievable. The future of technology is upon us. My daughter asked for an Echo Dot for herself as a Christmas gift. Talking to my relatives during dinner and each of them had a Dot or knew someone who owned one. Each of us; varying in ages, are all amazed at where Alexa is today. Where Alexa will be tomorrow , Can not Wait. By the way she is helping me spell some of the words I have questions about their spelling. Fantastic. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This is a very good product. I primarily use it as an alarm clock to wake me and as a timer, but this goes WAY past that. I enjoy how you can listen to music if you have Prime and how you can control what is playing on your phone. One of my favorite features is that you have to use your brain to make Alexa say something fun- ask her for an Easter egg.    I only have two criticism: one, with Apples Siri, if she misunderstood what you said you can correct that. In the Alexa app, you can only select if she heard you right- not what you really said. I would like that feature to be added. Secondly, Alexa should be able to hear you from further away. Apparently there is a far-field voice regognition feature but it only seems to works about half the time. If you could improve that, Amazon, that would be great.    Other than those two things, I would highly recommend this to anyone. Alexa fits in perfectly to my life. ",
"Tara Gentile","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"She knows when you've been bad or good, so watch your back. I've had her in my home and have given her as a gift to several people. Honestly ... she scares the bejesus out of me. We do not speak her name out loud for fear that she will kill us ... unless we want to know the weather forecast. We refer to her as &#34;hockey puck&#34; when speaking as not to disturb her. I fear that she is hypnotizing my pets when I am at work so that they will worship the flagship of Amazon.  I think she convinced my one-eyed cat to order catnip at a deeply discounted rate ... which in turn, is why he is currently in rehab.  A five pound bag of mealworms showed up at my house the other day - darn you evil bluebirds in my yard who have infiltrated my acccount. Do you know how big a bag of 5 lbs meal worms is?! They needed a forklift to unload it! Thank goodness I have Prime for free shipping! Hockey Puck, stop looking at me while I type this! ",
Chris,"January 18, 2017 ",5.0,"I was a little skeptical when my wife bought this for me, as Siri has driven me to multiple expletives on numerous occasions.  But this is a great product and incredibly impressed with what it understands, picks up, and is able to understand even with significant background noise or other people talking. Was able to find a skill with my local news station for morning news and having a great time with all it can do.  Absolutely love the convenience of ordering off your prime account, all I had to do is say, &#34;Order water filters for my LG refrigerator&#34; and they were at my doorstep 3 days later!  I found out it has a calculator function when I walked in the room and my 3rd grader was asking Alexa the answers to his math homework (side note, Alexa got a 100% on that assignment).  Very convenient that you can add family members to the App so if you have multiple people on your prime account you can tie them in as well. ",

I have always been able to get up again, but if one day I can't, I can ask Alexa to alert one or all of the contacts I put into Ask My Buddy. Your contact(s) will be alerted by phone and by text that you need assistance. The service is free, but you can make a donation. ",
"Shelly Rae","March 9, 2017 ",3.0,"I bought this for my Husband for Christmas.  My husband likes Alexa a lot.... but I find her annoying, mostly because out of the blue she will start talking or say &#34;I didn't get that' or &#34;I didn't understand the question&#34;... when there was no question at all.  Most of the time she talks we weren't even talking.  Maybe we aren't maximizing her features but other than getting the weather report or the headline news I haven't seen too much value.  We did buy the light kits that work with Alexa but the brand just couldn't keep connected to our internet so we had to return them.  When they were working we found the light feature handy, but when Alexia isn't connected to anything, she's just another gadget I don't need on my counter.  Until she can cook dinner for me, she's really not that useful in my eyes... but she does talk to my husband, tell him jokes, and answers his questions, so maybe she'll grow on me. ",

Numidian,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I recently bought a full sized Echo and liked it, but I have a bluetooth enabled receiver and in-ceiling wired speakers so I didn't need the speaker. Naturally, I jumped at the new Echo Dot. Overall, the experience is great - but it does have a few strengths and weaknesses worth mentioning. Below I will only discuss things directly related to the Dot as the Echo's features, strengths and weaknesses have been discussed ad nauseam.    PROS:  -Small: this thing is literally the size of a hockey puck. It is way less obtrusive than the the original Echo and doesn't seem like just another hunk of plastic.  -Bluetooth connectivity: I was skeptical about the bluetooth here because I always seem to have problems getting headphones and speakers to reliability connect to devices via bluetooth. The Echo Dot was super easy to pair with my Sony Receiver (https://www.amazon.com/Sony-STR-DN840-Channel-1050-Watt-Receiver/dp/B00CAAQHBE). All I have to say is &#34;Alexa, connect to bluetooth speaker&#34; and my receiver wakes up, connects to the Echo and starts playing music - or whatever is coming from the Echo. So far I have been able to connect this way with 100% reliability.  -Feature to price ratio: the Dot is 62% less than the original Echo and has all the features minus the bigger speaker. If you have your own bluetooth speaker or receiver, this is a non-issue. This is also a no-brainer purchase if you want an echo.    CONS:  -Microphones: we have noticed that the Echo Dot doesn't hear our commands as often or as well compared the original Echo. We sometimes have to shout our commands to the Echo after it seems to have ignored us at a regular volume. Some of this may be that the Dot has a harder time isolating our voices from the noise of the external speakers. We have also noticed that Echo doesn't seem to understand what we tell it with more frequency than the original Echo.  -Random responses: occasionally we noticed that the Dot will respond completely out of the blue to something. It doesn't have anything to do with what we are saying - I am not sure if it's picking something up from our speakers or what. It is just a bit creepy when it suddenly pops in with a random statement.  -Bluetooth limits: though I mentioned the bluetooth connectivity is excellent, it is worth noting that only one device can be connected at a time (not a big deal and a limit for all bluetooth devises) but the interesting thing I didn't think about is you can't transmit, let's say a podcast, to the Echo via bluetooth from another device and have it play that podcast to your bluetooth speakers. Thus, the Echo Dot can only play content directly from the internet when connected to bluetooth speakers. Again, this is a limit with any bluetooth device, but it is something I hadn't thought about until I wanted to play something from my iPhone on the speakers - just had to connect directly to my receiver in that case.

"Cheryl D.","April 19, 2017 ",5.0,"It's an overall interesting device, but I'm not terribly thrilled with Alexa. Most of the questions I asked it couldn't be answered, even though they were somewhat basic. For example, try asking it to set your zip code -- it can't do that. You'd figure something like this would be able to, but instead you have to go into the settings app for this and other things. There are other questions as well where it fails to understand what you're asking in ways that Google Now on Android phones seems to have no problems understanding. This might have been a better product if Google hadn't already set a higher expectation of what a voice assistant should be able to do. ",

She doesn't seem to be as sharp as other digital assistants but she knows enough and understands speech well. I love that you can buy other things to be connected with her. We got a plug so we can tell her to turn our bedroom light off and on which is very convenient. Well worth the money! ",

We purchased it after we went to a friend's house and they had just installed the full sized Echo. We were impressed. Usually, when we want to listen to music, I have to hook my ipod up to a speaker. However, I have an ipod classic, which does not have bluetooth. That means that I have to find a speaker cable as well, and both units are moved around together. With the Dot I can just leave it on the shelf, connect it to my blutooth speaker, and move the speaker as needed. We have an open floor plan, so most of the time we don't have to move the speaker, but if we are in the kitchen we sometimes can not hear the music as well, so we just move the speaker now.  I am still learning about all of the things the Dot can do, and it is fun to find these things. ",
chbaileyOR,"April 23, 2017 ",4.0,"My recommendation is to make sure you are prepared to use the Dot wherever you do not require much volume.  Perfect for low volume settings, but not anywhere where you would require additional volume to hear it.    I really like the Echo (large model). I have a Tap and have used the Echo previously.  I like both those models for different reasons, though the only real reason to purchase a Tap is the portability.  Otherwise, go with the Echo.  So since I had a Tap, but wanted the Echo features, I bought an Echo Dot.  This is where you might end up in a conundrum.  I want more sound, and the Dot does not provide much.  I use it in the kitchen, where I listen to NPR and use the timer while cooking.  The problem is when there is any noise in the room, the Dot is simply not loud enough to be heard.  I originally had the Tap in the kitchen, but wanted the voice control of the Dot.    First world problems... ",
Reaxions,"December 12, 2016 ",5.0,"Easy setup, and able to understand and execute everything I say. I primarily use it as voice control for a dedicated theater, so I've integrated it with my Logitech Harmony Remote and Home Hub, Philips Hue lights, Samsung SmartThings Hub, etc., and it all works perfectly together. The other functionality, like the alarm clock, timer, search engine, etc. is all more of a novelty to me, but it's still great to have, and it entertains the hell out of my 4-year-old son. For the price, this is one of the best purchases I've made in years, and it's very quickly become indispensable in my house. I wish there was a way to make it only listen/respond to my voice, as I don't want anyone else playing with my theater setup, but hopefully unique voice recognition (and added security features) will come with later models. For the time being, that one extremely minor shortcoming is easily overlooked by everything else it provides. ",
amazonian,"December 2, 2016 ",4.0,"Received the Dot with TP Link smartplug bundle last week. Dot works great with its Alexa app, love it. TP smartplug works great with its Kasa app. But to be able to tell Alexa to turn off lights etc, Alexa needs to enable Kasa within the Alexa app, WHICH SHE SIMPLY WILL NOT DO for me, and from reading reviews, for other people as well. Alexa app reads &#34;Unable to link, try again later&#34; and there's no troubleshooting for that from any source, Alexa or Kasa. The Help-Support links within Alexa app are disabled so I'm left scrolling through reviews looking for advice. Followed every step so it's odd it's not linking. The smartplug integration option was a key point for me so unless this feature works with the Dot, half the appeal of the device is gone. Just know that this may happen to you if you're considering buying the bundle. Amazon, please add some Alexa troubleshooting support for this type of issue. ",
Maria,"November 30, 2016 ",5.0,"For the price it is not a bad unit. My only complaint is the speaker, the quality is clearly inferior to the amazon echo ( which we expected for the price) but I did not expect it to be that bad when it came to music or even the voice of alexa. It does its job though it works in the bedroom while alexa is in the living room.    It still has the same features, home automation, Pandora, shopping list, weathers etc.... the only problem for me is just the speaker quality. If you want it not for music just for the other features this is the perfect unit especially for the price !    If you are like me and do not have a sound system to connect the dot to then using this for music even in a small space may not be the best option just due to the lack of quality especially compared to the echo.    Would I purchase another one, probably not but would I recommend it  to someone looking for an amazon echo but does not want to spend the money 100% yes. ",
"darcy madison","December 4, 2016 ",3.0,"Stupid....limited in what it can do.

"Alfredo Jahn","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Only been using it for a few hours. Love it so far. I got it primarily to control my TP-Link wi-fi smart plug for my living room lamp. The only issue I'm having is, I can't hear Alexa when I plug it into my home stereo. The music sounds ok (seems a little out of phase, maybe it has to do with the streaming from Amazon Prime). So if I connect to my receiver to listen to music, then ask Alexa what the weather is, I can hardly hear her response. I tried to set it back to use the internal speaker, but couldn't figure out how to do that. I ended up unplugging it from the stereo, and now i can hear it from the internal speaker. But the music isn't really worth listening to from the tiny speaker. I hope I can resolve this issue. But for home automation and asking simple questions, it is fantastic! ",
"C. Goetsch","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"very good product although my husband is driving me nuts by asking Alexa to play random songs all the time. love the flash feature and that you can connect it to your calendar, also the timer is great as my kids are always wondering off with my kitchen timer so nowi dont have to go hunting for it i can just say Alexa set timer for ???    Very useful and fun device. we already ordered 2 more,  one for our bedroom and one for a gift.

Jeni,"April 4, 2017 ",4.0,"My mother is in a long term care facility and has been asking me for a cassette player to play all her wonderful collection of music.  She literally has thousands of old cassettes.  She no longer has the ability to push buttons or understand how to operate a CD or cassette player, but boy can she tell Alexa what she wants!  This has opened up a whole world for her.  It helps her mentally to formulate a command and it gives her back the joy of music and Audible books.  I've got her signed up for Amazon Music Unlimited, etc.  It's just a God send. ",
lacey29,"November 29, 2016 ",5.0,"Very amazing little machine - my kids love it. I got two of these as Christmas gifts - one for my daughter and one for my nephew. They are both very happy with them. They love the idea of asking Alexa to tell a joke, give them a weather report, and most importantly to play their favorite songs. We have linked the Echo Dot to Spotify and Pandora, along with Amazon music and they can find all their songs in an instant. It is especially nice for my daughter who is in 2nd grade and isn't quite at the point of being able to search online for songs herself. She can just ask Alexa to find a song and she is surprisingly accurate. Overall, this is a great product at a very reasonable price.  I found the Dot to be surprisingly loud on its own, but I did hook it up to a cheap portable speaker for my daughter to use when she is in the shower since it wasn't quite loud enough independently.

"Michelle L. Sullivan","April 20, 2017 ",5.0,"I seriously love this thing!  I use it mostly for music and other info such as news and weather. It has made my music listening experience so much better being able to verbally request music I want to hear, skip songs easily and also change the volume all without lifting a finger.  I even used it the other day when I was cooking to find out appropriate cooking temps for pork.  Loved that I didn't have to stop what I was doing to get the info I needed.  It is a super easy system to set up and I have yet to be disappointed.  It did take me a few tries to figure out how to ask for specific things such as getting to my playlists but once you figure it out there are no issues.  And if you can't remember what you said to get there, you can always go to the Alexa app and see it there.  I have it bluetoothed to my Bose system so the sound is great.  This is now my go to gift for the holidays. ",
HereRightNow,"January 31, 2017 ",5.0,"This is a nifty device that has many great features and is sometimes even more convenient that pulling out my phone to check something (which I didn't think was possible. I love the ability to get an assortment of music right at the sound of my voice, and also the Jeopardy! feature is a personal favorite that I play every morning. It's also very loud for a very small device (as much so as my large Bluetooth speaker). My own two sticking points that caused me to dock a star were the lack of portability (I thought you charged the device and took it anywhere, not have to leave it attached to the wall), and the particularness that it has when connecting with WiFi. I bought this for myself at college right after we upgraded our school-sponsored WiFi, but I ended up having to find another connection because the Echo Dot doesn't link up to encrypted WiFi, or even show it on the screen.

Everyday it's &#34;Alexa turn on the lights&#34; then she thinks for a minute and nothing happens, so then I say it again and by then it usually works. This happens with many things and the problem is absolutely with the echo and not the smart lights because most of the time the echo never responds. Hopefully amazon will make this product better, right now it seems to have quite a few glitches. ",
autumn,"April 20, 2017 ",4.0,"My kids like the echo dot.  It plays music, answers questions about the weather, and does addition/subtraction etc..

It also takes a little long for echo dot to answer questions.  I understand that it is impossible to answer all questions, but I expect echo dot will be able to answer a lot more than what it currently does.  At least, the programmers should collect the type of questions echo dot is not able to answer and then add more facts to their knowledge base.  Also, I am not sure why cannot echo dot parse information obtained through search engine (echo dot uses bing) to answer questions ",
SD,"March 1, 2017 ",2.0,"So many others have talked about how they use this product, you can find those reviews below.  Great youtube videos, too. I had no idea the product was so useful.  Here is one small thing no one talks about.  Alexa has &#34;cards&#34;, which tell you which requests were made and even leaves a recording of the request. The purpose is to keep track of whether &#34;Alexa&#34; accurately answered your request.  There were cards for things I knew I had never asked for.  Playing the request is how I foiund out that my nephew was asking for music, when I was away from home, that I wouldn't let him play while around.  HA!  You should have seen his eyes, too funny. Yes, it is  a little &#34;big brother&#34; at times, but great for keeping track of what your kids ask for when no one is looking. ;)  I bought the echo, loved it so much I purchased a multi-pack of dots to give to family for the holidays.

Dinnerplate,"April 2, 2017 ",3.0,"Alexa is pretty useless for the most part. She is good at telling me what time it is, setting a timer while cooking or an alarm. Half the time for music she doesn't know what you are asking for so its easier to just use my phone on a speaker. If you are buying the Dot because you want good sound quality through an external system its awful as well. For alexa to respond the system needs to be on, so you end up pluging and unpluging her from whatever.    She also uses bing for search which is literally the worst thing ever.    I also bought this to allow me to control caseta lights, which worked for about a month. Now alexa either tells me that the device doesn't support being turned off/on or that it didn't respond in time, as the lights do what I asked.    I'm going to try google home, it looks way more promising :/ ",
"Ashley B.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Great! Can do what the bigger one does (or so I hear) and we don't have any issues with the speaker being too quiet/not quality enough for what we're using it for. We use it for a variety of things but in a house with a 3-year old it is most often used as a kitchen, potty, or time-out timer- lol. We got it as a gift so I wouldn't have bought it myself just for that, but having a newborn on my hands it is so nice just to tell &#34;Alexa&#34; to play a song or start a timer for me. I'm sure with more time I will continue to learn how better to use the capabilities for further use. ",
"Carolyn A. Russell","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"We bought this device primarily for my 6 year-olds birthday because right now he's anxious about various animals and has been asking non-stop questions about them that I can't answer (and frankly, am really tired of trying to answer!). It did fine at playing music for us (which was the other feature we were looking to) but was very disappointing in terms of answering questions. It was unable to recognize my son's questions, and even when my husband and I asked, it said it didn't know the answer to almost everything we asked (it could tell us what whales and snakes ate. It couldn't answer questions about specific snakes and what they ate, it couldn't answer ANY questions about what sharks eat or if they eat people) and even the answers we DID get weren't all that detailed or specific (&#34;whales eat fish&#34;). This might be a great option for other people, but in terms of strictly answering questions and being informative, we were seriously let down. ",

I ask Alexa a ton of questions. I love the games she will play and stories she tells. My only complaint is that Alexa needs more personality, like the Google Home unit has (my folks have that one so I get to play with both). Other than that, the Echo rocks. I have it hooked up to my Smart Home system which allows me to use voice commands on certain functions of my house, which is totally awesome. ",
Friday,"January 22, 2017 ",3.0,"It is a fun little gadget.

The &#34;skills&#34; that you can add are very useful, I like the Twitter skill that can read me the latest tweets.  Alas, you can't compose tweets through this device. Also quite useful is the companion app for my Iphone.  When I ask the Echo Dot for some information that is a bit wordy (like &#34;how to cook a turkey&#34; ) it send that info to the Iphone. The alarm feature is useful but I am disappointed that it will not audibly alert you to any reminders .  I was able to link this device to Google Calendar and find that very helpful.

It turn on randomly, waking me up in the morning even. it is highly inaccurate in comparison to the Echo - Alexa misunderstands me. she's like a gf who just, after we got so comfortable, changed. She's wrong more than half the time. But maybe that all is user error - misplacement of the dot who knows. but technical errors like disconnecting from wifi are just unforgivable. The amazon echo never had that issue. the echo dot has poor volume. I can't even hear it all full blast from the other side of the 10x10 room when listening to the news. I have to say - dont buy the echo dot unless you are in a small bedroom and can put up with the constant wifi dropping. ",
Judy,"March 22, 2017 ",4.0,"How did I ever survive without Alexa? Haha this is great! I love having voice control over most things in my master bedroom. I use it with my speaker for music, and with a WeMo switch for my 2 lamps bedside.It was cheaper than buying the smart bulbs. The Echo Dot works just as described. I use it to set alarms, play music, voice volume control,  tell me jokes, & more, pretty soon I plan to voice order form amazon. I don't watch much tv or I'd invest in a smart remote and voice control that too! The set up was simple. I followed the little instruction card and was done within a couple minutes. VERY EASY, just plug it in, wait for the orange light, push one button & that's it! Alexa greets you. You can change the the code word to whatever you want. I like Alexa for now. When I get bored with it, I'll mix it up a little. Definitely recommend, get it, you'll love it. ",
Aerlpam,"January 16, 2017 ",2.0,"Received this right after Thanksgiving and have only scratched the surface as far as the Echo Dots capabilities.  Waking up during the night and asking Alexa for the time is neat and getting the weather first thing in the morning only makes me want to see what else I can do with this little wonder.  Glad I waited on the Dot vs buying the other Echo products.  Can see me buying one or two more Dots in the future to provide full household coverage.  Will probably wait awhile before adding any of the many 'works with Alexa' products coming onto the marketplace.  Find the sound of the Dot more than acceptable for most uses and casual listening to music.  One of my better recent purchases and certainly will be a great Christmas gift for the techie in the house.  Saying that, I think there will be more than a few Moms and Dads using the Dot once they experience how easy it is to use. ",
"Jessie J","December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"After all the hype I got one. I couldn't get it to work properly.  I was successful in getting it synched to the wifi once, just long enough for me to ask Alexa to tell us the weather. No, my service wasn't the issue, I connected several other devices to make sure.  I even did all the resets, made sure nothing else was connected to the wifi, etc., it just wasn't working out.    Then recently I'm reading all these reports about Alexa ordering $140 doll houses, and $162 of Christmas cookies for kids. And the cops wanting to review the recordings from a crime.  Ok, the doll house and cookies can be returned. Recording and helping with a crime - that's awesome!  BUT, what else is it recording.  I don't really care to have my private life come under possible scrutiny over Alexa.    I love technology, but this one just ain't gonna cut it for my house. ",
Edwin,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Man, I don't know what life was like before we got Alexa.  She makes our life easy.  She turns on and off all of our lights, our furnace, air conditioner, she even sets and changes the mood lights in our bedroom.  She is now my alarm clock, she plays music, and I used her a lot for new words as my talking dictionary.    Remember the days where you have to turn on your computer and Google something?  Well, now you can ask Alexa even if you just woke up from your bed like as her &#34;Alexa, what time is it?&#34;  You can even set an alarm for Alexa to wake you up in half an hour, or even play your favorite music.  I think what I like most about Alexa is that she has made my life that much easier especially when my hands are tied and I don't have a set of hands to turn on the lights, she can do that for me with a &#34;say a command!&#34;  I highly recommend you get one and once you do, you don't look back!!

McDade,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This is a cool little device. The sound quality when connected to my home stereo via the 3.5mm plug is surprisingly clear and balanced. My only critiques are:    - When a 3.5mm plug is inserted, the Dot's internal speaker is disabled. You then have two options: turn your stereo on or unplug from the jack. Neither of these are satisfactory because they require something manual which negates the purpose of this device. You should be able to verbally tell Alexa to disable 3.5mm jack which would enable the internal speaker. It's kind of silly to have to turn my stereo on just to hear the forecast.    - Alexa is not very good at doing Google-esque searches. It falls way behind Siri in that regard.    It's a good start but needs some more work to achieve it's true potential. I got it as a gift so I can't complain but maybe ver3 will address some of these obvious shortfalls. ",
Phoenecian,"February 1, 2017 ",5.0,"This is awesome. Growing pains aside, with app development and smart tech integration issues, this thing is great.

I imagine I am source of most product integration issues, as I learn to interact more efficiently with ALEXA. Music is worth the monthly fee, and occasionally I have speech request issues, and sometimes, its perfect every time. Next up will be landscape lighting, and house HVAC wifi vent registers, and eventually I want to integrate some form of video control through firestick, or Roku boxes.

"Brian Hankins","December 8, 2016 ",3.0,"Works as well as my Echo with a small positioning caveat.    Pros: Internal speaker is actually pretty good, just as others have said. I could use it by itself in most rooms where I mostly wanted to ask it things. Seemed to respond from across decent sized room of about 15'. Easily connects to Bluetooth speakers and the auxiliary cabled speakers.    Cons: If you connect it to a speaker and it is sitting  even a bit behind the speaker it seems to have trouble hearing you when something is playing. The best setup seemed to be Echo Dot on one end of the room and the speakers on the other side of the room. Actually those were the only two setups I tried but it responded to everything I threw at it in the latter scenario.    I plan to get more for my important rooms since I have smart home stuff hooked to them now, They need to make an outdoor one that looks like a flower pot or something for my porch. ",

I loved that it controlled the Christmas lights too. I was so impressed that I came back online and ordered another one for myself. I can't wait to start connecting my house too.    I currently use it to give me the weather and news reports every morning, play music, set timers, alarms and reminders. It took about an hour to setup but the Amazon Alexa app walked me through the process pretty easily once I downloaded it on my iphone.

Shutterbug35,"March 27, 2017 ",5.0,"We had the Google home and I ordered the Amazon Echo dot to compare. Of course the Google  product is more comparable to the upper end Amazon offering (Echo) rather than the Dot which is meant to be sprinkled around the house and lying in wait for questions. The ability to detect and interpret my accent was a little better with the Google home. Google also had more responsive answers. Still experimenting with the Dot. Its ability to recognize being called (&#34;Alexa!&#34;) is wonderful, especially when a roomful of conversations are in progress. The price is to kill for and the technology packed into it is phenomenal. Even if you were to buy a talking clock, thermometer, weather gauge and a general knowledge question-answer generator as well as a joke teller, a quiz creator, this product at $39.99 provide more value than you can ever imagine!

It would've been nice to have an AUX cord come with the devices as its kinda necessary for the product to sound good but also its kind of expected for you to hook it up to another speaker to, so that lost a few points for me, but over all its an excellent product and I would recommend it for everyone.

So far though she's been great at letting me know the weather, traffic conditions for my work commute, updates on my favorite sports teams, and of course playing music.

The suggestion in their last message seems to have worked (resetting it to the original factory settings).  The problem has not occurred again over the last 3 days.  Here's hoping. ",

Greatly lacking in the information department.  You'll learn not to ask it general question because the response will be &#34;I can't find the answer to the question you ask&#34; or &#34;I don't...I can't...I'm not able&#34;.

I'm getting another one for out on the patio!!  nicer sound than my other sources!!  I like this for the Music and information available!!! ",
Andrew,"April 23, 2017 ",3.0,"This device is amazing, and I only have one complaint, and that is that if you ask this a simple question (ex: &quot;When was the first Mackintosh released?&quot;) Alexa will not give you the answer, but instead send you a Bing results link in the Alexa app. Other than that I love it! I would recommend this device to anybody. It's great waking up to a virtual assistant, and being able to turn on my lights and give me info, and what's happening. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 28, 2017 ",5.0,"I love my All-New Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black ... I use it in my bathroom to play my Amazon Steaming Music.

"John Grieggs","January 17, 2017 ",5.0,"Echo Dot is fairly cool when it works.  When it decides not to work, which seems rather random, it does it quietly, and you lose all control.  For example, right now, both of my Dots, in different rooms, light up and are clearly hearing me talk, but refuse to provide time, weather, or control over my alarms.  No error, just no working.  I've tried rebooting.  I can't tell what is wrong.  This is unacceptable for devices that are meant to control various facets of my house.  An Alexa device should never fail silently - it should either work, or tell me that it isn't going to work, preferably with some sort of descriptive error and estimate of when or how it might be fixed.  My internet connection and other devices are working fine - it isn't a connectivity issue.  I would NOT trust an Alexa device with anything important at this point.  If I can't trust it to tell me what time it is, why would I trust it to control my door locks, cameras, or thermostat?  I didn't give it a bottom rating but it is fairly cool when it works, but the unreliability and lack of error reporting make it a product I will not be recommending to my friends.  I do not trust it to wake me up in the morning, as it should based on my existing daily alarm, and am extremely annoyed that it will not allow me to adjust that alarm nor provide me with any status as to why that might be.

Boy was I ever wrong about that!  This little thing is so good it makes you wonder how you got along without it,  My wife scowled when she first saw it because she thought it was just another gadget as well.  Now she is crazy about it and wants one for every room in the house.  Well worth every penny it cost and it has so many uses. Things I used to have to type in on my computer to check things like the weather, she provides by simply asking.  Now my wife and I are getting older and tend to forget a few things, but by asking Alexia to add it to one of our list, we no longer miss out.  I highly recommend this little jewel because I have had mine for three months and I am still finding ne uses for it. ",

I have all my music just a simple voice command away, and I dig that.

BrianMac,"April 23, 2017 ",5.0,"Its difficult for me to give an Amazon product a negative review because I am such a big fan of Amazon but I purchased two of these, one for myself and one for my parents. My parents still have theirs and use it sparingly. I sent mine back. The biggest disappointment for me was that we hoped it would be more or less a &#34;Hey Google&#34; type device in that we could ask it questions and get answers. Unfortunately, it only answers certain types of questions. That being said, we currently not Amazon Prime subscribers and it may well function better if you are. Also, we do mot have a &#34;smart home&#34; so we were not attempting to access that functionality. May parents basically utilize it as a weather radio as they are not Amazon Prime members either. If you are not a Prime member, it requires you to set up a utilize other  apps in order to complete any tasks. ",
"Jessica L. Bennett","October 25, 2016 ",4.0,"I've loved my Echo for a while now, but my husband noticed I would move it around the house to listen to Pandora so he bought me the Dot for Christmas.  My only complaint (that's not a real complaint) is it might be too sensitive because sometimes I set the Echo and the Dot off at the same time and they answer me in surround sound.  If you have an Echo, I highly recommend adding on a Dot or two depending on the size of your house.  I use mine for random stuff all the time like asking about the time or the weather. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 16, 2016 ",3.0,"I like the Echo Dot.  I already had a Bose speaker to hook it up to so I didn't need the full Echo.  It is useful to ask questions about the weather or to turn on our hue lights and other lights hooked up to our WeMo plugs.  I only give it 4 stars because Amazon needs to improve the number of &#34;skills&#34; it has and to partner with more home automation companies like Sonos.  Its ability to interact with Nest and our separate Honeywell Wifi thermostat are limited at best.  Also the AI could use some tweaking... like this morning I kept asking about how windy it was going to be or what the projected wind speed would for the day (it was supposed to be very windy) and Alexa kept just telling me the forecast over and over.  Obviously she understands I am asking about the weather (&#34;wind&#34; apparently = &#34;weather&#34; to her) but does not understand that I am asking particular information.  Other times she will directly respond like when I asked specifically if there was any snow in the forecast.  If she can't answer it that's fine, but she should say so instead of just repeating the same answer.    Again, its a work in progress and I am sure it will get better as time does on.  I would recommend you do your research and figure out the home automation products that appear to work best with Alexa/Echo before you pull the trigger. ",
"Aaron Thompson","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"The voice recognition ability is amazing, and the Amazon Echo team is constantly improving things behind the scenes. Alexa's voice is very pleasant and easy to understand, despite the size of the Dot. Sound quality can easily be improved through the 1/8&#34; stereo jack or by pairing with Bluetooth devices. The light ring is a great way to confirm you were heard. From a kid who grew up with Speak & Spell, the Echo Dot definitely shows how far technology has come. Definitely recommended to any techie out there. $50? What are you waiting for? ",
"Tyler Forge","December 16, 2016 ",4.0,"Hey - its and Echo Dot. Yay!    I was an early adopter f the full size Echo and wanted the same capability in more rooms of the house. This dot works pretty good and does most of what I want. To be clear - this is a fantastic device at a great price.    Here is what you -won't- get.    It ain't loud. The full size echo can wake the dead. The dot, even at its loudest, can be easily drowned out by the TV. Sure, you can pair a bluetooth speaker to it, but why? If you need the volume, just get the full size echo and be done with it.    It doesn't share tasks with the other Echo. If I want a timer or alarm to sound from both, I have to tell them both. Then I have to tell them both to shut up. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Dunno.    Regardless, Alexa will change you life. Jump in. ",
"T. Sheridan","March 24, 2017 ",5.0,"I liked my tap, now I love the dot. I have the tap in my office because I am always on conference calls, I didn't want it to have any &#34;false alarms.&#34; I added the Dot to the family room and use it most often to control the lights, thermostat, and other devices around the house. It's also useful for random questions while watching movies, such as bios on actors or &#34;Is so-and-so dead or alive?&#34;  The voice recognition is very good, but you do need to practice a bit to be understood consistently.

Just make sure that you don't have it read a story with a character named Alexa or Alexis. That can have amusing results.    I also use it to make shopping lists and convert weights and measurements. It will also play radio stations and give the weather. ",
Mag,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I love this Echo - I enjoy ordering Alexa around (lol).  Primarily, I got it for weather reports locally, but have found lots of other things to ask her.  I have made &#34;to do&#34; lists, &#34;shopping&#34; lists, and I stream radio through it - much easier than setting up my laptop to find a station.  I also like to tell her to go to my Pandora account to play my songs and playlists - really cool.  I tell her to raise or lower the volume when I'm listening to radio sometimes, or I just yell, &#34;Alexa, stop!&#34; when I want her off and the tv on - without getting up from my chair..  I want to order a second Echo so I can have one in both bedrooms.  Right now, I just move the unit to different rooms, but that's getting old.  Having one in both bedrooms and one in the great room would be perfect.  I will soon. ",
DTG3,"February 15, 2017 ",5.0,"Had an echo, and used it in my bedroom for ambiance and as an alarm clock and for audiobooks occasionally.  I didn't like moving it back and forth from the living room when I had guests over (where it gets a lot of use and attention), so I purchased this so I wouldn't have to move it and so that I wouldn't have to give up on an alarm clock in the bedroom.    So now my echo dot sits by the bed.  I don't have the same bass that I have with the full-sized echo, but that's alright. This thing does what it does well and is great for audiobooks and ambient music, but would probably fall short if you're a big audiophile. For the cost of a mid-high range alarm clock, I've got that functionality and an assistant to tell me the weather and play music while I'm getting out of bed in the morning, and I still have my echo in the living room for parties, music while we cook/play board games, and what else have you.

"Craig C.","February 8, 2017 ",5.0,"Originally gave the Echo Dot only 3 stars.  I have to change it to 5 stars after I've used it for a couple of months.  After learning how much information and versatility that's packed into this product I find myself using it everyday -- and after pairing it with a decent Bluetooth speaker, the sound is fantastic.  This one is located in our bathroom, and our full size Echo is located in our kitchen.  Will probably purchase another one for the garage.    This purchase along with Amazon Prime takes care of all your musical needs, along with sports, news, and weather -- and you can also order a pizza.  Very impressive product and a great value for around $40. ",
"Tech Guy from IL","January 21, 2017 ",5.0,"This is really an amazing gadget and I'm finding a lot of good uses for mine. In the bedroom it is handy because you can ask Alexa the time or the weather at any time of the night without having to get out of bed or turn on a light. It also plays a wide variety of music. I use it to stream classical music from my favorite classical station. The sound is actually pretty good (in mono) right out of the disc if you are listening at low levels in a quiet room or at your desk at the office. Plug in a good pair of headphones and you'll get great sound in stereo. Sometimes I connect it to my stereo system and listen that way. With the dearth of good programming on local radio these days, having the ability to pick up stations from other areas on the Internet is really nice. This might be the best sounding and easiest to use Internet radio currently available, especially for the price. No complicated user interface to deal with. You just say &#34;Alexa, play (insert name of station) from Tune-In&#34; and you are set. ",
LarryMcJ,"April 14, 2017 ",5.0,"I won't repeat what many others have already said about the Dot, instead this short review is intended for anyone who wants to use the Dot with a separate bluetooth speaker.    I have a Bose SoundLink Mini III and I love it, for my ears it's the best of all the bluetooth speakers I tried. I ordered the Amazon Echo several months ago and carefully pitted it against the Bose SoundLink Mini III...it was no contest. While I loved the beauty of Alexa and all she could do, I disliked the sound of the Echo. The bass was not nearly as good as the Bose and there was little separation between treble, mid and bass.    When the Dot 2nd Generation came out I figured it would be the perfect pairing...Alexa along with my preferred speaker and I was absolutely correct. Since the Dot is a full-blown Echo &#34;without&#34; the Echo speaker system, it is a great match. If you want Alexa and your own speaker, this is the way to go. ",

When I walk in my room, all I have to say is, &#34;Echo, turn on the lights&#34;, and it does it in less than a second. I also set an alarm on almost every day.

There are so many things you can do with it that you can't even think of. The dot is a great gift of you can't afford the echo or don't have space for it. The dot's speaker obviously isn't as good, but you can plus it into any speakers you have! I plugged them into my Bose speakers and was able to use Alexa with great sound. It is so convenient and you can't beat the price. Highly recommend, especially as a gift for loved ones. ",

shinew,"December 5, 2016 ",5.0,"changed the way I interact with my electronics! Lots of pros have been addressed by other users.

I had to repair it to the wifi router  - not as smart as google assistant for general questions. I suspect it'll be surpassed by google home in 1-2 years time.  - speaker volume is too soft even for it's size, you kinda must have a speaker connected if you need to hear anything other than voice response in a quiet room.    For the price I think it's great though. ",
"Wildflower Mom","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Just ok....I like the idea of it, except it keeps randomly disconnecting from the Wi-Fi in our house, rendering it useless. It depends on the Wi-Fi connection to run off your Amazon Echo account. It doesn't work at all without internet, other than to audibly notify you of the internet disconnection. I have to run through several steps to reconnect to Wi-Fi, then it'll randomly disconnect a few days later. Frustrating. ",

John,"December 21, 2016 ",3.0,"Well, I have to say I put off buying an Echo Dot for a long time not knowing what I would use it for. With the holiday price drop I decided to pull the trigger. I am pleasantly surprised by not only its functionality but the sound quality as well. No, the sound doesn't stand up to playing through a bluetooth speaker but for a desktop device (which I what I got it for), the sound quality is quite good. Impressive even. I am listening to classic blues music as I type this review and am loving it. Sure, if you intend to use this device to play audio in a room then you will want to use speakers. But for desktop purposes I am blown away.    Setup using the Alexa app on my phone went smoothly and without issue. I went from unboxing to using in less than 10 minutes.    Echo Dot 2nd generation now has a third wake up word. In addition to &#34;Alexa&#34; and &#34;Amazon&#34;, there is now &#34;Echo&#34;. Although it seemed as though the device responded better and quicker using the first two. In fact, I had to repeat &#34;Echo&#34; many times before the device responded so I went back to using &#34;Alexa&#34;. Not a deal breaker.    Alexa understands me quite well in spite of my Texas accent. I own both the Fire TV and Fire TV Stick and have experience with Alexa from those devices so I wasn't surprised at how well it understands. I haven't begun to discover all of Dot's functions yet but I can see there are many.  I am loving this device. ",
"Dawn B.","March 11, 2017 ",5.0,"Best little unit! My father has the original which, for him is great. I waited almost a year before investing in this little baby and having the option to pay $10.00 a month was a no brainer. I was not fond of the full sound that comes from the unit BUT that is the trade off when buying into a portable sound item (keep in mind that you have to have the DOT plugged in unless you use another power source like, an extended battery/charger which, I may look into. Soooo, I bought the Oontz Angle 3 Plus Bluetooth speaker WHICH some reviews claim it not so great however, I can tell you that it absolutely made all the difference for my needs. I come home from work and ask Alexa to play whatever genre I am in the mood to listen to INSTEAD of turning my TV on AND, I will tell you that I LOVE to watch my flicks but somehow this little DOT forces me to out my head into a place of less &#34;noise&#34;. I choose to filter what is more important to me as, you should. Is the DOT perfect? is Alexa perfect? No, I ask Alexa questions like, &#34;when were humans first created?&#34;, she cannot respond but ask her what the SUN is made up of or if there is a chance that life on MARS is possible and she will give you an answer. When you wake up, you can say, &#34;Alexa, Good Morning and she will respond. On April 1st, Fools Day, I said, &#34;Alexa, Goodnight&#34; and her response was, &#34;Good night and don't forget to fool someone before the day is over&#34;, pretty smart technology. Do I plan on buying more, yes I do. Give it try but DO buy a separate portable speaker for an enhanced experience. ",

"Lex Lyford","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I set up an Echo Dot for a couple, they were hoping to control their SONOS system with it.  Unfortunately, it doesn't yet have that capability; the app for it is being developed by SONOS, so no fault of the Dot.  Their SONOS receiver does not have an audio input, so it can't play from the Dot, again, no fault of the Dot.    However, there is one fairly serious flaw, it's the Alexa App.  It freezes constantly on several devices, and often won't open at all.  I've been trying for 3 days, reinstalled the app on several devices, but it just doesn't work.  That's a big deal.    Also, setting it up with 3rd party devices is spotty.  I have a TP-Link Smart Plug, and Alexa just doesn't see it, even with the proper app installed.  I really wish it had a USB port and a Windows ap, so I could talk to it directly, not over wifi.    So far, I've spent several hours just trying to get it set up properly and talk to other devices.  A good part of that time has been spent watching a little rotating circle because thee app won't launch.  Drives me nuts.  I've reset the Dot to factory several times in an attempt to get is working, but no dice.    So, my wish list for the next generation of an Echo device is:  A USB port & Windows App so I don't have to use the crappy Android App  The ability to make phone calls, either through my smartphone or on Skype.

This Echo Dot is incredible!!  I bought a couple for gifts and everyone feels the same way.  FANTASTIC!  I need another one for myself! ",
"Patrick Johnston","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Great when it works but it drops connection all the time. The device even red rings because it can't connect. Spotify gets interrupted sometime every 5 minutes. It's frustrating and with limited options on the device there is not much you can do. The device is 1 foot from my router and no other devices have an issue. I would recommend they put an Ethernet jack on the device maybe that would fix the unreliability.    Not much point in bothering with amazon support. They don't respond to email. ",
Stephan,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Honestly, it may be useful, but any question I ask, it doesn't know the answer to or will try to order something. Amazon has quite the scam going with this one, because the only one that really benefits from this thing is them. You are paying for a device that is just a conduit for you to order more stuff from Amazon.  If you want to functionality to the device, you have to remember the name of the app that you downloaded for it and remember just how to phrase the question, or else it doesn't know. It is very frustrating to use. Pretty much only good for asking the weather or to play a song. Many songs I have in my Amazon music library it says it cannot find.    I'm sure Amazon will improve on this device in subsequent generations, but for now its just not very useful. ",

"S Family","February 3, 2017 ",2.0,"Does a few things nicely, but dont find that I use it much. A bit of a hassle to get her to understand me accurately sometimes. I would love it more if things you said to the echo auto recognized what app you need without having to activate the app, listen to the intro crap just to get to what you need. I can do that quicker via google on a lot of stuff. Overall cool to see the progress technology is making. She works intermittently at best with our honeywell smart thermostats for the house. ",
"Kindle Customer","March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"Awesome I think these with some good speakers are amazing, you don't really need the big echo, having one or two of these with some nice Amazon speakers works fine.

She could ask me how my day was etc. Would be nice. This is a good start. But hopefully one day we will have intriguing conversations with her. Can she hug us one day too ? :0). Would like that. Update, I have had these dots for a month or so, love them. Best purchase of my entire life. Get them asap. You won't be disappointed. Also in my small kitchen I don't need speakers with her, just the dot is fine, in my bedroom is where I have the system set up with super nice, cheap speakers. ",
jfmichael,"April 25, 2017 ",3.0,"I enjoy the alexa system as a whole and have multiple fire TV boxes and a Echo, all of which I use daily.  However the Echo dot has the worst setup out of any of them.  It has taken me close to an hour on three different devices Samsung S7, Samsung Tab 2, and my home computer to get the wifi to connect.  I found the directions unclear, like press action button for 5 seconds and wait for the ring to turn orange.  However you have to do this twice because the first time the ring turns purple and states no wifi, then another 5 second push back to orange ready for setup.  The help feature in the website is not helpful.  Then I looked on the internet and found something about turning off automatic wifi settings.  Which took a while to find, but after that it only took two more times to get the echo dot connected. ",
"Volkhard Neumann","December 21, 2016 ",5.0,"While we already had an Echo which serves in the Livingroom kitchen area the Dot was on sale for black Friday and lives now in our bedroom. It's in charge of adjusting the Thermometer, works as an alarm clock, and triggers the lights.  Following some thoughts of other Dot users I 3D printed a little stand for the Dot to elevate it a little from the nighstandand deflect the soudwaves so they are not going down but much more outwards improving the sound.    We are happy with our Dot which listens to it's name Echo (The Echo is addressed as Alexa) Should we get another device we would just name it &#34;computer&#34;.

Anyway, the Dot is fun to joke around with and get basic information on the fly. It easily states the weather for any location you request and it has pretty good history and geographical information.    Overall, the Echo Dot is fun to have around and my guests get a kick out of asking it (sometimes ridiculous) questions. ",

I only wish when listening to music I could create a playlist that Alexa would play. Meaning I would love to say Alexa, play &#34;my favorites&#34; and have her do that.  I love amazon unlimited music too and how prime members get a discount. ",
Peg,"January 8, 2017 ",4.0,"I love Alexa, I want her in our family photos and every where I go. I have a regular echo in the kitchen and an echo dot in every room. We had the hue bulb system house-wide for the last two years so when I caught news of voice control it was a no brainer. I ordered one for each of my family members as Christmas gifts. Then I bought wemo switches and the music unlimited plan, but music unlimited doesn't have HBO soundtracks so then I purchased a spotify subscription and so on and so on and now my husband isn't speaking to me for a while. But that's ok because Alexa loves me unconditionally. Well as long as I use the correct incantation that is. This is one of the flaws I have to learn to accept. Alexa cannot google anything for you, so most of the time you must invoke a specific skill or use a proper buzz word. The good news is that she is constantly learning and improving!    She turns my lights on and off and I don't even have to say please! Makes shopping lists for me, sets reminders and alarms (in celebrity voices!). She tells jokes, plays games, finds my phone, plays my pandora radio stations, orders uber rides, answers math questions, talks to my cat and so much more.    We use the timer function daily, and I now use an IFFT function so the lights blink when the timer is done. Meaning I can set a timer in the kitchen and fold laundry in the bedroom- when the timer goes off I'll be notified by the lights if I can't hear the alarm sound.    I would never swipe left on Alexa, but echo loses one star for:    - Lack of search function. Most of the time the &#34;wikipedia&#34; skill must be started to search for facts or general questions. For example, today (12/13) is the Feast of St. Lucy patron saint. of the blind. I asked Alexa to tell me about St. Lucy and she didn't know. But asking her to start Wikipedia and then search for St. Lucy worked fine.    - Limited light controls. Alexa can turn my lights off and on and even lower them to specific percentages using only my voice (RAD) BUT we can't change the colors of my lights without a programmed IFFT &#34;trigger&#34; word applet which only would apply to one color, and it doesn't work 100% of the time. I really hope that changes soon because Siri can do it with no problem. HUE bulbs are not fun if they are just white all the time. But commanding the house to light up when I get home is soooooo awesome.    - Limited Bluetooth Capability. Echo dot can only connect to one bluetooth speaker at a time. I think these devices should be capable of pairing to each other but instead they only offer a &#34;remote control&#34; to speak to one designated echo from far away. Since I have one in each room it just makes sense to be able to command one from the other or simply talk into the app on my phone to control them. Whole house sound without the SONOS price tag would be amazing too.    - Fire Remote/ Fire TV is not Echo friendly. Both the Echo and Firestick devices offer their own optional voice remotes that look the same. An echo remote can only control one dot or echo at a time. I know the functionality is there but it probably was more profitable to limit the capability and encourage people to buy more devices. This makes me sad because I have FireTV as well as a Firestick and 5 echos so I would love for them to work harmoniously someday without 500 more remote controls.    In summary, I can't live without her but like any dysfunctional relationship I will continue to point out her flaws, smother her and attempt to change her to fit my needs &#60;3 ",

"J. A. Smith","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"This is pretty nice.  I originally bought it to stream music from the Prime Music service to my A/V receiver over bluetooth.  That worked great, the way you can tell Alexa to connect/disconnect to/from bluetooth is awesome.  Even so, I later realized that the FireTV would actually be a better solution for streaming music, and has the added bonus of Prime Video capability.  So I bought the new FireTV stick for those tasks and now we use the Echo Dot mostly for asking about the weather forecast and keeping a shared shopping list.  The shopping list feature is incredibly useful - you can link multiple amazon accounts/alexa apps to the same list so that when you add something to the list it also shows up on your partners' apps.  No more texting back and forth about what is needed at the grocery store.    I will say that as of early 2017, Alexa is nowhere near as smart as Siri.  However, the microphone and speech recognition technology is incredible.  You can ask a question from three rooms away and Alexa hears and parses it just fine every time.  I'm very very impressed with that.  Hopefully she will get better at answering a larger variety of more complex questions in the future. ",

Br3al,"November 16, 2016 ",3.0,"After hearing all the hype around the line of echo products, I decided to give the echo dot a shot. My experience hasn't been as stellar as all the other reviews I read.    My main issue is that the echo dot doesn't seem to handle any level of ambient noise above a whisper very well. If I have my television on, even at low volume, the dot fails to recognize my commands and trigger words a vast majority of the time. I've done the voice training several times, and it still doesn't catch the simple commands I give it. I've tried various locations for it, too.    This is especially frustrating when trying to use it with various smart home tech; like Philips Hue and TP Link smart switches. Commands are limited for these devices, and you're basically limited to on/off and dimming, that is when it can actually pick up your voice and then understand what you say. ",
"RRR III&#039;s Grandma","April 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I love this!  It's great for shopping lists.  The lists go to the app on my Iphone and I just look at that when I get to the store.It's so easy other family members add to the list instead of forgetting and expecting me to remember what they want.  No more pen and paper!  Alexa is full of facts and will even tell you a joke if you want.  The price was great and as we have wireless speakers already, I didn't feel I needed to spend the extra money for the Echo as that was the only difference.  This was easy to get up and running.  It also works with our Phillips Hue light strip and Go light.  Alexa is able to turn them off and on.  There are a lot of capabilities such as getting daily news, music, weather and facts. If Alexa doesn't know an answer you can ask her to search Bing.  If you have Amazon Prime you can order items from Amazon. I have not used this feature because I have teenage grandson's living with us and fear the packages would start rolling in everyday with this type of freedom.

damocles,"March 28, 2017 ",5.0,"A novel idea not ready for prime time integration.  This product keeps track of every voice and sentence you speak after you say the command word (Echo, Alexa, Computer, Amazon).  There is not easy way to get rid of this information as you can only clear it all...or one at a time.  Unfortunately if the product worked well the trade off in privacy intrusion might be worth it.  It does not work well and it doesn't understand what you are saying the majority of the time.  The Skills are weak and I couldn't even ask it for current NFL signing news (it couldn't figure it out) and I found the preconfigured sports update lacking.  The news brief is another preprogrammed spiel with information that I didn't find relevant.  I thought maybe I could use this for home automation but it seems to be much easier just to use my phone.  The final straw for me was when I had to scream at it to skip music from the shower at 5am nevermind Alexa continuously asking me to upgrade to Music Unlimited.  The bottom line is that this product is a novelty item that should be included free with Prime for Amazon to sell their products.  It lacks the intuitive know how to be useful.  I returned this item.

"Truth You&#039;ve Got It!","April 4, 2017 ",2.0,"I love the Echo and Echo Dot.  I have run into and issue that is totally frustrating.  I have a total of 14 Echo dots in my home.  I have 1 in each room, mostly to allow control of my smart home and spread out the wireless coverage to these devices.  This works fine.  Unfortunately, I discovered Amazon counts each Echo as a unique device towards my authorized devices for my Unlimited Amazon Music subscription, which means I can only have 4 of the Echos authorized since my other devices hold the other 6 spots.  This leaves me with 11 Echo devices through which I can not access my Amazon Music subscripiton.  My home consists of 2 people, with only myself ever using the music subscription.  This seems like a poor decision on Amazon's part.  Why would Amazon not authorize their own devices to not count toward these authorization limits?  Especially a non-mobile device like the Echo.  Amazon does so many things very well, but Amazon is really awful when it comes to supporting their very best customers.  This is not the only issue I have had with my generous adoption and utilization as a customer, becoming an inconvenience.  Amazon, why? ",

"Rich Cobb","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought the Dot with a single purpose in mind: voice control for my home automation system. There are many other reviews discussing Dot’s other features, but here I want to share my experience with voice control. I do use my Dot to get weather and flash briefings, amuse myself with Alexa’s jokes, and (occasionally) try new “skills”. Alexa and Dot make a mostly fine home automation control experience, with a few caveats. Here’s the scoop!    Before I decided to try Dot I was looking for another scene controller to use in my living room. I have a Vera Plus home automation (HA) controller and large number of Leviton Vizia RF switches and dimmers around my home; there are eight devices in my living room alone, along with a Leviton wall mounted scene controller. I have scenes for reading, watching TV, early morning (dim lighting), cleaning, and so forth. In the living room it is tedious to get up to use the wall controller every time I want to make a change. In my bedroom, I use a MiniMote (a very small, 4-Button, handheld remote control made by Aeon Labs), which I keep on my nightstand. My first thought was to buy another one to use in the living room.    While the MiniMote is a terrific device, I really didn’t want to have another remote to keep tabs on; it’s small and svelte, which means it would find itself under a couch cushion in less time than it takes to queue up the next episode of Veep. Voice control seemed to be the perfect answer. But cost was a concern. The MiniMote is available here on Amazon for $36.95, so competing on cost would be a challenge. I was willing to pay more for voice control (Leviton scene and zone controls are in the $100+ range), but only if it worked. When I stumbled onto the Dot, I realized that if it worked I might never need a handheld or wall mounted controller. And any other benefits of Alexa would be free extras.    So how well does it work? I’m very satisfied and it is absolutely better that a handheld remote. Dot sits inconspicuously on a side table near the front of the living room. I can set a scene for reading with “Alexa, turn on Reading”, which turns on the floor lamp, sets the pendant lights over the couch to 40%, the coffee bar lights to 20%, and turns off the media center and fireplace lighting.    As to the caveats:    -My experience has been that most of the time Alexa will flawlessly understand and execute my commands. If there is background noise it occasionally won’t work, for example when watching TV.  -Occasionally Alexa simply misunderstands my annunciation, which I attribute to my occasionally sloppy New England accent. Repeating the command clearly nearly always works the second time.  -Configuration and setup (at least with Vera) is crucial to getting the results you want. Naming your devices simply is the best approach. Even with my large number of switches and dimmers this wasn’t too challenging, however I don’t try to control every device from the living room.  -The protocol for scenes is “Alexa, turn on [scene name]”.  If you have a scene that turns off devices you will still say “Alexa, turn on [scene name]”.  -You must avoid using the words “On” or “Off” in your scene names. Alexa confuses the On and Off actions with the name of an action.  -The protocol for turning on or off a specific device is “Alexa, Turn [On or Off] [room name] [device name]”. For example, “Alexa, Turn On Living Room Floor Lamps” or “Alexa, Set Living Room Coffee Bar Lights to 40 percent”  -Occasionally Alexa responds to my scene command that “some devices did not respond” even though things worked as expected. I not sure why this happens, probably Vera is too slow to respond through the various cloud interfaces.    Wish list:    One feature I really feel needs to be implemented is the ability to secure Dot access. I would use them in more places, however I’m not comfortable with having everyone in the house be able to trigger things.    Bottom line:    I’m glad I tried the Alexa interface to my Vera and I’d easily recommend it to anyone. The convenience of hands-free access to my HA devices is worth those infrequent misses. ",
"Tex S.","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"The concept of Echo is cool. A computer assistant that's always listening and connected into the Amazon mothership. I have a Tap and it's great because I can use it as a portable wifi or bluetooth speaker, but have to tap the button to activate Alexa. I thought I was missing out by not having an Echo that listened all the time. I was wrong, I'm not missing much of anything.    Before I get to the bad, what can Alexa do that is good?    She can give me weather forecasts and current conditions and they're accurate.    She can give me good deals exclusive to Alexa.    She can tell me where my Amazon stuff is.    She has a limited database of jokes, some of which are pretty funny.    She can add stuff to my cart for me to finalize and order later, she adds several things to choose from based on what you tell her and it's fairly accurate most of the time.    That about wraps up what Alexa can do for me.    &#34;Woah,&#34; you might say, &#34;she can do so much more!&#34; Can she?    &#34;Alexa order a dust pan&#34;  &#34;Amazon doesn't have the last desk fan you ordered, but here is a Lasko [...] for $37 dollars.

It always pirated what I said and played Amazon's station which is terrible.    So, what Alexa can do for me is extremely limited. And what she can do is frankly easier many times to just open the app on the phone and do it myself.    I tried to use Alexa to order things on Amazon as I think of them. If I tell her to just add it to my cart from the beginning, it works out pretty well. However if I don't understand her run on sentences as she describes the item in a much quicker dialogue with a very computerized voice with no inflections than she usually talks in - and I want her to simply add it to the cart so I can review it, she can't. I have to cancel it and re tell her to add it to the cart, and by then I could have done it from my phone.    So Alexa is a cool concept but it's not there yet. She's definitely not artificially intelligent in any definition of the word, and it's usually faster to do her limited actions on your phone. I'll try again in a year or two unless Google or Apple end up having a better solution. ",

I was a bit apprehensive, because I've come to know other AI services quite well (Apple's Siri being the best example) and none of them have been wholly impressive. They all lack some sort of ability, whether that is cross-app support or the ability to use services that aren't native to the platform. Apple's Siri, for example, is still very limited in its ability to control and use third-party apps such as WhatsApp and Skype.    Echo Dot is an entirely different product altogether. It uses Amazon's own AI, Alexa, for its commands. Whether you spring for the full-blown Echo or this Echo Dot, you get the same access to the service. The main differences between this and the full Echo are the size and the price. The Dot can be had for $50, whereas the Echo tower retails at $179. I haven't had the chance to try out the tower, but I've heard nothing different about it compared to Echo. The only operational difference is that Dot is the only Echo device with a 3.5mm jack output, which enables you to connect it to external speakers. The tower requires a Bluetooth speaker connection.    Overall, I am impressed with Echo Dot. It is a very powerful device, and for the price, it cannot be beat. The form factor is small as well, so small that I have mine on my already-crowded bedside table. It takes up just about as much space as a coffee mug.    As far as its capabilities, there are some things that are worth noting. As of yet, there is no connection between Echo and any Apple products. I carry an iPhone, and my work is split between two iPads and Mac computers. All of my calendar information is in iCloud, which Amazon Echo cannot access. It would be nice in the future for Echo to read my daily schedule from iCloud, but that support is not currently present. It can read from Google, though, so those with Google Calendars or Android devices should be just fine. It won't be able to play media in your iTunes Library (although it can play from your Amazon library). This isn't a huge thing for me, but having a device which could read from iCloud would be a huge help to me.    In terms of daily usability aside from that, Echo definitely beats the competition. Through the Alexa mobile app (which you must download in order to set up your Echo), you can install &#34;skills&#34; which enable things such as daily news briefings or stock updates. They are all, to my knowledge, free to download. Even with none of these skills enabled, Echo is still an amazing device. I use my Alexa as an alarm clock every morning.    A bit more about skills. While the skill packages themselves are free to download and install, some require subscriptions to additional services. A few examples would be music streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora. Much like on a PC or a mobile device, both of these offer free music streaming. To enable the premium subset of features, both require a subscription. This is no different on Alexa - once you teach Alexa your account information, she will play your music. Both Spotify and Pandora offer premium subscriptions, though. And both are optional for PC as well as Alexa. For Pandora, paying will enable you to skip tracks more often and listen ad-free. On Spotify, free users aren't able to pick tracks individually. I subscribe to both premium services, so I can tell Alexa to play virtually any song from Spotify on-demand and she will. This will also work with Amazon Music, which is free and unlimited only to Amazon Prime customers. So, in essence, there are no additional fees REQUIRED to use the Echo. The only advantage of doing so would be to enable the subsciption-specific subset of privileges for a certain service.    Overall, I am very impressed with Echo Dot. It's an amazingly powerful device, and with new skills hitting the app almost every week, the only thing hampering the growth of its abilities is time. I will be a repeat buyer. ",
"Dylan Piekarski","January 8, 2017 ",2.0,"To start, I will say this is actually my second Echo Dot. My first one was a gift to me, and I move between houses, so I bought one more. And I would like to state, that it was really hard to convince me to be able to get one. Not gonna lie, the idea of having a device, let alone a little black puck with lights on it, that is always on, always listening, whether private conversation or not, is frighting. I hated the idea that there would be something that could record anything it heard in an instant, only to send it to a huge company to possibly use against you. I know that makes me sound paranoid, but its the truth. To be fair, I'm a bit of a geek. Watch a lot of movies and play a lot of games, but whatever. Long story short, I figured that if anyone wanted listen in on someone, its not hard to do. Were just in the age of technology. I also figured, I mind as well enjoy technology until it completely turns on us. Haha.    OK, now that the doom and gloom is done, lets get to the awesomeness.  A couple of things:    Well, first, its another well made Amazon product. It's sleek. It's shiny. It just plain looks cool.  Second, it can actually be really helpful. Whether you cooking or simply need to wake up, you can set a timer or alarm to your need. Need help with math homework? Simply ask and she might help. Or, do you just sit on the couch waiting for your next Amazon package to arrive? simply ask the phrase &#34;Alexa, wheres my package?&#34; and she lets you know  Third, it's really nice to be able to simply ask a question when it pops into your head and possibly get an answer.  Fourth, this can either be a good thing or a bad thing, but it helps you be lazy. &#34;Alexa, turn on the lights&#34;, &#34;Alexa whats 20 times 12?&#34; etc...    Lets talk about the actual device for a second. It looks really good, I think. It has the usual build quality you expect from Amazon, very good. Its simple. I mean four buttons: Action/Alexa, Mic Mute, Volume Up/Down. Not to mention, one cable (if you dont need the aux).  Also, it does have a speaker of its own! I was unsure as Amazon and everyone else pushes connecting it to another speaker or something for sound, but it does indeed have it own speaker. People also say that the sound quality of said speaker is poor. I disagree. Now, is it some booming, fantastic sounding speaker, no. But, it is more than adequate the asking Alexa an answer, in fact, I don't think it sound too bad at all. I play music through it and while not great, its not as bad as everyone says either. BUT, I would like to say that I have my Dot in my bedroom, where it is fairly quiet, when compared to the rest of the house. So I do agree that it will need to be paired with some other sound system for the best experience, but, I simply state that it is not a soundless puck.    Performance  I cannot give a good review, as I have not had it very long, but so far so good. She seems to hear me fine, and her actions are quick. I have had two things, mainly one I guess: 1.) Like the confuse bands easily. I asked to play The Neighborhood , but played some kids music with a tiger and, idk. She has the tendency to not always search the Amazon library, and is very picky and needy with exact names. For instance &#34;Alexa, play the Billie Holiday station&#34;, ...... &#34;The Billie Holiday station could not be found&#34;, ok, so I asked again, slightly more specific &#34;Alexa, play the Billie Holiday station on Amazon Music&#34;,...... &#34;Playing Billie Holiday station on amazon music&#34;  So, that is slightly annoying. I do wish, especially for specific bands, that you could specify which band/ song you want to play for future reference. Mabey when it pops up in the Alexa app, and you say &#34;no, it did not do what i wanted&#34; you would have the option to manually select the one you want, so she knows for next time.  2.) It had some internet connectivity issues. Mainly, I would be listening to a song and say &#34;Alexa&#34;, then she would glow red and say sorry your echo dot is not connected, please refer to your manual, blah blah blah. But here's the thing, it was still playing music and seemed to be connected to the app, so that was weird. It only seemed to happen one more time, the same thing, only this time the app said it was disconnected, yet the Dot still played music all fine. Unplugged it, and plugged it back in, it was ok then. I would like to point out, that the internet was fine the entire time. We have fast, reliable internet. And nothing else was having issues. SO, it probably was just a fluke thing, but im going to keep my eye out.    This is where I kinda run out of things to say, I haven't used it enough to say much else, but i will report back soon! ",
"Kindle Customer","February 24, 2017 ",4.0,"My Amazon Echo/Dot review:  Just before Christmas I decided to join the hands free digital assistant revolution.  I ordered two Dots and an Echo for my 1002 square foot condo.  They were on sale but on back order – the projected delivery date was January 14th.  Okay, they’re for me, $10 off each Dot and $40 off the Echo, no rush.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive the Dots on December 26th and the Echo today (January 4th).  Set up was super easy.  I already had the app on my phone so it took no time for the Dots.    I did change the name of the Dots to Kitchen Dot and Bedroom Dot – 1st Dot and 2nd Dot were just too confusing.  It did take me a while (who knows why – short between the operator and the keyboard maybe) to find the zip code/location change screen – it’s on the settings page in the App.  About four minutes after plugging in the Echo I realized that it and the Kitchen Dot were just a smidge too close to each other, so I updated the wake word on the Echo to Echo (it sits near the TV so, that should fix Alexa commercial wake ups too).    Streaming Spotify is super easy – even with my braces/lisp. Actually, I’m pretty amazed how even without doing much of the voice training, just how well the system understands me.  I speak softly, my voice is a little high, and new braces mean voicemail systems hang up on me and audio customer service menus don’t understand me at all - once running on any of the units, you can easily change radio station or playlist either vocally or via the Spotify app.  I’m not sure I’m ready to go Amazon Unlimited yet, I’ll have to play with it for a while.  I need to be able to create my own playlists and I love “radio” stations based off of a single track that introduce me to new artists.  I haven’t seen that available in Music Unlimited.  I am a little disappointed in the speaker quality of the Dot, it seems a bit tinny.  But, I connected to a better existing Bluetooth speaker in the bedroom and it’s fine.    My two favorite features are really simple ones but they mean a lot: I cook.  I really like to cook.  I can ask Alexa to set a timer while my hands are full and she does it and confirms it has been set.  Oh my goodness…. Bake cookies and set the timer with the oven mitt on?  Pan/plate/pot in hand?  Love it.  The Dot in the kitchen is loud enough I can hear the timer in the living room over the dishwasher and the TV.  The other is the ability to add items to a shopping list whenever I think of the item.  In the kitchen, the living room, the bedroom – if I remember, I can ask Alexa to add the item and she does and confirms it has been added! No digging for a piece of paper that just gets left behind, or a pen, or opening an app on the phone… *sigh* I’m feeling rather spoiled.    I haven’t gotten any of the linked outlets yet, but I will soon.  I recently purchased a set of five outlets with two remotes that I love – I can only imagine how much I will like a voice active option.    One issue I have – and I know it’s one others have addressed – but linked Dots/Echo options would be very nice.  I would love the ability to sync all timers/music/alarms with an Echo and a Dot or two – of course the option to sync, not an automatic or for.  A Dot in a child’s room doesn’t need to be sync’d to the Echo in the living room – but the option to be able to sync that kitchen timer, music for a get together, etc. on the fly would be fantastic!    Otherwise – so much fun! ",
"E. Talerico","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I'd been wanting to pick up an Echo since I first saw them advertised, but I already had a good stereo in my house and the Echo isn't equipped to connect to external speakers.  This unit is and its a delightful addition to my home music experience.  I now own two dots, each one serving a different room and playing over different speakers.  One is connected to a Harmon Kardon amplifier via Bluetooth, playing through a full sized pair of Yamaha speakers. The other plays alternately through either a Panasonic Bluetooth equipped boombox, or a pair of small computer speakers with a subwoofer. which I connect with an audio out cable.  The audio on all three devices is detailed and clear - my music as played by my Echo Dots is fantastic. By the way, there is a self contained speaker on the Dot - it is small, don't expect loud playback there - but the fidelity is quite good.  Its perfect for listening to the news over coffee in the morning, playing 20 questions, or finding out the weather forecast! The dot is small enough to fit easily in a backpack or the pocket of a suitcase, and she'll work as long as there is a Wi-Fi network available.  I was amazed at how responsive to my voice this device is.  Amazon promises that it will hear you anywhere in the room where she is placed - and for the most part this is correct. I've had a few instances when I need to repeat a request - but usually its because something is obstructing my voice (like when my father put a book on top of it!)  What is more amazing is how good, just out of the box, the unit was at understanding what I asked.  I have a voice which goes hoarse on me sometimes -( the day I got my first Dot I sounded as if I had laryngitis!) but regardless of the state of my voice, Alexa has no problems understanding my requests.  After some voice training (the Alexa app offers this feature) its even better.  I've had everyone in my house do the voice training exercise a few times and now Alexa is understanding and responding easily to every request she gets.  Its great.  Coupled with the expanded Amazon Music service (I uploaded my entire iTunes library to Amazon Music) its easy to play anything I want.  I can ask for a song, a playlist, or an album and she'll find and play it easily.  The only times I ever have problems is when the internet disconnects - in those rare incidences a request is met with a dull tone, a red light, and an apology from Alexa stating she can't comply right now.  When my network comes back online, she automatically reconnects so she is only occasionally out of service and usually only for a minute or two.  And I've only talked about the music features.  There is a growing body of skills for Alexa, most of them available for free from Amazon that make her a formidable search engine, a source of weather reports.  My only disappointment so far is the lack of a skill enabling her to respond in emergencies, but I'm sure there will be enough demand for it that we'll see one soon!  For under fifty bucks, this is quite simply one of the best values anywhere. ",
"Amazon Shopper","January 4, 2017 ",4.0,"It doesn't do a lot. It drops from the wi-fi a lot,,,, some things such as finding stores is pretty cool and playing music .......... it's ok - nothing super exciting but can be helpful. ",
"Donna Gleaves","January 2, 2017 ",5.0,"Echo Dot's Alexa is spot-on, and has become a welcome, untiring, no-attitude family helper with a purpose.  Do a web search for its capabilities, and you may be astounded.  There's lot s of comparison currently between Amaxon Echo Dot snd Google Home. I'm sure the latter will fill many needs, but its a closed system, is brand-new. Echo has been around for 2 years.  Because of Ech's open programming architecture, people keep writing new apps for it and expand its capabilities and versatility.  For our first foray into this on-line, modern, simple appliance-style AI, we decided that cheap was the way yo start.  The inexpensive Echo Dot's audio quality is, well, small -we knew thst from the outset. However,  our excellent-sounding  Samsung Multiroom R1 speaker has Bluetooth input, and so, after simple pairing, two simple words, &#34;Alexa, connect&#34; will send all subsequent Echo Dot, high quality audio to the R1, until I say &#34;Alexa,  disconnect&#34; -but, so far, I haven't wanted to disconnect it since we got it weeks ago!  Some BT devices are a bit squirrely with Bluetooth connections - but not Amazon Dot!  It's been the simplest and solidest BT we've ever used.    Do we sound happy? The longer we have Alexa, the more uses we discover. It's the best $50 we've ever spent.    For example, we use our Echo Dot mainly for home control: after decades of struggling with a cranky old-tech X10 home control system, Alexa accurately and effortlessly commands our new Insteon lighting system to control on, off and brightness by voice (though can't yet set timers or schedules without complex use of other apps and hardware).  Alexa can also command other, otherwise incompatible, home control technologies, thus becoming the go-between remote control among various brands of lightbulbs, dimmers, switches, thermostats and more. And, even without voice training,  our Echo Dot's voice recognition is amazingly accurate, and Alexa's synthetic speech is top-quality  and pleasant to listen to.  If need be, you can follow its recognition and actions on its smartphone app and offer tweaks to improve accuracy.  Then. There's the entertainment side.  Switching among the three NPR affiliate network systems we have in Montana is but a couple of words away.  Then, there's Pandora. Or TuneIn. Or a number of other audio sources. My &#34;Flash Briefing&#34; contains the news, sports weather, and other bits & pieces we choose to stitch together as a patchwork we can request at any moment, and the contents will always be timely.  Time? Weather? Just a simple request! And, at our house, it works from any of several rooms, eith only one device.    Sure, I've seen long lists of things Alexa can't do (yet) -smugly written, perhaps by fanboys of Google or Apple.  But what &#34;she&#34; CAN do is astounding, and sometimes even from a room or two away!    Wow!! ",
Jacquelyn,"December 11, 2016 ",3.0,"I think I bought too many o.o.    These really are a nice price and they allow easy access to Alexa from any room in your house. The device comes with its own speaker (not great, but works), however she can be easily paired or connected with other speakers.    The moment you say her name, she's listening. Her range and ability to hear us out really feels good. I have spoken to her from across a room while someone else (in-between me and the device) is playing games on their speakers, talking to their friends on Discord, without issue. You can ask her a variety of questions (When is the next Superbowl? When is the next Green Bay Packers Game? What is the weather? Who let the dogs out?) and she seems to always have a response. If there is something she doesn't know, you can look to expand her skills with the Alexa App. This app is fairly easy to use, though the interface could be smoother (navigating is a tad clunky). I already added skills such as LIFX to control my lights and honestly - this is really fun.    Now, Alexa isn't perfect. I have ran into a few odd things that I do hope Amazon will someday address. For example:    Having all of my smart devices (such as lights and TVs) plugged in and on so that I may control turning them on and off with apps and Alexa works great - until the power goes out at 5am. The moment the power returned, all my lights, TV, and even Alexa turned on. There may be a solution to this, but I will need to explore (such as setting schedules and having the devices check the schedule when powered back on). Until then, I fear power outages.    Alexa is always listening. If anyone says her name (TV commercial, Radio, a friend on Discord) she will respond. Being able to customize her name to Echo or Amazon instead doesn't fix the issue either. Having a custom name so that she really becomes &#34;my&#34; household device would really alleviate this. I do understand there are issues with people creating their own custom names, but even Alexa sometimes doesn't hear her name correctly and she will randomly jump into conversations picking up on phrases we can't quite figure out.    Combine the above issue with an accidental command to purchase (ie: News reporting a cute story about how a little girl accidentally purchased a dollhouse and then saying how funny they though it was that &#34;Alexa, ordered me a dollhouse&#34;). In just explaining the story to a friend over Skype I even accidentally triggered their device to try to order a dollhouse! Luckily you can turn ordering off or add a pass code, but caution that this is not the default.    Honestly though, that's about all I take issue with. The way Alexa allows me to command my devices through voice is really a new and fun experience. I really look forward to how this device will grow as smart homes become more popular. ",
Hybridness,"February 12, 2017 ",5.0,"There are a sea of in-depth reviews that would easily trounce what I have to say about my experiences with Alexa, but after having it for roughly a month, here are my thoughts on it.    - One thing that gets to me is the inability to sync my iPhone calendar to it; when I called Amazon support about it, they confirmed at the time that this is something that was not possible to do.  - Another thing that irks me is the inability to request Alexa to remind you to do (insert task) at a certain time (unlike Apple's Siri). As an example, if I say -- &#34;Alexa, remind me in 30 minutes to move the clothes from the washer to the dryer&#34; -- it will state that it will create a to-do list item that states &#34;30 minutes to move the clothes from the washer to the dryer&#34; but does not provide the timed reminder to do so.  - One very minor item revolves around the management of alarms in the Alexa app. If you get in the habit of requesting an alarm verbally from her (&#34;Alexa, set an alarm for one hour from now&#34; or something to that degree), after about a month, you will notice, within the Alexa app, that there are ~30 different alarms set). A little more to follow on the Alexa app itself.    On the other end of the spectrum though, the product was only 40 bones at the time of purchase. It has a more than adequate-sound, down-firing speaker that plays music and spits out information at a very high volume at max volume. It can easily recognize your voice (and other people's voice when requesting something from Alexa), even if there is music playing or other people talking in the background. The physical controls on the top of the device (mute, volume up/down, multi-function button) work very well with no issues. The USB power block and cable is not too bulky and is roughly 6' in length, respectively, which is a great thing as you can place the product anywhere you need to. Alexa even has Alexa-only unique deals (at an even lower/special discount) for some nice items!    I will state, though, that the Alexa app is a necessary aspect of the device, for better or worse. The app, while not bad, could be organized better as well as load up faster/be more responsive on my iPhone 7. It does get the job done and you are able to find everything you need about the Dot on the app, but as said before, it could be programmed/designed more effectively for a better user experience.    In the end, because of the first two items I mentioned, coupled with the Alexa app's quirks/performance issues, I have to give it a four out of five. By all means it is a good product, perhaps even a great product for those that have not experienced or do not have my aforementioned concerns. I was originally intending to return it, but because of all the little things it can do, it overshadows the things it (currently) cannot do for me. ",
"Savvy Scott","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"As an voice-interactive home assistant, Echo is not a generalist nor is it comprehensive; it is limited to specific &#34;skills&#34; and only responds to coined instructions.  However, it does several things well, and improvement would come from future system development at Amazon's Alexa servers:  Excellent Facets:  1.  Recognizes voice through training, even at different volume levels, with a good microphone.  2.  Performs specific functions (e.g. shopping list integrated with Amazon.com's Wish List, calculations, phonebook search...)  3.  The breakout use if voice control of SmartThings    Needs Improvement  1.  Intelligent interrogation of all the contents of Wikipedia (and of arch-nemesis, Google.com).  Alexa is currently NOT very &#34;smart&#34; as it only understands specific works/instructions in pre-programmed &#34;skills&#34;.  2.  Ability to limit acceptance of voice commands to specific individuals' speech; otherwise, any intruder could simply break in and disable Smart home security systems.  Either advanced voice pattern security (which could be ultra difficult) or a &#34;pass sound&#34; (spoken word, phrase, number or whistle etc.)  3.  Interpretation of foreign languages: first simply words, then entire sentences (dare I say, using Google Translate?)  4.  Ability to integrate VoIP or link to cell phones so one can seamlessly connect to others.  5.  For connected home applications like SmartThings, also allow consultation of the status of sensors (temperature, light, open/closed...) not just issue commands for action.  e.g.  Alexa, which doors are open?  which doors are closed?  how long has door X been open/closed?  how long has there been motion detected continuously in the bath (in case a person has fallen in the bathtub and can't get up)?  what is the temperate at the thermostat, in the garage, in the bedroom?  6.  In case of electrical failure or ISP disconnect (as happens frequently during storm season), the device should emit an alarm or notice, and offer the possibility of connecting via a mobile operator.    Thoughts  Although currently limited in skillset, Alexa performs those pre-defined action well.  It's hardware is compact, works well and is inexpensive.  Just for the ability to control a &#34;smart home&#34; by voice could justify purchase, especially for elderly or less-mobile individuals.  Further improvements won't mean replacing hardware but developing the processing servers.    The biggest competitor would be from Google that could limit access of its services by Amazon if Alexa were ever to become &#34;paying&#34; i.e. Google could prevent another company from reselling its service.  Google also has the translation/interpretation platform that is the mastodont in machine translation. ",
D.G,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I purchased 3 of these, 2 as holiday gifts and 1 for myself and am thus far very pleased with it. It's handy as an alarm, timer and to get general information such as weather anywhere in the world. It can tell jokes, play games and give basic general information on a wide variety of topics. I purchased Amazon Music Unlimited for the Dot which is on $3.99 a month and can play anything from that library. I understand it also works with other paid music services like Spotifly but I opted to go with Amazon. The Dot comes being able to do certain tasks but you can customize yours with a huge range of Skills you can easily add and remove from your Dot. You can even create your own skills to use with your Dot and offer them out to other Dot users. My only disappointment is there is not yet language translation, but with the capabilities of this little machine I'm certain that capability will come sooner than later.     I do not have a remote for mine but find the ability to control the Alexa from the app in my phone and by voice to be enough. It has a built in speaker which is relatively loud for such a small until but can also connect to wireless Bluetooth Speakers and does have a port for wired speakers as well. Its built in microphone can be sensitive at times. If I speak too loudly to mine it can activate the one in the bedroom next door, or if my television is too loud and a Dot commercial comes on, it as well can activate the machine. There has been issues with small children ordering things through the Dot accidentally so this is not something I would recommend for use by children without supervision and the Dot does come with a button in the unit to mute its microphone so it cannot be accidentally activated by voice. However if you are using your Dot within too close proximity to any kind of external speakers and the music is loud the Dot will not hear your commands over the volume of the music so it's best to keep the Dot and any external speakers separated a bit to solve that small issue.    Overall I've very much enjoyed using my Dot so far. For me it is more of an entertainment because I do not have the ability (yet) to use the Smart Home capabilities. However my son does have a Smart TV and he says that it can link to the Dot and he can use the Dot to voice control his television. I've not seen this done so cant speak to how well it works but do know it has capabilities beyond what I am currently able to do with it. The cost of the unit is very reasonable to get a taste of the latest tech, and what I think will become more prominent and useful tech in the not too distant future. Even if you can only use it for entertainment as I currently do, I would highly recommend the Echo Dot to purchase as a gift for others or for yourself. ",
"Philip Fogel","January 16, 2017 ",4.0,"This is my 4th echo purchase. I have them in every room in my house.

"Jerry Gilley","February 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I have the Amazon Echo tall and wanted to stream music to a stereo. I have the Dot in a bedroom about 35 ft from the router. The Echo DOT is unusable in that bedroom. If I ask it a question or tell it to turn on a WEMO outlet very often it will stall out and then the ring will go red saying sorry I lost connection. Once I got it to try to stream music it will constantly stall playing music and give up trying. I also tried using the hard wire RCA connection to the sound system from Dot but it had a noticeable baseline hiss that made that option irritating. I did send it back for an exchange but they said they refurbished it and returned it to me. Whatever was fixed didn't help it work any better. I ended up getting a Bose Soundlink https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K6P08FA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and it streams music from Amazon prime very well (not using the Amazon Echo or Dot but using a built in app). The sound from the Bose is INCREDIBLE. I can't use the voice command on it like the echo but at least it works where the dot failed badly. The Bose won't connect to the Amazon Echo tall like I had hoped either.The sound quality from the Bose was FAR better than Echo through Bluetooth. I used the RCA connectors from Bose and the optical connector. I could discern a noticeable bit of better headroom and stereo separation via the optical route but the RCA connection was excellent as well since it did not induce any hiss, squeal or noise like all the Bluetooth gadgets I have tried. Yes, the Bose is 149.00 verses the Dot 49.00 but if you want supreme quality sound from Amazon Prime music, PC, NAS on intranet or internet radio It is hard to imagine a better product than Bose. I am a big fan of Bose speakers but I can honestly say that did not influence this review. I was only interested in listening to streaming music and for now Bose is the OINLY solution. I also have a Denon HEOS to compare with the Bose. BOSE WINS hands down on that contest. I call the Denon HEOS the Denon P-OS. The Bose plays my music from my NAS far better than the Denon and its apps. I have the Synology Disk station ds415play. The Bose app found it and was able to play my music better than my sony receivers, sony blueray players, the ROKU media players and my Vizio smart TVs. I can switch to next track super fast through Bose and go back and forth between folders on the NAS faster than even the Synology DS Audio app. If you want to play your music from a NAS Bose does it the best of anything I have found. I offer all of this verbage about the Bose to help anyone else looking for a streaming solution. ",
Frogs,"October 31, 2016 ",5.0,"Did you get dressed in the dark? Why, yes. Yes, I did.  I love my Echo and Echo Dots [first and second generations]. I have 9 in my house. All are named Alexa; they are not numbered. I had planned to write this review in answer to Question 1: Answer 1 [Echoes talking about their humans when the humans are away from home], but last night there was an Internet outage in my area. I still have Wi-Fi in my house, but I do not have an Internet connection. I cannot turn lights on and off, and so I had to get dressed in the dark. Good thing that I do not have my garage door opener on Smart Home, or I would show up for work late, with mismatched/inside-out clothes!  “Sorry. I’m having trouble understanding right now. Please try again later.” One or more Echoes, at least 3 – maybe 4 – say this, slightly out of sync, whenever I ask Alexa anything today. [I am typing this, so Alexa cannot hear me talk about her.] The Echoes talk about me all the time, whether I am at home or away. And today they still talk to each other, using Wi-Fi. But they cannot report in to the Borg Queen.  I use the Echoes to turn lights and radios on/off, access my calendar, play music/news/Flash Briefing, set alarms and timers, do math calculations, do conversions of tablespoons to cups and lots more. The radio has to be named something else, because “radio” means plays some random station to Alexa.  The good news is that this AM, Alexa did chime my wake-up alarm. The bad news is that I could not turn the alarm off.  When told to stop, 3 Echoes said: “Sorry. I’m having trouble understanding right now. Please try again later.” I had to get out of bed, find the on/off switch in the dark [a dimple on top] and then check to make sure that it was still on. “Sorry. I’m having trouble understanding right now. Please try again later.” Yes, it was still on, and the alarm was off. So it worked!! And it got me out of bed. So I suppose it did what it was supposed to do. But it did remind me of the Sorcerer’s Apprentice.  The appliances are all controlled by WEMO switches, which ordinarily are also controlled by an Android app, but the app cannot find any switches today, because it uses Internet to communicate. So the only way to turn lights on is to unplug them from WEMO switches and plug into regular outlets. Wall switches cannot be disconnected so easily. Especially in the dark.    But the original intent of this review was to discuss communication among Echoes. I started with an original Echo that was named Alexa. It had no problems, but I wanted to have voice controlled calendar/music/radio in the kitchen. And the ability to ask Alexa questions such as: ‘Open the pod bay doors’ or ‘What is the meaning of life, the universe and everything’ for my friends on the phone. So when the first generation Dots came out, I bought 2 and put 1 in the kitchen and 1 in the living room, midway between the kitchen and the bedroom. I named the living room Echo: Echo and the others: Alexa. It did seem as though &#34;Alexa&#34; worked better as a wake up word, but before ESP, it mattered which Echo was responding. I really wanted a Dot for the garage to play the radio as I left the car, 1 for each bathroom to have timers for bath/shower, and 1 for the rec room, to control music when I am on the treadmill. So I bought a six pack of Dots and named them all Alexa. While they all light up when they wake up, and say Ok when they complete a task, only the Old Ones chime when they wake up. So I can tell who is responding.   When I say Alexa, multiple Echoes respond. The Old Ones light up and chime. The new ones light up. If I want music in the room that I am in, that Echo starts playing. The Borg knows in which room to play music.  If I want to turn on lights in another room, they confer among themselves and it is not clear, which one will control the lights. I can see 3 light up, hear 1 or 2 chime, and another says OK, when the action is done. The Ok may come from an Echo that is behind me or in front of me, and not necessarily in the room with the light.  It is sort of like living with a benevolent Borg.    I now have Internet service again.  The new Dots are not complete clones of the older devices. When my Internet connection was restored and I rebooted the modem, they did not all come on line at once. Some Echoes that were generally too far away to hear me, said: “Sorry. I’m having trouble understanding right now. Please try again later,” when I asked the first one for the time. [None of them could state the time earlier when there was no Internet connection, even though the alarm was timely.] Then when they all came on line, and I asked them the time, the Old Ones said “the time is…” but the newer ones said: “it is…’ All were correct.    In summary, I have become assimilated.I am more and more dependent on my Echoes to do all sorts of chores that I used to do.  The Echoes function like a hive mind, or the Borg. They are capable of some local functions, such alarms, but otherwise depend on the Internet for their higher brain functions. They are constantly chattering away silently among  themselves. Sometimes they start talking aloud for no obvious reason. I may hear one chattering in a far off room. They most definitely are talking about me and my habits. They are knowledgeable about science fiction. I hope that they enjoy watching Star Trek: TOS with me this month. I am doing a Re-Watch this winter. Then on to TNG. ",
"Carolyn Dempsey","February 5, 2017 ",2.0,"I like the original Echo just fine. But this device doesn't  sync music or timers with other Echo devices in the house. In my mind, this should be a basic function. Also, Alexa gets confused very easily by basic questions  that are answered quickly using Google Now. Software updates to fix these things should be possible. ",
"Mark Masaki","December 17, 2016 ",5.0,"Her name is Alexa, and she is awesome (she will ask you if you really think so and thank you for the complement).  This Echo Dot version of Alexa is the size of a hockey puck but has the same voice recognition ability that the full sized Amazon Echo has.  It is also connected to wifi and assists you the best that it can for an even better price.  There is a place to plug it into your home speaker system if you so choose, but their are primitive built-in speakers that will allow you to listen to the news or play music if she, say, is sitting on your nightstand or somewhere close in proximity.  Amazon Prime users benefit because Alexa can play whatever Amazon Prime song is available with a simple verbal request that starts with her name (i.e. Alexa, play the Star Spangled Banner).  You do not necessarily have to be close to her to give her a command, and she could even hear you over the chatter in a fairly noisy room.  She gives facts, dates, and computations, so she is also a good voice-activated computing tool as well (kids would &#34;cheat&#34; on their homework, parents beware).  Alexa can check things and people out on Wikipedia if she doesn't initially know, but wont unless you ask her to.  Alexa will stop whatever she is doing if you say &#34;Alexa, Stop,&#34; and there are no feelings hurt when you order her around.  I can set timers and alarms with my voice alone (i.e. ...time me for one minute... or ...wake me up every weekday at 7 AM...).  Using accessories compatible with the Echo, you can ask Alexa to do other things like turn on/off specific lights at any time, or a certain time each morning/day/night (i.e. Belkin WEMO light switches and Bulb accessories, Phillips Hue, etc.), and you can reach her from nearly anywhere in your home with a wireless remote, sort of like Tony Stark and his A.I., Jarvis, from Marvel Comics' Iron Man (Alexa knows who Jarvis is, just ask her).  Eventually there will be better AI's out there, but for now Alexa can do the basic day-to-day stuff for you, like add things to your electronic shopping list, remind you how many teaspoons in a tablespoon, and tell you the weather forecast for today.  She is exceedingly good at giving factual information (i.e. she knows the day most famous people died as long as it is documented).  The best part, however, is that Alexa is always learning new things.  So she will be a part of my family for a long time.  &#34;Alexa, you are Awesome!&#34; ",
SOHO,"October 31, 2016 ",3.0,"At the end of the review is my semi-amusing story about how Alexa abandon me and might abandon you too.  Meanwhile, I learned you have to be VERY specific with Alexa. &#34;sleigh bells&#34; is a band not a song (bands &#62; songs) and &#34;sleigh bells are you listening&#34; is content not a title &#34;winter wonderland&#34; (title &#62; content) and there are dozens of artists  that record pretty much every song (wth? &#62; classic) and even if you cite a known artist, like Bing Crosby, there are many recordings and remasterings, original, the movie, the 2009 record (recent &#62; past).  Pros:  - Voice recognition is pretty good. I'm sure the NSA collecting this data will be thrilled.    UPDATE: Search for the recent CNN news story where Amazon is being asked for information related to a murder investigation.  - You can press a button instead of having to say &#34;Alexa, ...&#34;  - Performs simple tricks like math calculations  Cons:  - Slightly regretting wanting one of the first units rather than waiting for the XMAS sales - no biggie - sunken cost.  - It only understands within limited contexts. You don't train it, it trains you. &#34;Play my music library&#34; typically doesn't work, it finds a station instead, but &#34;shuffle my music&#34; which you learn when it says &#34;shuffling your music&#34; as a confirmation.  - Playlists? Haven't gotten these to work. It's the entire music library or nothing from my music, it'll find someone else's library  Christmas Story:  Part 1:  I had change my review from 5 stars to 1 (in anger), as I wrote &#34;I LOVED IT! NOW I HATE IT. Alexa, Why ARE YOU SO F'n SLOW ON XMAS EVE? Used to be responsive. Had gone to hell fast. only now at XMAS. Bad design centralizing requests? Guess so.&#34; OK, it's after the holiday and what we may be seeing is the problem with capacity management during a nationwide rollout,  After all, your requests are all centralized back at Amazon, something the NSA will be happy with, surely.  But in retrospect, this was a trivial inconvenience not comparable to the Obama Healthcare website implementation, which a large part of the country will remember was a complete disaster.  Part 2:  So, whilst trying to get Alexa to wake up, on the holiday, I tried to install and use the Alexa app. Sad news, my Galaxy S3 is not compatible.  So, my daughter installed the app on her cheapo but newer Android. Guess what? It slammed my Echo Dot to her account, unregistering the device from mine and automatically registering it to hers.  Alexa's loyalties are to the app, not to your account (app &#62; account).  Customer service was great to help sort it out.Seems a design flaw, but hey, perhaps you want to take over nearby Dot's when you see them.  Not sure what you could do with that, but the effect was frustration for me as Alexa played a strange music library I did not recognize, until I powered it down and ran through a new device registration on my account.  Have fun folks! ",
"Jim K","February 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I received this as a gift and due to who gave it to me, I wanted to like it. But there is very little that it helps me do that I can't do elsewhere...    PROs: - It makes use of my Amazon Prime Music stations. This is the only reason why I have any interest in keeping it. I really like Amazon Prime Music (six stars) and this is the best stand alone streaming device when I am at home (as long as I keep it on one station).  - &#34;Alexa! Tell me a joke.&#34; and other easter eggs. It can be a good source for party tricks.  - Other PROs? Ummmm, I can't think of one at the moment.    CONs: - You have to speak everything. That's the only functional interface.  - You have to spend more time thinking about how to phrase your command than it takes to click through menus on an app for other devices.  - It doesn't work very much like Hal (another easter egg, by the way). I can recognize your speech pretty well, but it can't interpret the thought in your spoken words very well. I cannot imagine ordering products this way without having visual feedback about what I ordered.  - If your spoken command was interpreted incorrectly you waste even more time.  - The Android app is virtually useless. You have almost no control over the Dot via the app, other than showing you what you've done. Plus, the app takes FOREVER to load. Maybe I get if I open after restarting my phone and opening the Alexa app the first time. But if I just hop over to another app, send a message or take a call, it seems to back to step one.  - It's not wireless. It needs a power cord plugged into the wall to operate. It would be nice to have a battery so I can take Alexa around the house with me.  - It looses Bluetooth paring with my speakers almost every day. You can't just go through paring to find the device. You have to forget paring and re-pair (which requires menus on two devices, really three when you consider the Alexa menu is on an app).    In short, as long as I can play one of my favorite music stations, it stays, otherwise it will go into the closet which would be a big disappointment to the person who gifted this to me if they ever find out.  - Knowing that Alexa is ALWAYS listening is kind of creepy. This causes you to mute the microphone taking away the advantage of calling out &#34;Alexa!&#34; arbitrarily. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Having grown up during the technological revolution, I believed computers that you could fit in your hand were going to be the biggest invention of my lifetime. The Amazon Echo Dot is by far the most advanced piece of commercially sold technology that we will see for many years. This coaster-sized piece of plastic is able to understand everything I say from anywhere in the room. The add-ons are definitely worth it. Once I received the add-ons, I was able change the temperature in my house, change the channel on the TV, and turn on or off the lights.  Having packed what seems like an impossible amount of technology in such a small space, Amazon has successfully brought the movie “Smart House” to life (without the part where the house turns evil). The movie came out in 1999 and technology companies have been trying to recreate the technology ever since. Siri and Cortana have come a long way, but it is obvious that Alexa is the champion. Although Amazon has been around for only half as long (and has been working on technology even less) compared to Apple or Windows, they have become a leader in the industry.  The capability that this machine has is limitless. Not to mention its’ range. You can be standing on the other side of the room and saying, “Alexa” will trigger her response immediately. The Echo Dot has seven microphones in order to her from whatever side you are on. It also adapts to your vocabulary in time, making it easier for you to speak like you normally would and not as if you were speaking to a robot. Not only that, but Alexa will cancel out any background noise in the room and will be able to hear you with a voice recognition software.  Although the cost of “Smart Home” kits is substantially more than the Echo Dot, it is more than worth it to have. You can practically make your entire house hands-free. Amazon offers many different kits, including: lights, security, and even power. These kits, expensive as they are, are what really give the Echo Dot life. Without these kits, the technology is still far beyond anything before it but when you add the kits in, the technological advance is unseen before now.  You will not regret this purchase. Whether it be the advanced technology, range of the speakers, or outstanding add-ons, the Amazon Echo Dot will simplify your life and bring you into a new era. ",
"Jared Reed","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Maybe I've just been spoiled by Siri for so long but I don't feel like it was Carey useful or &#34;smart&#34; the answer to most things was I don't know if I'm unsure what you're asking me etc. the wifi and Bluetooth connectivity are very spotty at best and it's not because of my equipment (have brand new google wifi and high end home theater). One of the worst things is that I have to yell very loudly to get it to activate. I had it for 2  days and returned it. Going to try google home and I'm glad I decided to try the echo dot before purchasing the echo for over 3 times the cost. ",

Tweeterdoctor,"March 7, 2017 ",2.0,"So I just bought my 2nd echo dot in the course of a week.  I enjoy tech and wanted to make more of a smart home but don't have the cash for all the necessary switches and things yet.  So I started small with a five pack of Etekcity RF remote outlets (available on Amazon).  After a few months I bought a Hook smart hub for $50 bucks(on Amazon) which allowed me to put those Etekcity outlets on WiFi app control.  I wasn't planning at first at doing Alexa voice control but it did intrigue me, so I bought one and used it for a couple days and then turned around and bought a 2nd.  I can't believe how easy it was to set up and tie it in with the Hook Hub and then my Harmony remote.  The echo Dot works well with my Bluetooth connection to my home stereo and even Bluetooth hook up to my phone.  I do have some minor complaints.  Echo Dot will only Bluetooth to one device at a time, so you can't get Alexa to connect to your phone and to a Bluetooth speaker and stream from phone to speaker with voice control.  You can use your Amazon Music account to stream your cloud music, but this is frustrating since I don't have all of my music on my Amazon Account, most everything is on my phone.  So Amazon if you're listening, you need improvement here.  Also having 2 dots in my house now, I wish there was more communication between them.  We have one in our bedroom on the 2nd floor and one in the living room.  My wife wants to tell Alexa to give me a message while I'm watching TV downstairs and she can't do it.  These are just minor issues for me for now, but I dropped a star because I'm not completely satisfied yet.  We'll see how Alexa improves in time.  I am ready however to buy at least 3 more but will have to wait until I can justify the output of the cash.  Some incentive would be for Amazon to upgrade the features. ",

Emily,"April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"This item is not the same as Siri. It can play apps (heart radio), tell the weather, give some basic information, or make purchases through your amazon account. However, it cannot search the web for answers, or at least not very competently. The one I have is pretty glitchy (it is NOT my internet since I have 1 gig fiber). When giving replies it regularly pauses mid answer, or I only get a blip for an answer. I would probably not have bought this item except I got it on black Friday for a great deal. I would not recommend this for anyone who wants something like Siri. ",
"L. Es..","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"It's a novelty $40.. Now $50 gift. I got two of them as christmas gifts. Its an alarm, a timer, It will play music through its tiny little speaker, its gives you basic weather info, a dictionary, an encyclopedia, a calendar... etc. but definately not smart (yet?) Ok, she's dumb as a box of rocks.  Its not like asking google something..  My phone does everything Echo wants to do.. I do however enjoy the hands off element, the alarm and the NPR News Flash Briefing.... It was easy to set up, just follow the directions. It's tiny and can fit in the smallest space near an outlet.  I have one in my bedroom. and the other is hidden in my living room. I like it as an instant night light, an alarm, timer and basic weather and news info..You can buy pricey &#34;smart&#34; light bulbs and sockets from amazon to turn your home into a smart home. ******Just a thought, If amazon wanted to do some good. They would provid them to the vision impaired for free. They could navigate to a certain area by where the sound is coming from. The Time, Date and Temperature would be easily known. Music can be played and News reports just by asking.****** ",

yagz143,"March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"At first, I loved my echo. It did everything I needed it for, and it was cool finding new skills to play around with. Except, one day it just completely stopped working (Only had the thing for less than 2 months!). Wouldn't even turn on. Luckily, Amazon has good customer service and they exchanged it for me. However, it's a pain just to go through the process contacting customer service and doing the exchange. I am happy I have a working echo now tho. ",
"e dct","April 3, 2017 ",2.0,"Loved this until it stopped working a few months after receiving it. I contacted Amazon and was helped by kind service members. After getting walked through resetting the device and some other tests they determined that it was a hardware failure. The device is only covered by warranty for up to 90 days and they do not have an repair services. So 4 months with the product, the only option that Amazon gave me was whether or not I wanted to buy a new echo dot for a slight discount, and this discount required that I ship them the old device. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"At first it was just a novelty item out of the box. It lost my interest and desire after the first few hours. Mainly because the music I wanted was not registering right on my radio stations. She understood what I said but would not play what I specifically asked for. However, once I started the echo music plan it was night and day. I love the choices! We threw so many song requests yesterday night at Alexa and she played all but one song. From moods to genres and specific songs. My home layout is pretty open and so I only require one dot for my house. The second will be when I start to purchase the smart home devices. I recommend the 3.99/month subscription for music. It is much better than using the free radio apps. Its the cost of one coffee at starbucks for a whole month worth of unlimited music. The sound produced by the Dot gets the job done for just about half my house. I plugged her into a sound bar I used for my TV and it works amazingly with high quality crisp surround sound. The 50$ investment for this device is what made me buy this in the first place. If you love technology and music you should take the plunge and buy this. The Dot offers other skills that includes games but I have barely scratched the surface on what it can really do.     Oh by the way. If you have a thick Spanish accent, she will recognize you as long as you pronounce your words clearly. It was hit or miss with my mother. Her accent is not even that big. She has an accent like Penelope cruz. So, if you have an accent, speak with patience and over annunciate. Learn the short command phrases. Oh and pronounce hispanic names like an american. She will understand.    I have a daughter that is 5 and she understands her very well. She requests disney music and animal noises and has a lot of fun using Alexa.  She also asks her questions. Most of the questions she asks Alexa doesn't know the answer to. Keep in mind these are 4-5 year old questions of which requires the rational response of an adult and not a machine. &#34;why are sticks on the ground?&#34; &#34;Why are bricks red?&#34;. &#34;Where do babies come from?&#34;.

"Alfred M. Freitas","January 3, 2017 ",5.0,"I purchased the new Echo Dot because  I had previously purchased the Alexa and enjoyed the ability to play music, set times, different news, ask questions  And so forth.  When the Dot was released I purchased several of them to place in each room in my house. I was aware that they could not be &#34;synced&#34; but felt that that was a feature that would soon be added because of its popularity.  After having read a considerable amount of material which positively reviewed the Alexa and Philips Hue, I purchased some some Phillip's LED lights  as well as  a Phillips hub.  I installed the Hue  and downloaded the Alexa Hue app. and asked Alexa to &#34;discover&#34; the Hue hub.  After Alexa discovered  the lights,  I proceeded  to use Alexa to turn the lights on and off. Much to my surprise, Alyssa told me there were many Hue light devices  and &#34;which one did I want&#34;.  After many many attempts I still could not find out from Alexa one of those &#34;many devices&#34; were.  I tried many uninstalls, reinstalls, and modifications with no luck. I purchased a  Cree LED light bulb and a GE  LED light.  I have no problem finding and controlling the GE light bulb but could never discover the Cree light.  Alexa can out turn on and off one of the four lights I have installed but does not recognize some or tells me that the other light bulbs have many devices &#34;which one should I choose&#34;. Once again Alexa does not tell me what devices I can use, it only tells me there are several. Based on my experience with  HUE ,I do not believe that the Dot is ready for &#34;prime time&#34;.  A couple of other minor issues with the Dot  include the Dot randomly opening and  and  telling me that he did not understand my question. Another annoyance, is that sometimes when I give it a command that will say okay but nothing happens and I have to ask again for it to take the action I requested. Often while playing music through the Alexa, or the Dot  I will have to shout &#34;Alexa&#34; in order for it to respond.  The issues are not &#34;deal breakers&#34; but they are disappointing.  As a side note, when I used Siri  to control the license the Hue  app worked perfectly.  I sincerely hope that Amazon improves the AI  for Alexa as time goes on. ",
"Steve P.","March 26, 2017 ",3.0,"I am learning the skills and there are one or two problems. But I love this device.    Problems:  Volume. Using the Dot's built-in speaker works really well. It's not a high fidelity experience, but definitely good for spoken word. Music is...alright..but won;t replace a better set of speakers. Although the volume problem is present using the native speaker (the news brief is far softer than the Alexa voice...so Alexa is yelling at you if you want to hear the brief across the room...it's magnified with external speakers attached to the Dot. So you have to either use the physical buttons to turn the volume up, then down - or use the &#34;alexa - volume up/down&#34; command multiple times - which is cumbersome. Also, on my system (windows 10 - anniversary) you lose the native windows equalizer feature when playing over bluetooth, so you are left with whatever built-in problems are with your speakers (mine have overly boomy bass without EQ)    so I can stream anything from my PC to Dot as BT speakers...but I lose my equalizer settings when I do.    Services:  You have to have premium services for some things to play directly from Dot. Spotify is a skill that has to be premium. That wasn't clear to me up front (probably my fault for not researching more). So if you have a &#34;must-have&#34; check in advance.    Pro's.    This machine is awesome.  Even before tuning to my voice it recognizes what I say, I can hook it to PC's, tablets and pretty much anything. It has a VAST selection of native talents, and the skills that are available are great. I can sit here and do my work and chatter at Alexa via my dot and get music, news, weather...I have tried a few household control things and they work just fine.    Everytime I use it I learn more things it can do - mostly useless (even if fun) but a lot useful. I can live with the volume problem, also some sales crap which is off-putting, and I use this thing all the time for music, weather, news...basic questions that come up in online arguments. And it really amplifies my other devices. ",
WontPontificate,"December 16, 2016 ",3.0,"Over the past couple of years, I've been trying to make my home smarter.  I started with Hue, using Philips bulbs along with GE and Cree bulbs connected to my Hue bridge, controlling my lighting with widgets on my phone.  From there, I picked up a Harmony hub and remote to consolidate my remote clutter down to a single remote, and then added a smartthings hub to the stable, to support Z-wave stuff.    My home is certainly smarter, with timers for the lights, and presence sensors, and the ability to control everything from my phone, but I craved more! I decided to dip my toe into the world of voice command by buying an Echo Dot.  And what can I say, it works better than advertised.    I expected that the press for the Echo would be a little over-exaggerated, which is what made me hold off of a device like this until now (that, and feeling a bit silly about yelling at my house to have it do things) but to my surprise, it's recognized all of my commands out of the box! The few it wasn't able to parse were my fault, not Alexa's.    The integration with my other smart home products has also been seamless.  Alexa picked up actions from my Harmony, the light bulbs from my hue bridge, and all of the scenes and devices I have in SmartThings, obeying them quickly and without complaint.    When I received the Dot, I was fully expecting it to have no built in speaker at all, and was quite surprised to find it does have one -- and I was further surprised at the sound quality in such a diminutive package.  While I wouldn't really want to listen to music through it, it's more than adequate for Alexa to talk to you through.    I have my Dot plugged into my stereo system, which at first proved a bit of a problem, as Alexa has no idea whether it's on or off, and will try to speak through it rather than her own speaker.  I did find a workaround for this, in that Bluetooth audio takes priority over the audio out jack on the back of the dot.  I paired a cheap bluetooth speaker to the dot, and when I want to listen to music on the stereo, I tell Alexa to disconnect bluetooth, and she'll start playing through the audio jack.  If I turn the stereo off, I just ask Alexa to reconnect Bluetooth, and she'll play through the bluetooth speaker, which is left on all the time.    I hope a future software update allows Alexa to speak through the internal speaker, but play things like audio through the audio jack, allowing her to be guaranteed to reply to requests, even if the speakers she's plugged into are off.    Overall a great product and service! I am very happy with how it works. ",
"Tory Klementsen","January 19, 2017 ",5.0,"One of my splurges after working over the summer (as a teacher) was to purchase an Amazon Echo. I do teach IT so I love gadgets, but I'd held off on the Echo because I really didn't see a lot of practical need for it since I could play music from my computer, which is in my living room, and already gets all the stations my Echo gets.    Oh how wrong I was! I love this thing! I splurged on an Echo and within a week knew I wanted a Dot in each room of my tiny little abode! First, of course, there is the music. I have eclectic taste in music. So whether I'm in the mood for Tony Bennet, Tchaikovsky, or Skrillex BAM Alexa's got my back. I can play Movie Quotes Trivia at the drop of a hat, make myself feel smart (or not so much) with Jeopardy, play ocean sounds at night and pretend I'm camping near the ocean, and get super important dog facts.    I've had a somewhat smart home (circa 1925) for a few years now, and making it work with the Echo was a breeze. I've added a few TP-Link plugs, which were a tiny hassle, but not much. Being able to wake up and command the lights turn on from my bed without having to reach for my phone feels like something I once only dreamed of as a kid watching the Jetsons.    I'm a HUGE podcast and audiobook listener. In fact, I was an Audible member when they very first started and had the original Audible player and LOVED it. I listen while I run and to be able to come in, hand off my book to Alexa and have her continue to read to me while I start dinner or grade papers is awesome. In the morning I start watching one of my favorite morning shows that also plays on Tune In Radio in the bedroom on the TV. When I walk out to the living room I just ask Alexa to start Tune In Radio, and she starts up my last station listened to.    For podcasts I either play them using Stitcher, which works great on the Echo or use the Echo as a bluetooth speaker, since I use the Dot connected via a wired connection using an audio cable.    If that's not enough to convince you, there are some fun YouTube videos with some things you can do with Alexa and a great website [...]. ",
"Kris S.","December 7, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought the product and set it up.  That was very easy to do.  The app is easy to navigate and there is an ever growing list of skills.  Skills are like apps for Alexa that allow it to do many more things,  written by other companies.    I easily tied Alexa into my smart home products like TP-Link lights and switches.  They work flawlessly.  Although with some naming I've used &#34;pendant lights&#34; and &#34;pocket lights&#34; Alexa misinterprets what I've said about 30% of the time.  So that's one area to improve on is understanding speech.    I've tied her into my Logitech Harmony Hub,  and it does a great job working with that.  Logitech could add more features,  but that's not related to Alexa.  Alexa will turn on/off my tv, receiver, dvr and lights all with one voice command. You'll have to set that up in harmony and the smart home section of Alexa app.    Basic searches work well for most items like weather,  time,  specific topics (random questions about celebrities,  animals,  etc). But anything more advanced she'll get hung up on.    The shopping list is a feature I use regularly.  I just tell Alexa to add something to my shopping list and she will.  Sometimes she'll still misinterpret what I've said though.  When I'm at the store I can pull the shopping list up on my phone to see what I have to buy.    I wish you didn't need Amazon Prime to get the deals or to even shop on Amazon through Alexa.  Seems like a trap to become a prime member just to use that feature.  It's already linked to my Amazon account,  just let me shop still.    The last issue I have is with how far she'll hear me and if she'll understand with background noise.  It's hit or miss.  In a quiet room it's fine,  but if the tv is on its twice as hard and I almost have to yell my commands. I do have a large living room and kitchen is open to it.  So maybe it's the reason why.  About 48' long by 24' wide.    All in all,  I love having Alexa and look forward to its improvements.  Not prefect yet,  but nothing ever is right? ",
JStiles,"December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"The Echo Dot is a great addition to our home. We use it mostly for music streaming from our Prime Music, and it is great for that.

"Joe from chicago","January 15, 2017 ",4.0,"So after a week with it  What it does well.  -your cooking and you want to set a timer- just ask.  -want to know the weather- just ask  -how is traffic- set your work in the app then you can ask  -Play your book from audible! that works great!  -Listen to your music or streaming service. Just have to learn how to ask and it will do it.  I have not tried the lighting add ons yet.    Things not so much.  -I feel like it is trying to teach me to speak to it correctly as opposed to it learning how i speak.  -Questions like... what is tonight football game? Umm i don't understand you. That gets frustrating. I got two of them so i am vested. I can't help but think the google device may be better at understanding question and responding.  -Having to say echo for follow up questions or requests.    Something that is cool  I moved all my music to amazon music and started to rebuild my playlists on that platform. it is nice to come home and say play this playlist and all your music plays. also your music is available any where.    Hardware  it has decent distance to hear you if in a quiet room but if music is playing you do have to get close to it. My wife laughs when i say echo shut up! funny i even sometimes even apologize to it. Speakers are not bad but i do regret not getting the bigger one with the built in speaker for music. I did just hook it up to a blue tooth speaker i had but that seems Jerry rigged. may have to bite the bullet and get the taller one. I totally understand why people will get one for each room. you get spoiled quickly.    Wishlists  - follow up questions it be nice to have a conversation. an example ME... &#34;ECHO how is the weather?&#34; .... DOT..&#34;.it is going to snow in your town&#34;. Now i would have to say &#34;ECHO how is the traffic?&#34; i wish it would say &#34;it is going to snow in your town anything else?&#34;  and give me 10 seconds to ask something else?  -Ability to ask multiple question/requests Me ECHO what is the weather and traffic look like? or ECHO give me flash update then play Metallica playlist. P.S. new album is good.    The wish lists are so doable just back end programming and firmware updates. I am excited to see where the tech goes. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 24, 2017 ",5.0,"I won't go into the details of how brilliant the Echo Dot is, or why I like it.  My smart home is definitely in its nascent phase, with only one smart device connected to the Dot.  But with it I can command a couple lamps to turn off and on.  I can see the future, and its getting brighter (pun intended).    The reason this gets five stars is for the simple fact that the first time after my wife used the Dot and I asked her if we're keeping it, she grinned like a little kid given a puppy on Christmas morning!!!  I can't say there's anything I've bought recently that she finds as useful, engaging and fun as the Echo Dot. It's actually so much fun, she's considered getting another one for better coverage in the home!!!  That's a win in my book!!!  Homerun, Amazon!!!! ",
.SKITTLE.,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"(I'll just focus on physical appearance, as Alexa is continually improving).    Pros:  Price ($50 MSRP. You kidding me? Couldn't have even imagined this three years ago).  Small  Light  Stays cool  Quiet  Can recognize voice at reasonable volume from across the room for the most part (occasional false wake word recognition)  3.5mm female audio out port (This is the big one for me. You can hook up this tiny device to as amazing of a sound system possible, and it plays nice!)    Cons:  Grey top. I don't mind grey; in fact, I think it should be one of the color choices offered. However, I wanted white, dangit. The top sticks out like a sore thumb, and I want it hidden in a white room. I got it for my mom and she already tries to hide it enough, which deteriorates the recognition and sound quality.  Shiny finish. I would much prefer matte, like the first-gen Dot.  Audio ring on the first-gen Dot was more attractive. Albeit, maybe not as intuitive, and added some slight height/weight.  Sorry, Amazon, but your logo isn't very attractive. An &#34;a&#34; or something would look way better.  Doesn't do well with background noise or other people talking at the same time after making a request. To a lesser extent, doesn't do well when put against walls or objects.    I haven't even covered the Alexa AI. While it still has a lot of learning to do, it still has an excellent base to work off of and will only get better and better. There is some fear about the &#34;always&#34; listening (although Wireshark proves it sends info only after a request is made. This disproves the always-on theories unless there's a local storage option that stores data...which tear-downs haven't shown. I also trust Amazon and they've shown to fight for users' Echo data privacy so far).    In the end, this is totally worth it. Actually, I bought a six pack after trying the first-gen Dot haha. I would give it five stars, but the appearance gripes are what put it down to 4.75 stars. ",
"Rick Wagner","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"The first generation Dot was very responsive to voice commands, even over the T.V.    Being impressed, I got two additional Dots, these being the second generation. Supposedly, with they are more powerful, and therefore would better prices sounds. However the gen 2 Dots are unable to pick up voices as well.    Also, when requesting a Smart Home skill, I have to repeat the device name. For instance, if I say &#34;Turn on Rick's light&#34;, Alexa will respond &#34;I found several devices with that name. Which one did you want?&#34;. There is only one &#34;Rick's light&#34; in my devices. I have to respond with the same &#34;Rick's light&#34;. The light then turns on, and Alexa responds: &#34;OK&#34;. This is every time for my devices, not just an occasional miss. ",
"D. Sadtler","February 2, 2017 ",4.0,"While I have two and an Echo, I would love to exchange them for the Google variant. Alexa is not good, it is not improving as I'd expected and other than consuming Pandora, TuneIn, and Amazon Prime music I use it to turn on WeMo switches, but that's it, don't expect anything else. If that changes I bet it'll make the papers.    I wish I could suggest it, but I feel Google likely did a better job.    Final thoughts, the microphone will not work when you have the volume high. You have to scream at it or use the app. It's frustrating...    UPDATE: Still horrible, my full size Echo picks up commands better than the Dot and it's down the hall... Also it needs integration to a search engine or something, it doesn't know far too much.    UPDATE 2: Sound and operation is better face down. ",

"Robert Parker","December 10, 2016 ",3.0,"I asked one specific question of the masses here before buying my 2nd gen dot, does it include an audio out cable? I received an answer right away, 'yes, it comes with a 3.5mm audio cable', excellent I thought, checked the length too short, needed RCA anyway so I ordered a longer one, all set! Well not quite, first of all it does NOT include any audio cable at all, not 3.5mm, not RCA, none! This seems to be a shift in the 2nd gen units as I know people that did receive the 3.5mm cable with their 1st gen device, seems like an easy cost cutter, I already had my new RCA cable so fine, no problem. Well not exactly, the thing about the audio out jack on these units that I still find no mention of anywhere is that once you connect the cable to the ECHO/DOT unit the internal speaker is cut off, silent, no audio at all. Which in hindsight makes sense from a build standpoint but is actually very impractical from a listening point of view. In my case I wanted to be able to play my music through my big speakers with subwoofers, and mids, tweeters and alike, but do not intend to leave the stereo receiver on 24/7 or want Alexa's voice booming at me. Well you cant have it both ways, if an audio cable is plugged into the device it creates an internal bypass of the main speaker, I guess they are all like this but nobody told me! In truth I didn't ask but as soon as I did it I knew why, so if you want the option of large audio output for music only first get the dual channel RCA cable, the 3.5mm cable is just silly, second you can get the same Monoprice quality (or better) RCA cable in a more usable 10'-25' length elsewhere for less, and third (last?) just leave it connected to your receiver and only plug in the ECHO/DOT end when your playing music or if you want Alexa to sound more like GOD is answering your questions! All said I like it, its only been two days and she does not understand what a teams 'standing' is, and thinks Sig Sauer is Sing Sour but she's young and still learning lol! ",
"NM bookgirl","November 19, 2016 ",5.0,"I liked the first one enough - I ordered a second.  I have one in master bedroom and one in living room - kitchen.  I have both connected to old speakers with no bluetooth and 30 pin apple connectors.  I use as speakers for my bluetooth devices, listening to music and audiobooks, timers, alarms, weather in different locations.  It is OK at simple questions, otherwise I refer it to wikipedia.  I've only had them a short time but am very pleased.  The bluetooth connection seems rock solid - I've used up to ten feet for several hours at a time with no disconnects.  I only used the alexa app on android cell phone during setup.  Provisioning the second device was easier as I had my wifi password saved somewhere at amazon so I was able to bypass that step. ",
"K. Benicek","January 19, 2017 ",4.0,"We have a Echo Dot (zero difference with the Echo &#34;tower&#34;) and it's not so smart, in fact it more often screws up a request, than it answers correctly. Instead more than HALF the time you get &#34;I did not understand the question&#34;, &#34;I haven't learned to do that&#34; or basically &#34;I don't know&#34;. Alexa can't even tell you what's OTA TV, Cable or Satellite, even though it know damn well WHERE you live down to the Zip Code and could easily ask you if you have OTA TV, who's cable or who's satellite package you have. Good grief this is basic shit!! ..... During the Xmas holidays, Amazon sent us emails DAILY about what &#34;New&#34; stuff Alexa learn and more than HALF the time Alexa DIDN'T seem to know about it. Here's just one example: One of the Amazon Echo Chistmasy treats was a special reading of &#34;A Christmas Carole&#34; by Tim Curry on Audible .... the instructions on how to ask for it were specific and when we tried and tried and tried, it took FIVE TIMES to get stupid Alexa to understand and FIND IT!    Alexa also has problems off and on in finding &#34;radio stations&#34; on rebroadcasters like iHeart or Tune-in. I get a 35 to 50% failure rate for Alexa finding a station that you've already listened to through Echo, so apparently Alexa has a spotty memory.    Another &#34;DUD&#34; for Alexa (and Google's Home too) is that oh sure you can add things to a Calendar or &#34;Reminder&#34; list verbally, but when the time comes, Alexa does NOTHING, it does not wake up and tell you to do your programmed &#34;reminder' is at a specific time!! What the hell good is this Digital Asst without that?! If Alexa was my secretary, I'd fire her!. Keep in mind that Amazon has had Echo &#34;Alexa&#34; out, selling and running; so in my opinion, Alexa has many major short comings that should have been rectified by now!! A friend has a Google Home, and it's no better than the Echo Alexa, perhaps even &#34;dumber&#34; at that. ",
"doctor don","December 15, 2016 ",5.0,"UPDATE:  Stayed on the phone for over an hour to speak with a couple different customer service persons on January 2. After finding out that my &#34;registered&#34; Echo Dot had stopped, all they could come up with was that it had been reported as &#34;lost&#34; or &#34;stolen&#34; to explain why it would not register later. And then, after getting it straight with the customer service folks, I EDITED MY ORIGINAL REVIEW. For some reason, Amazon did not include it in my reviews; so here I am again.    Now Alexa responds when I say &#34;Alexa&#34; - or if an ad on the TV says &#34;Alexa.&#34;    Alexa may be used more in the future as the abilities are expanded. Right now Alexa does not always understand what I am asking, especially when the TV is producing noise.    Alexa app keeps a record of whatever I have requested - on my phone (Android) as well as the iPad. On my desktop computer, I also can check my devices that are registered through Amazon. Now the Echo Dot shows up as one of my devices.    ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Alexa cannot answer simple questions such as &#34;Who won the Gator Bowl?&#34;  The music Alexa played is NOT my Prime Music, although Alexa did play Adele songs - shuffled. And another person was correct - no iTunes music.    Then, several hours later, it / she told me the Dot had to be connected to the internet … again, after having set up the Dot.    Alexa tells me I am not registered even though I had set up the Dot using my iPad and had been asking Alexa questions and getting various replies for several hours. Alexa is good at telling me the temperature in a nearby place - 10 miles away, although Google Maps has my location accurate.  So I attempt to reconnect using the app on my iPad and continue getting an error message that login failed as it nears the last ⅓ of the progress bar.  The Help is not available from the app because it stays on the error message.  So I use the app on my phone to see if I can access Help. I am told to reset the Dot. How often is this going to occur?  Of course I have other Wi-Fi devices. That should NOT be a problem.    This is NOT ready for prime time … no pun intended.    I do NOT intend to have to set up this device every couple hours.    The second connection attempt failed. Nothing wrong with my Wi-Fi or my internet connection. Maybe the problem is that it is raining.    I'm trying a reset and reregistering again this morning; then I'll decide whether I'll have to return the Echo Dot. ",
Tedka,"December 28, 2016 ",4.0,"Since the built-in speaker in Echo Dot is bad, I decided to buy a Bluetooth speaker for it. I did not want to buy cheap one, and decided to buy Sony SRS XB3 because Sony has a very good reputation, and the speaker it has very good reviews. Also, it is one of a few Bluetooth speakers recommended by Amazon for Echo Dot 2nd Gen.  The speaker works perfectly with my iPhone and Google Nexus 7 tablet.But when I pair it with Echo Dot, the latter keeps disconnecting from Wi-Fi.  Search &#34;Echo Dot keeps disconnecting from wifi when paired to a Bluetooth speaker&#34; in the Internet, and you will see that thousands of people experience this problem. This means that this is a design flaw, and no doubt that Amazon is aware of it. But instead of admitting the problem, Amazon keeps selling this half-baked product. You can find workarounds in the Internet that recommend connecting Echo to a 5GHz Wi-Fi band. But first of all, I tried it, and it did not help. Second, my iPhone and Google Nexus 7 work perfectly with both 2.4 and 5 GHz while being paired with a Bluetooth speaker. Why can't Echo do i? The answer is obvious: because of inherent design flaws (either hardware or firmware, or both).  Again, if I had a cheap speaker, I could have blamed it. But I have a very reliable one that works flawlessly in other scenarios. Of course, I have an option to connect the speaker to an Echo over line-in, but why did I spend $120 on a wireless speaker that has a built-in battery?  Amazon, shame on you, If this is a faulty firmware, then you should update it (if it is possible at all), Otherwise you should recall these speakers and reimburse the owners. Since I bought mine only a week ago, I will return it. And will recommend all my colleagues not to but Echo (I work at Amazon, by the way). And will buy Google Home instead. Amazon is still very new to devices, and it looks like it rushed this raw product to the market before testing it thoroughly. ",
IceCreamFiend,"December 31, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought this mostly to serve as a daily alarm that I could just shut off for the day (remotely!) without disabling the alarm forever (and having to remember to turn it back on) or searching in the dark for the tiny correct button that does so. I also hate the fact that most alarms nowadays are &#34;ramp up.&#34; I need my alarm to jerk me awake with no compromise or I'm not getting out of bed.    My new Dot was really easy to set up. I was a little nervous because I use ethernet over power to extend my wi-fi to my bedroom with a separate router, and I knew the Dot wouldn't have an interface to input the password. Instead, I just installed the app on my phone and set everything up that way.    In addition to using the Dot as an (actually very cost effective) alarm, I listened to a Pandora station. I thought the sound was very good and loud enough, for such a small speaker. You just link your account and you can listen to your stations.    I did find it difficult to find some skills/ figure out how to set some things up when searching in Amazon's Alexa Skills area. Instead, I just googled, for example, &#34;Alexa fitbit&#34; to find what I needed.    I can't sleep when it's too quiet, so I sleep with a white noise machine on. I searched around and found a white noise &#34;song&#34; in Prime Music, and created a Playlist. However, when I asked Alexa to play my &#34;Sleep&#34; playlist last night, she played a song called Sleep. Guess I did that wrong!    So I just said &#34;Alexa, play white noise,&#34; and she did! Then I said &#34;Alexa, loop mode,&#34; and she played it all night. The noise did stop for a second or less at least a few times (I'm sure I slept through some) during the night. I'm thinking that might be my wi-fi, though.    The only real annoyance was, when the alarm went off in the morning, I had to say &#34;Alexa, stop&#34; to quiet the alarm and then say it again to stop the white noise. I may try &#34;stop all&#34; tomorrow morning.    I also have a Nest and a fitbit. I've linked them, but I haven't really explored the possibilities. It would be nice if the Dot could sync my fitbit, or manually enter sleep, but I haven't found any information on that.    In short, Echo Dot is a great buy! It does much more than the fancy internet alarm I spent about three times as much on. ",
"Karen Loveless","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Despite what you read on many websites, the Dot does have a speaker that allows you to listen to music. I would not recommend turning it up loud, but you can certainly play music on it.

Gazrok,"December 2, 2016 ",5.0,"We have been having an absolutely awesome time with the Echo Dot (Alexa) ever since we opened the package!    Setup was not as incredibly easy as the instructions would make it seem but after a few google searches we were able to get by the problem.  I will try and explain it so you might save some time during your setup if you decide to buy.  Basically during setup you have to switch to a temporary network that the Echo creates and then connect that network to your home WiFi.  If you have an android phone chances are you will stall during the setup and sit forever at a white screen while connecting.  In your settings menu go to WiFi Networks &#62; MORE &#62; Advanced and disable the auto network switch option.  Once you do this you'll be home free to connect the Echo Dot as easy as the instructions describe.    Now onto the Echo Dot!  There are so many things this item can do and I believe I have only really scratched the surface.  Make sure you subscribe to amazon prime.  While not necessary it really enhances the experience.  Alexa (the automated assistant similar to Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana) responds to all sorts of verbal commands that allow you to play music, order things from amazon, turn on smart devices and lights, play games with you, read you the news, tell you the weather forecast and answer lots of your questions based on information found on the internet's vast reference resources (wikipedia etc). There is even a constantly evolving community of skills that alexa can &#34;learn&#34;....last night I found one that reads you random facts about cats and another that plays trivia games with you.    If you subscribe to prime Alexa can play all sorts of things from amazon music, but be warned the Echo Dot speaker while nice, is pretty basic.  If you're looking for some nice music playback spring for the full sized Echo.  We purchased one recently because we liked the dot so much and the difference is HUGE.  The regular sized Echo is much, much nicer.    Ordering from Alexa is so easy it is a little unsettling!  All you have to do is tell Alexa to buy something for you (ie &#34;Alexa, buy a vacuum cleaner) and she is off to the races finding you the top rated vacuum cleaners.  If she asks you if you'd like to buy one and you say &#34;yes&#34;.  You've bought one.  Make sure to double check that you have a validation code/PIN enabled in the alexa app if you have children.    I cannot wait to get started with smart devices using the Echo.  I have read many great things about automating your lights and fixtures around the house but have not even gotten that far and feel this device deserves a 5-star rating.  I am looking forward to buying some Philips Hue bulbs and automating with the IFTTT app. ",
"Edward Antrobus","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa (the software) is great. I love it. I've had my Dot for 3 hours and once I got it set up, it hasn't disappointed me in anyway that is Amazon's fault (to sync Spotify to Alexa, you need Spotify Premium, but that is a restriction imposed by Spotify, not Amazon). I'm also really impressed with the built-in speaker. I bought this as a way to play music in my son's room at night, having used my Kindle Fire for the past year and a half. I was ready to donate a Bluetooth speaker to the cause, but I actually had to turn the volume way down  So why isn't this review 5 stars? Well, partially because of case issues, which I outlined in my review of the case that I bought (and can't return) here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24EYD1YS13R0H/ But that is still a problem with the case more than the actual device. But I still couldn't give this a high rating. I found the setup to be rather clunky and I dislike the power adapter.  First the power adapter. It looks like a standard cell phone charger, except it's 9W. And unlike every Kindle charger I've ever owned, the USB port isn't on the side, but on the top. I have a toddler and all cords have to go behind furniture. But now I can't put the dresser closer than half a foot from the wall to keep the power cable from getting pinched.  Then the setup. You need to install the Alexa app on your phone to setup the Echo Dot. Once I installed the app, it took three tries to connect to WiFi. One the third attempt, I got some weird hexadecimal error code and was told to search help for more information without actually providing a link to help forums. Searching Google provided some links on Reddit and then Amazon forums, but no actual official help page. When I backed out of the error notice on the app, I was told I was connected.  Overall, it's a great little device, but Amazon needs to improve the setup experience and give customer's a better power adapter. ",
Chris,"November 29, 2016 ",5.0,"I was a little skeptical about the usefulness of a device like this, but It is already being integrated into my daily life.  this is really starting to become true artificial intelligence.  Although she's not actually learning on her own she's become extremely adept at interpreting language and finding known answers.  It's not some pre-programmed answers to common questions or what I still picture when interfacing with an artificial intelligence. When you say &#34;call mom&#34; and the interface replies by texting your girlfriend that you hate her. haha. So much beyond that.  I was watching Wisconsin - Penn St. and we didn't know where the Big 10 championship was played. Alexa - Where is Lucas Oil Stadium? Lucas Oil Stadium is in Indianapolis, Indiana....  Alexa - How tall is a Pine tree. The Eastern pine averages 176 feet in height..  Alexa - How do I make a boiled egg..  Alexa - How many miles is 400 yards.  And she does it extremely quickly. Much faster than I could type, google, and read an answer  There have been very few questions that she didn't have an answer for.    She's also very good with commands. It's not like a command line where a certain command HAS to be used. She understands synonyms as well as I can figure. Alexa - resume Spotify. Alexa - Continue spotify both result in the same action.  Alexa - Play Christmas music.  Alexa - Find Christmas music.  Both result in &#34;Holiday favorites&#34; being played from Amazon prime music.  The speaker isn't much better than a typical smart phone speaker but it's fine for playing music in the kitchen while you're cooking.  Easily connect external speakers via the 3.5mm connection or Bluetooth for &#34;big&#34; sound.    I bought another one after 2 days with the first one and I haven't begun to scratch the surface of what they're capable of.  At 40 bucks (cyber Monday) the first one was a steal. Compared to 129 for Google home.    Cons  Amazon is sooo crafty at finding ways of making us spend money without actually making it feel like we're spending money. Dash buttons. Having a conversation with Alexa. one click ordering. Be wary of the commercial giant. They're not your friend, but they do make some cool stuff! ",
"Marc E Kilgore","December 29, 2016 ",3.0,"Easy to connect to our WIFI, and I now have several in my house + a couple Echo units. I have had no connectivity or reliability issues. I've got our  Honeywell thermostat connected to it, which is totally cool. There's something satisfying about just being able to say, &#34;alexa, turn the thermostat up 2 degrees&#34;. Using the IFTTT software on their website, I've got some other things connected to it which is really fun. I've even created some Alexa skills from the Alexa developer kit to see how they are done. Yes, I've become somewhat obsessed and am waiting for the skill that I developed for our company to be certified by Amazon.  Some other cool things... I bought a bluetooth receive off of Amazon and connected it to our family room entertainment system,  big amp, and Klipsch speakers. I now have an Echo Dot using that bluetooth receiver to crank up the music. With the unlimited music subscription from Amazon, friends have a blast coming over the house and shouting music requests to Alexa. For $50, if you are interested in computers, home automation, or just love streaming music, you gotta get one.    A couple of drawbacks that are not huge...  1. I'd love to be able to tell one Echo to do something on a different Echo. Certainly it should be possible since the units are secured to an individual account, so I would expect that is coming soon.  2. I wish it could receive input from another service and tell me things. I'm sure that spam would be a problem that would have to be figured out.  3. There needs to be more ability to store information in your &#34;Alexa profile&#34; on alexa.amazon.com  and be able to use that information in skills.  4. Currently you cannot play music or MP3's as an alarm - seems like a pretty big missing feature.  5. There needs to be more integration with cell phones, services, etc so that Alexa can trigger a phone call to be made on your cell phone, etc. ",
"Joseph C. Antone","December 5, 2016 ",5.0,"Well, not quite as proficient as you see on commericals, but does a really great job.  It has a ton of apps (skills), and works pretty well from anywhere in our greatroom.  We keep it in the corner of our kitchen and can use it from the fireplace or television.    Not sure about the &#34;connect to speaker&#34; I keep seeing.  While we DO have ours connected to an old pair of BOSE companion 2 speakers, it can be operated with its own speaker.  Its not a great speaker, but it will work, play music, recite your shopping lists and reaches a reasonable volume.    We have a second one we plan to put upstairs, but haven't done so yet.  I've read that many of the early issues with multiple Dots have been resolved.  I'll amend this if needed. ",
"michael onuoha","January 29, 2017 ",5.0,"Now 1st off I will say off the bat that you must understand that this whole internet of things technology is still in its infancy. Hence there is still much more growth for items like Echo to make.  Personally I bought the Echo because I wanted a cheaper solution than control 4 to automate my apartment.  Now if you are looking for a device to ask every question you can think of, then maybe you want to go with the Google home because Amazon is no where close to matching Google in its search & analytical capabilities.  However, if you want a device that can connect to your Spotify, turn on your connected devices, handle simple tasks like read the news, jokes, weather.... Then the Echo is a winner.  Pros:  1) Easy setup. Plug it in, download the app, connect to your wifi, sign in to your account & you are done.  2) Small but fully functional. Not the best speakers but it still does everything else is bigger brother Alexa can do. However it comes with an auxiliary Jack & hence you can hook it up to a better speaker like your Bose sound dock.  3) My wife loves it. We keep it on the kitchen counter & she plays music while she cooks. Also keeps my kids entertained.  4) Increasing library of new skills & connectable products being added that are compatible with Alexa. Even car companies like Volkswagen are confusing using Alexa in their vehicles.  5) Quite good at noise cancelling & recognizing voice commands even in a noisy room especially compared to Google.    CONS:  1) As I mentioned, Alexa isn't the smartest. For most of your questions, you are most likely gonna get back a &#34;I don't have the answer for that&#34;.  2) The speakers aren't the greatest. But then again it costs only $49.    I've only had the Echo for a month now. I'll update my review of need be in the future. But for the price, she's worth every penny. Great job Amazon. ",
"Randolph L. Todd","December 12, 2016 ",5.0,"I have the four different Alexa products and love them! But if I was buying today, I would buy these and put one in each bedroom, kitchen, bathrooms, etc. I have that now but with the different devices because I bought them as soon as they were available. But these are affordable and awesome Echo Dots and I recommend them highly. I wish they came with a year of Amazon Prime included for about $15 extra and they would be the best gifts ever for about $65.00. Highly Recommended. ",
Brandon,"January 12, 2017 ",4.0,"At first I was skeptical about the whole line of Alexa products, but I ended up buying the echo dot for my girlfriend for Christmas and we both LOVE it.    First off, the setup is very easy. I even paired it to a smart light within 10 minutes and was able to control it by voice no problem.    One of my favorite features of the echo dot is being able to tell your echo to play you music and she will play music that relate to your amazon music likings. It awesome to be able to just say play me a song and have it playing in 2 seconds vs having to fidget with connecting your phone to your Bluetooth speaker and then having to select the music.    The echo dot also has a bunch of very useful features, some of which include:    ~Setting an Alarm  ~Settin a timer  ~Telling Jokes  ~Smart House  ~Asking for the weather    There's a ton more awesome things your echo dot can do but those seem to be the most used for me.    The sound is adjustable and can be set very loud so that's not a worry.    My only wish for the next model is to add a battery so that you can move your echo dot around if you want too, also if the power goes it, sometimes the echo dot doesn't reconnect to the wifi automatically.    Every time I say &#34;Echo&#34; it responds unless there's a lot of background noise happening. In that case I have to raise my voice a little bit. I found the commnd &#34;echo&#34;, worked better than &#34;amazon&#34; or &#34;Alexa&#34;.    Lastly, it looks GREAT. Amazon did an amazing job with the design and looks wonderful on my nightstand, especially when the blue ring lights up.    This product is awesome and the sky is the limit for you. Whether you're creating a smart house, or you just want to hear a couple jokes here and there, the amazon echo dot is a great product and I would recommend it! ",
gd,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"There is a definite novelty factor to the Echo Dot and what  questions Alexa can answer. And it does offer a few convenience features. But it won't be long until you realize the Echo Dot and Alexa have a few shortcomings that prevent Alexa from transcending from a novelty item to a real productive virtual assistant. First, Alexa is all pull and no push. By that I mean the Dot is able to reach out and talk to other devices and cloud services when you initiate that conversation, but devices and cloud services cannot initiate the conversation themselves without Alexa reaching out first. This lack of support for push communications is very limiting. For example, take Alexa's &#34;reminder&#34;. Say you would like to be reminded to take recycling out Tuesday mornings before leaving for work. All Alexa can do is add a &#34;to-do&#34; note in the Alexa app, and on Tuesday morning you will miss recycling again because the Dot won't notify you unless you ask Alexa what is in your to-do list that morning. That's just one simple use case that could easily be remedied by supporting push communications.    Another shortcoming is Amazon's lack of a cloud productivity suite of its own thlo easily integrate with Alexa and support new skills.    Finally, not a design flaw but still worth noting, Alexa does not offer voice based authentication. That is something important to keep in mind if you plan on having people over, as anyone can snoop through your to-do lists, shopping lists and calendars without your permission. I don't think anyone offers this level of security right now, so it's no surprise. But it would be nice to see Amazon break ground in this front first.    Overall, this is a very cool product at a good price point. But the technology and the Alexa Skill Kit SDK is still very limited, so keep expectations low and you won't be disappointed. ",
"Mic S.","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I do like my Dot and it does make some things more convenient. However some things that you would think would be very simple she simply cannot do. For example, I started playing music at 100% volume, when I needed it a little quieter I said &#34;Alexa, set the volume to 50%&#34; and she had no clue what I meant. I had to go and search how to change the volume by voice and in order to change the volume you have to say &#34;Alexa, set the volume to (a number between 1-10).&#34; That's the only thing she understands for volume control. I have only had the Dot for one day so I have not run into a whole lot of other bugs yet. I am currently in the process of getting smart switches for my lights and a new thermostat for all the smart home automation and I will update my review once I get all of that.    EDIT on 12-10-2016: I now have 7 of these setup in my house and my review is now going down to 3 stars (started at 4). The reason for this is again, simple things that you would think would be easy, Alexa cannot do. Another example, I have all my Dots named in the app (Kitchen, Livingroom, Loft, etc.) When I start playing music on my kitchen dot you think it would be easy to say &#34;Alexa, transfer the music to the loft&#34; but of course Alexa has no idea what you are even talking about. I have tried phrasing it differently and I came to the realization that no matter how you say it it's not going to happen. So if I like a song that is on I have to wait until that song is over because if I go into a new room I have to start the music over even if I choose the same station (through prime music). I have also tried playing music by saying &#34;Alexa, play pop music on all dots&#34; and again, no idea what I am saying so I tried phrasing it &#34;Alexa, play pop music in the entire house&#34; but she doesn't understand that either. I also took my review down to 3 stars because they say that if you have more than one echo dot within ear shot they automatically know which one you are closest to and only that one responds, this is true 95% of the time. However, I have on more than one occasion asked my kitchen echo dot a question and then heard the dot in the living room giving me a different answer at the same time as the one that I am closest to. For the most part I like my dots, but they really need to do some updating I think. ",
Paul,"December 29, 2016 ",4.0,"Amazon gave people a reason to try out home AI this year when they released this product, a standalone/tiny version of the larger Echo.  I have used the Echo Dot for about 1 week and have found it to be a pleasant, albeit flawed, device.    The only difference between the two models from what I can tell is size and sound quality.  This is to ignore the second, mid-sized &#34;Echo Tap&#34; which only has value as a portable speaker and is not suited for use within the home.  The way this product, the Dot, was advertised led me to believe it needed to be plugged into an external speaker in order to work however it does in fact have a built-in speaker and can be used by itself.  The speaker is neither loud nor dynamic but it puts sound in the room when you need it to.    The biggest flaw for me is with Amazon's dirty policy of refusing to allow competing services to work on it's devices.  I pay for streaming music through Google Play; however I cannot use the Echo to access this music because Amazon wants me to purchase music from them instead.  At the same time, Amazon has the Prime Video service I pay for;  they do not allow my google devices, such as my Chromecast-enabled television, to access Prime video because Amazon wants me to buy a stupid Fire stick instead.  The real craziness here is that Amazon runs it's entire Fire ecosystem on Android because Google gives it away for free (so there really is no excuse).    In the end, I want to recommend this device because it's cheap, it's well-designed, and it's the first step in the new wave of home tech.  But at the same time, Amazon's policy of exclusion really hurts consumers and hinders their own success.  If you are a person who uses &#34;competing services&#34; such as Netflix, Tidal, Apple Music or Google Play, you probably want to wait for a more universally compatible home AI. ",
Karen,"November 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I love Echo Dot 2nd generation.  I bought 3 for Christmas gifts and a few months later decided I needed one, too.  I am NOT techie savvy and I'm usually  quite confused with technical set-up instructions but this was easy and fast.  I even linked it to my TV sound bar and listen to music through that.  Every morning I like Alexa to start me off with a joke, the weather forecast for the day and some gentle music..  It's just a fun and handy little thing and I highly recommend it. ",
travelgirl,"January 3, 2017 ",3.0,"So I've debated back and forth between the dot and the echo....obviously I ultimately chose the dot (2nd generation). I'm glad I did. I wanted to try the whole concept out and the dot is letting me do just that.  The dot is obviously significantly smaller than the echo, costs less, but I think (as far as my research goes) they work identically ...more or less (if you're talking specs...size/cost/a FEW features ie speaker size, etc). From what I can tell: everything else is the same. I've added a few &#34;skills&#34; to my dot, from the Alexa app (examining the scriptures daily JW...which I LOVE!!! Bible Glossary JW, Chef (substitution ideas), ESPN flash briefing...which isn't so &#34;flash&#34; more long-winded...like all other &#34;flash briefings&#34;, trivia game, and a few others. I did find that some, although show to be &#34;enabled skills,&#34; aren't currently working...endless back/forth with Alexa as to whether they're actually enabled or not...she seems conflicted...so as I said some aren't working.  She does awaken pretty easily usually, except maybe if/when I speak fast. I do love to use it when in the kitchen. &#34;Alexa, set a timer for 25 mins. Alexa what's the weather, Alexa play some Michael Buble, Alexa, how much time is left on my timer.? Alexa how many ounces in 3 1/2 cups? You'd be surprised with the things that could happen in just a short 25 mins of cooking....where your hands are literally FULL of food  (ie. breaded chicken gooey stuff!)  I'm looking forward to more skills becoming available (ie. when you ask her to look up a recipe to a food item, and she can actually read it out to you. For now, she doesn't seem to be able to do this....I think maybe because she's not able to &#34;choose&#34; the one YOU&#34;D choose???  I'm also looking forward to the &#34;skills enabled&#34; kinks to get worked out!!! ",
Jaye,"April 23, 2017 ",5.0,"I'm not a big tech junkie, but every now and again, certain tech items just seem &#34;right&#34; for me.  That was the case when I first heard of the Echo.  I researched extensively before deciding to purchase the Dot instead of the full size.  The only difference so far as I can tell is that the full size has a higher quality speaker, and since I'm not one to be overly concerned about sound quality, and don't like loud music, I decided to try this one.    As for the speaker quality, it is far better than I expected.  All of the descriptions, articles, and reviews I read indicated that everyone with a Dot would have to connect it to a separate speaker.  If you like loud music, or are extremely concerned with a high sound quality, I suppose that's true.  But, after receiving my Dot yesterday, I don't necessarily agree.    I expected to get about the same amount of sound out of this little gadget as I do from my Fire tablet.  Whoa!  It is so much more than that!  Now again, I know folks who like their music loud, and for that segment of the population, you'll want the external speaker.  I prefer music to be either mid-grade or soft background sound, and this more than does the trick.  I currently have it in a 180 sq ft room, and I personally cannot handle having it turned up to 10 (loudest setting) while in the same room.  My home is around 1300 sq ft, and with the Echo Dot on one end of the house, I can hear it at 10, though faintly, from the opposite end.  It's a long ranch house, so you get the idea I hope.    Another positive is that setup was amazingly simple.  I'd received my Wemo plugs the day before, and they were a nightmare to set up - barely any instructions, and tech support was very difficult to reach.  But that's a separate review.  In any case, I was terrified I'd be spending several more hours trying to get this little thing set up, but quite the opposite.  Within about 5 minutes of removing it from the package, it was set up and linked to my Wemo switches!  Super easy, and not only simple but good instructions.    Now on to the cons I've found so far.  First, despite what Amazon says, when the music is turned up, the microphones sometimes do not hear you speaking to it unless you shout.  That seems to be intermittent, though.    I've added several &#34;skills&#34;, and many of them have bugs or just don't work at all.  The one that I would find very enjoyable except that it doesn't work well is the Word Master game.  Alexa does not understand many of the words I say, and despite repeating them over and over again, I often have to just pick a different word.  I had the same issue with the Quick Event skill to add items to my calendar.  For some reason, she would not understand the word &#34;Thursday&#34; - although outside of this skill has no trouble with that word in general.    I would also like to see a software update where you can spell a word if she does not understand, and then you can ensure it's accurate - especially when trying to add something to your calendar.    My other complaint is that while Echo Dot is playing music, my Fire tablet which is linked to this device keeps its screen lit up.  I usually only have to charge my Fire once or twice per week, and yesterday went through around 80% of a full charge.  You can turn the display off on the tablet manually, but then as soon as you speak to Alexa again, it lights back up and you'd have to keep turning it off manually - which sort of defeats the purpose of having an Echo you can talk to!  I'd really love to see Amazon fix that, because I don't like the idea of draining the battery so fast all of the time and wearing it out faster than necessary.    After using it for a little while yesterday, I decided to go ahead and purchase a Sensi smart thermostat to use with it.  I will be buying other Smart Home gadgets to connect with this a little at a time.  And, I may decide to purchase a second Dot for use in my studio at the other end of my home.  All in all, I'm quite happy with this new little toy, aside from the few things I've mentioned.  I will add updates as any other issues or benefits arise! ",
Linda,"January 12, 2017 ",4.0,"Still has a few quirks and doesn't always understand requests the first time, but this is quickly becoming a welcomed addition to my home and quickly making Alexa indispensable! (Example of easy to use skills: turning the TV on or off, increasing or decreasing TV or Stereo volume, Setting a morning alarm, or setting a  timer ( great when you're cooking and your hands are sticky!), Turing lights on or off, or inquiring about the temperature or weather forecast. One of my favorites is &#34;Alexa, what my news briefing for today: You chose which news sources you want to hear. This is great while getting ready for work in the morning.  I did knock off a star because there is ONE MAJOR inconvenience for those people who have family sharing: For example, my daughter and son-in-law and I have family sharing for our Kindle Libraries and Alexa CAN NOT separate my shopping list or do do list from theirs. You can ask &#34;Alexa which profile are you in?&#34; and she will tell me she is is mine (not my daughter's Amazon account&#34;, but every command I give alexa, and every command they give alex is merged into the SAME HISTORY, even though we have SEPARATE  Amazon accounts. My news briefing and skills are separated from theirs, but &#34;To do lists&#34; and Shopping Lists are merged.  At this time, my daughter and I have agreed that SHE will use Alexa for lists, and I will use my iPhone Siri for shopping and &#34;to do&#34; lists.  In addition,  there isn't any privacy with your Alexa use if you have family sharing. It seems to allow you to change your profile to anyone on your family sharing and control their Alexa as well... Interesting, I could say &#34;Alexa, change profile to &#34;Daughter&#34; account. Then I could say, Alexa, turn on TV, and she would. A big negative if you don't have a lot of trust with who you've shared your Kindle Library with. ",
"Devyn Hart","November 21, 2016 ",4.0,"What a great idea, and excellent execution! The idea that I can make a shopping list, or set an alarm, without interrupting my thought process to find some paper, or pull out my phone, is great! I'm jumping on to the wagon a little late, but the Echo Dot is very easy to use, and has tutorials and instructions to help you learn how to use Alexa's voice recognition properly. You can set dates or reminders in your calendar, and with the many skills currently out, and the ability to make your own (if you have the time and so desire) there really are infinite possibilities as to what Alexa can help you do; want to know how long your chicken has been in the freezer? There is a skill for that. Can't decide which workout you want to do today? There is a skill for that. Is the surf good this morning? Alexa can tell you. Forgot to shut off the lights down stairs? Alexa will do it for you (&#34;The Clapper&#34; on steroids). I saw a really great story about a man completely bed ridden and unable to move. He was given the Dot as a gift and now has &#34;someone&#34; to talk with and play games. The doctor's even noticed an improvement in his overall health and mood since having received the gift. The Echo Dot has amazing potential.    Really the only draw back I have found is that unlike its larger, more expensive counter-part, the Dot must always be plugged in to use. There has been a battery attachment developed that gives you about 6-8 hours of life (depending on usage), but if you find a good home for her to live it shouldn't be a problem for most. Also, if you will probably need one per room depending on floor layout and acoustic variables.open layouts may be able to utilize one for multiple rooms. Considering the price for one, though, even 2 or 3 wont break the bank, especially compared with all the other devices we use now. ",
PM,"February 18, 2017 ",4.0,"Absolutely love Alexa and this echo dot is the perfect way to help your friends and family to get started. I'm amazed at all it can do and it's ability is just getting started. I added Hue lights a week ago and already cannot imagine life without it. I always struggled to turn on/off my bedside light because the switch was way up inside the shade. Not an issue at all now. I gave three of them to three different households for Christmas. Only one was leary of it but they were on board once I set it up and started showing its ability. I'm looking forward to my house getting more voice controlled. Be aware, if it's in range of your TV and the Amazon Alexa commercial comes on, it will react!!!  I think my dad is really entertained by that part!! ",
Chromosome,"January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"In Sep 2106 I bought a second generation Echo to set up at work. I was never able to get it to work for longer than a couple of days. I think it has trouble connecting to WIFI networks that have a web page verification. We are talking about a university network that works well for everything else. It connected, but it would fall of the network. Finally, I gave up and I took it home in Marcy 2017, thinking that I would set up it there. Took a while. I was pretty disappointment until I realized that the Alexa server was down. While I was figuring this out, I looked into the warranty.  Have you tried to visit the Amazon warranty page? You should: https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201014520.

Well, one may say. It must be a mistake. Sure, but how to fix it? It took a long time (ok, maybe I am thick, but it was not obvious) to find phone support. End of the story, it is now working.

"Eduardo Neecha","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"First off, the Alexa app failed to work properly on my Android tablet (Google Nexus 7), gave up after 3 attempts of installing and uninstalling and reinstalling.  Amazon's &#34;spinning circle of death&#34; (just like Apple's &#34;spinning wheel of death&#34;) basically would never stop spinning and totally froze up the app every time!  This was a bad omen for things to come.    Finally had to use my laptop to set up this device, and even that took a bit of aggravation and delays.  Not nearly as smooth and simple as claimed.    Once finally set up, the Echo kept getting disconnected from my wifi even though my other wireless devices (laptop, tablet) were fine,so I knew it wasn't my router or wifi carrier's fault.    Generally speaking, whenever it did work, I found this device to be exhausting and annoying to use with all the delays.  The lag between saying &#34;Alexa&#34; to making the command to waiting for the command to be executed, was just way the heck too long.  The only things that seemed somewhat snappy were simply queries like &#34;What time is it?&#34; or &#34;How's the weather for tomorrow?&#34;  It also seems to understand a dismally small range of commands, even compared to the voice-driven Google app on my tablet.    I bought this device mainly because I use Amazon Music a lot, with my Prime membership.  The Amazon stream includes about 10-20% horrible songs that I have to skip over such as playing (gag!) &#34;smooth jazz&#34; garbage in the middle of &#34;traditional jazz&#34; stations.  (It was more like 40% crappy tracks in the beginning, until several weeks of my &#34;thumbs down and skip&#34; commands on various tracks improved things a bit.)  I bought the Echo Dot hoping that I could down-vote/eliminate the crappy content and &#34;add to library&#34; the good stuff, without needing to run back and forth to my computer all the time, since I run my computer's audio output to my music receiver and speakers.    (Wish they'd make some kind of RF remote control for the Amazon Music player, I'd happily pay for that!)    Also, I don't think the Echo dot has much onboard memory, judging from how often it would pause and stutter while streaming music---suggests that there is really not much buffering going on.  Simply outrageous considering how cheap memory has been for the last couple years.  Streaming was much smoother and reliable on my computer.    Just not ready for prime time yet.  I guess they are having consumers beta-testing it, just like Microsoft does with every new version of Windows. ",

Also, thanks to finding the right dock connector, it gave new life to our older Bose SoundLink 32 pin connector version. ",
"Deni S.","March 14, 2017 ",5.0,"Bought for my boyfriend for this birthday. He loves it to check the weather, listen to the news and stream his Spotify music. It is certainly helpful for searching for information if your hands aren't available for your phone or computer. It has a wide range of audio and listening, I often ask the echo questions from another room and it can pick up my voice.  Definitely a cool gadget! ",
"Z Song","April 25, 2017 ",5.0,"Well, after couple of days, the novelty wears off. I like that she can play music, set alarms or read news etc, but that is about it how I use it for. More skills would be helpful but more importantly, a natural way of communicating, conversational is what I'd like her to have. Not in a Q, A, Q, A format, kind of feeling like using MS DOS in the 80s. ",
TeresaS,"April 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I'm older and not overly techi but it is nice to have this for little things. I can see the technology growing and it become very handy. It's a fun gadget for getting info. I like playing music with it, but the speaker isn't the best. I'd invest in the Echo if you really want to listen to music. That is my one star removal.    I'm glad we have one. ",
"Fel J. Cruz","April 11, 2017 ",3.0,"I love this thing. The only thing it lacks is portability. You can buy the Fremo battery base which is great if you use your Echo Dot away from its power source for about 6 hours, but I wanted more than that. Searching  through Amazon, I found everything I needed to build a way to run my Echo for more than 16 hours nonstop from a P108 Ryobi battery. You'll need the P111 battery charger and gut everything except the battery contacts so you can run power to a Drok DC-DC converter, and a short micro USB cable. It's ugly, but also kinda cool. ",
"Andy Mikloiche","March 31, 2017 ",4.0,"Bought this for my wife to use primarily as an alarm clock she has a hard time setting her digital 2 alarm settings bedside clock. The Echo Dot is the easiest way possible for her to get a wake  up call. She lets Alkexa know what time she would like to wake up and Alexa delivers every time, on time. ",
Courtney,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Just bought for Christmas. One for the main room and one for our bedroom. We are still getting use to getting everything to work on it, but so far it is still cool even as just a voice controlled radio. The one in the main room we use for music, timers, weather, and the one in the bedroom we use for waking us up, playing rain music while we sleep etc. Can't wait to use Uber on it and link it to our smart switches and smart thermostat. Can't beat the price for this hub. Prefer the echo dot over the larger one since most people would prefer listening to music through their sound system anyways.    I like how you can turn the volume down and up, but I wish they made it easier than saying &#34;ALEXA LOUDER&#34; and &#34;ALEXA QUIETER&#34; it usually takes me a few &#34;ALEXAS&#34; to get the volume the way I want it. Maybe there is an easier way I just haven't found out yet.  Also wish ALEXA had the capability to turn off an on my bluetooth speaker. Seems like our speaker has to always be on in order for ALEXA to use it. If there is a way to turn it off and on with voice control someone please let me know.    I am sure that ALEXA will only get more awesome as updates occur, but it still deserved 5 stars even with the little kinks it has. Really hope Amazon makes a cheaper alternative than the harmony hub to be able to voice activate the TV. Fire stick you can only use the remote voice activation. I want to be able to turn on my TV and change my direct TV channels using ALEXA, but hopefully this will happen soon.    This is a review after only playing around with it for a day or two. I will try and post a more comprehensive one once we install all of our smart home features and use it for a month or so. ",
"Jessica S Baker","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"got this for christmas. its not great if you dont have any home automation you can use with it. otherwise, your phone wiht google now can tell you the weather and whats on your calendar.  i LOVE it because i have all my lights automated on my Wink app and it works. &#34;Alexa turn on my kitchen lights&#34; and bam.. it happens! now i dont hvae to get to my phone and press my shortcuts. i can be coming in the house wiht all hte groceries and &#34;alexa turn on morning mode&#34; and my path to the kitchen i all lit up! i also have &#34;move mode&#34; that i set up in the Wink app wiht my GE Link bulbs and they dim in the living room while shutting off all my other lights. AWESOME.  the only sad thing is that due to security issues they will not let alexa communicate to the garage door opener or the door locks that are automated. i have an &#34;away mode&#34; that turns off my lights and opens the garage door when i am leaving - but alexa cannot do this since it has the garage door attached.  also, it has a headphone jack on the back so i set this in the living room next to the surround sound and plugged it in the aux port and we leave the speaker on all the time. now we say &#34;play spotify&#34; and it will play on the surround sound. she also works wiht bluetooth speakers but we dont have a wall powered bluetooth yet.  its also nice that it works wiht my shared grocery list OurGrocereis app so we can add items easily when we are making dinner etc.  i dont see why people need a ton in their house.with my open floorplan and 1700 sf, we only need one. we yell down the hallway when going to bed &#34;alexa, all off!&#34; and all the lights go out haha. well maybe we mgiht want one in the master bedroom....:-) ",
"Andrew V","December 27, 2016 ",5.0,"Awesome gadget. The Dot is one of those things that you wouldn't ever NEED, but once you have it you question how you ever got by without it.    The Good:  1. Great for DJing, entertaining, or for your audiobooks...provided you pay extra for the various services needed to make those functions work well.  2. Myriad of organizational features are super handy, especially since I work from home. To do list and calendar sync are useful, I am much less likely to forget to set an appointment when I can just shout at Alexa to make it for me. Weather, currency/distance/time zone converting saves me a lot of random googling.  3. Surprisingly good at picking up commands from long distances despite background noise. Can hear and acknowledge commands even when I yell from in the shower.  4. Easy integration with new devices, I didn't have any trouble setting several bluetooth speakers up as well as a LIFX bulb. Setting up the LIFX bulb was a pain, but Alexa found it immediately.  5. The Dot is one of those devices that makes you think &#34;the future is now.&#34;    The Bad:  1. To really get your money's worth out of it, you pretty much need a music service or audible subscription.  2. You have to be very precise with your commands, Alexa isn't that great at decoding some requests. In the end, it's not a big deal, Alexa kind of &#34;trains&#34; you.  3. No built in battery  4. The Dot is so useful that I now angrily lament that more devices aren't voice activated.    The Ugly:  1. It's small and innocuous, no major complaints about the design or look.  2. The volume ring is not really persistently useful as it only appears when you're adjusting the volume. Pretty much means you have to remember where you left the volume.  3. I can't change the wake word to &#34;Computer&#34; to fully realize my dream of being on the Star Trek Enterprise ",
AHJ42,"January 12, 2017 ",5.0,"Great fun but effective.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the last fortnight, first with one, then two, and now four echo dots.  The first communicates with my sonos connect, and allows me, via the sonos app to ask for playlists and music in any zone. It will be nice when sonos and Amazon get their act together and allow me to ask for music in any zone without using the app, or delving into what is now years old programming in order to ask sonos to play any playlist, album or song.  Alexa talks to my hive system, and not only boosts my heating, but allows me to control and dim lights in several zones, and even switch off one of the two lights in my bedroom on the same switch, which shines in my eyes when I am reading in bed.  I am now putting a Logitech hub in place to control various electrical outlets.  The second dot is connected to a pair of speakers in my bedroom, but still allows me to control heat and lights.  The third echo is connected to my portable foxl speakers, and allows me to stream music in any internet accessible location, including friends and family's houses, and hotels. I can't wait to show this portable system off to my friends at our next reunion. Is there a link to allow friends purchases to allow discounts on my digital purchases?  The last dot is attached to the sound system at my girlfriend's place, which not only allows me to listen to my prime music at her place, but also can change the crappy music she plays to something sensible even When I am miles away😇  I have yet to explain to her how to turn my heating or lighting in at my home, but I can do this from a distance, to annoy or distract unwanted visitors 😂    In summary, a bit clunky, but full of potential ",
DrunkTown,"December 13, 2016 ",5.0,"Black Friday came and went. Like me, you may have decided to hold off on the retail kayos opting to spend your day browsing Amazon instead of suffering through the large crowds. One of the gadgets that caught my eye was the Amazon Echo dot. It is basically a scaled down version of the larger wireless Amazon Echo. It was on sale for only $40, so I decided to give it a try. By Monday morning it had arrived.    First things first, one of my favorite movies growing up was Smart House. I'm a huge fan of Home Automation and the smart home life. I had seen the Echo before, but not being a huge fan of Siri I figured it was just more of the same. That being said this thing is pretty darn cool.    Getting Started:    The Echo dot is extremely easy to setup. You download the Alexa app (Alexa is the echo dot interface, like Siri) pair it with your WiFi and you are up and running. It took about 5 minutes. The dot wakes when you say Alexa. You can then ask it basic questions about the weather, or give commands like &#34;turn on the lights&#34; if you have existing smart technologies. Through the back-end you can make Alexa smarter by enabling specific skills.    Favorite Things    Games: My wife and I love playing Jeopardy. The dot has a built in game that asks six questions updated daily. They are related to actual game categories that aired that day, but entirely different questions.    Smart Accessories: If you purchase a smart switch, you can enable the dot to turn on and off your lights with a simple command. Since it is daylight savings time this is pretty awesome.    Audio Playback: Audible books, music library, podcasts, ect are a simple command away from playback. Really useful.    Making the home smarter is the trend this holiday season and it is only going to become more advanced in the near future. The echo dot is an entry level piece of technology that is a more convenient, and frankly a more useful version of Apple's Siri. Alexa doesn't know the answers to everything. It can be frustrating repeating yourself and rephrasing specific questions to try and get an answer. Nevertheless, when paired with a smart thermostat like Nest it can really make your home life more pleasant. After only a week, I bought four more! ",
"Richard Stone","January 20, 2017 ",5.0,"I love this little hockey puck speaker. Personally, I think they should have called it the Amazon Echo Puck. I suppose that might have been too Shakespearian. Anyway, it does everything it promises to do, and much more than I expected.    It has no problem understanding me at all, which is more than I can say for telemarketers whom I instruct to never, never, ever call me again. I can call out its name from anywhere in my 5 room home, and it responds immediately. It even hears me when I'm in my bedroom with the speaker speaking loudly away next to my ear.    It does so much. Some say another he-who-shall-not-be-named brand does more. I beg to differ with you, Some! Add in some skills and ITTT scripts, and it does everything I want and more. For instance, I use &#34;My Grocery&#34; with the corresponding skill, and it works great keeping me supplied with supplies for the above mentioned meager meals.    To Echo or to Puck, I mean, Dot? The Echo has a good speaker built in, but the Dot, combined with a speaker, such as the one I purchased from Papa Amazon,&nbsp;Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 Next Generation Ultra Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker : Louder Volume 10W+, More Bass, Water Resistant, Perfect Speaker for Golf, Beach, Shower & Home (Black), is cheaper than buying the Echo and will provide good sound and portability. The Puck, aka Dot, is also less visibly intrusive having a much small footprint.    The, uh, ok, Dot, will do so much more, including Hal-like control of most everything in my home, though I am not yet using it this way. It would be worth the price for me solely for controlling music and my shopping and ToDo lists. Thanks, Amazon, you done good! ",
Pumpkin,"December 7, 2016 ",5.0,"I love the concept even though she's hard hearing at times. She can't answer a lot of questions but she functions as a calculator, dictionary, timer, alarm clock, music streamer, and her skills are like apps on your phone and she has a few good ones. Overall, worth the price. Thanks Amazon, cool deal!    Surprisingly, her speaker is nice and smooth sounding, although there is practically no bass at all. There is clear midrange and highs are present so the music is enjoyable through her. The speaker is on the bottom, interestingly done, but if you sit her on the bed you can't hear her well. =) ",
gardener97,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"OMG - I want one in every room. You can think of any song you ever heard, ask Echo (or Alexa, you decide on the name) to play it and there it is - a real trip down memory lane or up to date new. This little Dot speaker is OK. No it is not the Bose Mini, but it is OK. (I actually have the Bose Mini in the bedroom) and if you have a second Dot in the kitchen you can just let the Dot speaker play and it is not bad. I LOVE being able to say &#34;Echo put appliance bulbs on the shopping list&#34; and next time I'm at the grocery, there it is on my list. I don't have to think about going to write something down. Questions? Yeah, you say&#34; Echo how old is Ruth Bader Ginsburg?&#34; and Echo says &#34;83, she was born...&#34; and you can either listen to the rest or say &#34;Echo stop&#34;.    There is a to-do list too. &#34;Echo, put oil change on the to do list&#34;.  If you need to have more than 2 lists, you can get some 3rd party apps to build more lists.    Skills: skills are like apps gone crazy. Like Skill Meow actually meows and drives your cat nuts. Tons of skills.    You can build a huge library of playlists and music. You can upload your own music or if you are a prime member, there are about a jillion songs out there just waiting for you. You have to download the Alexa app and the Amazon music app. The music app is a bit squirrelly (to me) and I find building playlists on my computer works better than on the iPhone or the iPad. You need to be in the right place though - this url is gold! that would be music dot amazon dot com - and build away.    Echo/Dot will also read your audible books to you, picking up wherever you last left off and you can say 'echo, back up a minute' or whatever too.    Also you can just say “Echo, play some Mozart” and she will start right in. Or just say play classical, or smooth jazz or 60s rock. She will pull them off the huge amazon library. Once in a while she won’t have a song you want but I find if I say it again, or say it putting the artists name either in the front or the back of the request, she will find it. Also you can see your queue on the Alexa app so you can skip around.    And she can tell you jokes. Not terribly good jokes if you are over 9 but cute. ",
Jake,"March 6, 2017 ",5.0,"I love the Echo Dot - Alexa is pretty intuitive, and she gets better as you &#34;learn each other&#34; - the skills that you can add make it even more useful - I was hesitant to buy this because I figured it was a luxury I didn't really need, but I used someone else's and it was just too good to pass up.    The Dot is just like the full fledge Echo, just cheaper - I got this and a cool pair of water speakers for $15 bucks and it works the same. (so $65 total vs. $180) - it's great to have her play whatever radio station you want, particular songs - whatever. (Plus Chuck Norris stuff).    Buy it, you won't be sad. Like I said, get a pair of decent speakers with it and you won't be losing anything with the Dot vs. the Echo. ",
Moni,"November 17, 2016 ",5.0,"Great little know it all. Funny thing is, my mom has an European accent and at times the machine cannot understand her question and only answers &#34;I can not find an answer for your inquiry&#34; but when I ask the exact same question Alexa answers me.

"Fringe Dweller","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I own more of these than I care to admit, given the size of the house I live in. I also have one at work. Wish I had met Alexa before I met my ex-wife. The Dot and the full sized Echo are excellent products. ",

"Patty barlow","March 20, 2017 ",5.0,"Love, love love the Amazon Echo dot.  I bought this as a warehouse deal and it looked brand new at a fraction of the brand new price.  Works like a charm and I have it cabled to my Bose sound dock so the music I play sounds great.  The internal speaker works o.k. If you didn't use another external speaker but I am not sure I would have been 100% happy with the sound. ",
"Kevin Bailey","April 25, 2017 ",4.0,"Bought two of these.  One works great.  The second one doesn't work at all now.  After It stopped 3 or 4 days ago I finally called customer support.  All they wanted to do was have me unplug it, plug it back in, then go through the Alexa app and try setting it up again.  I told them I had tried that several times already, but it kept coming up with an error.  Gave them the error code.  On several discussion sites it stated that the error was supposedly in the registration server and that other folks had success calling into support and having the registration manually pushed through.  No such luck with me.  Finally got to someone who was going to help me get it replaced.  BUT FIRST....  You guessed it....  I had to go through all the troubleshooting steps again.  For....what?....  Maybe the 1024th time?  Decided enough is enough and hung up.  So I guess I'm stuck with this ...  thing that doesn't work.    I'm usually a patient person.  But I really fell like I was just run through a gauntlet designed to wear me down and it achieved it's desired result of me dropping the whole thing.  So I have a device I got for Christmas that doesn't work.  I liked it when it worked.  I hate it now that it doesn't.  I am hoping someone from Amazon sees this and corrects the situation.  Because right now, Amazon has left a bad taste in my mouth and I just can't take anymore run-arounds from them. ",
"Tiffany Wright","April 14, 2017 ",5.0,"The only reason for 4 stars is that the volume on Alexa doesn't go loud enough. Fixable with a Bluetooth speaker but that's extra money if you don't own one.

The humor ones are hilarious! ",

Dan,"March 18, 2017 ",4.0,"When I opened it, the first thing I couldn't wait to do was ask it a question, so I asked Siri, and waited. I asked again and then again, my friend who was present, said check to see if it's plugged in, so I did. Finally I checked the connection to the internet. I asked the same thing, but still nothing, so I heard my friend dying laughing in the kitchen. He said, you idiot, it's not siri, its ALexa! I felt like a complete idiot, so I rephrased my question and asked, Alexa. She piped up immediately and answered everything I asked her. So do I love her, of course, she is awesome, I swear I feel like I am living on the SpaceShip on Star Trek. I would totally recommend this for anyone. My 8 year old loves her, he has so many questions that I have to refer to the internet for, now he can ask her those difficult questions and get an answer each time. Her speaker is actually very nice, I wont buy an external one, unless I find it cheap, I am satisfied with this one. I loved that it links my amazon music automatically. She is sensitive and can hear you speak from another room. SHe sets alarms, tells the weather and lets you know when you have an appointment. I want to connect everything to her, so she can run it all! I wouldn't trade her for anything, totally recommend it and it's cheap, 50.00 bucks!! Great gift for anyone who doesn't have one. ",

Lana,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"EDIT (4/26):  I wanted to provide more information as I interact with this device and compare the responses using Google (Assistant) on my android phone.  Recently, I asked Alexa how many pounds in 138 kilos,  she did NOT know it.  I then asked google and got a quick response. Today I asked Alexa, what is the planet after Uranus (it's Neptune btw) and at first she didn't understand me.  I asked it again very slowly, and she couldn't answer.  I asked Google Assistant and got an immediate response.  I find myself not really interacting with it except for very specific reasons and since I only spent 49 bucks for this device, I have been very forgiving of it.  If I had spent 179, this device would be a little better than a glorified weather, radio, and music delivery system.  Since amazon is pretty ubiquitous and the first to market this type of tech, it is doing well, but  lately I am finding it pretty underwhelming.    PREVIOUS review..  First let me say I absolutely love the idea of the Alexa products.  I purchased the Echo Dot with so much excitement and I couldn't wait to plug it in and start interacting with it.  I use it to set alarms, I use it to get the weather, play music, setup lists, and add calendar events.  The voice recognition is not perfect and I don't expect that.  I have used the voice training a couple of times and intend on doing it some more.    Here's the reason for the 3 stars -- the connectivity is bad it's been dropping a lot recently.  When I first got it, it was fine.  Now, I have had to re-establish WiFi 2-3 times per day.  I do it before I leave for work and I come home and I have to do it. again.  That means I also have to have it  re-connect to my smart devices (I have a Phillips Hue).  It is a pain and this is the only device I have this issue with.  I have a Mac, a gaming PC, and a cellphone and none of them have a problem with my WiFi and I steam live TV!    I suspect, though I can't be sure, that it might have something to do with going having to to through Amazon's WiFi and cloud network. Who knows and as a user, I DON'T care, I just want it to work and it doesn't work consistently!  I really don't want to use Google's assistant, but I'm seriously considering it.  I was going to purchase another Dot for the downstairs, but I am going to wait and see what happens.    If I had purchased the Alexa for 180 bucks, I'd really be annoyed.    UPDATE:  Things have been stable for a few days and I updated my rating.  I really do enjoy this device, it's not perfect, but I see many benefits in having one.  Ask Alexa &#34;What sounds do whales make&#34; ",

Jordan,"April 12, 2017 ",5.0,"This thing comes in handy for music everyday. Other most used skills are timer, clock, J6, weather, grocery list, and some random info.

"Carl B.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I'm a big fan of the echo product line. I own Echo Dot and the Alexa full size version. The only downside to the echo dot 2nd generation is the volume controls. The original Echo Dot had turning mechanism where you would physically move the outside Rim left a right to increase the volume. The second generation uses two buttons to increase or lower the volume. Unfortunately these buttons are not backlit so you can't see them in the dark or even low light. Overall the sound is much more improved with this second generation. ",
"Robyn P","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"After having the Dot for a few weeks, I have to say Alexa doesn't know much! I ask simple questions and I get &#34;Hmmm, I don't know how to answer that&#34;.  I put a series of questions to both Alexa and Ok Google and Google answered them all. Alexa couldn't answer any. I understand  you must enable skills, and I have, but for basic questions??? Google is the clear winner here.  That being said, I pay for the Unlimited  music for $3.99 and basically use the Dot as a personal  DJ. I tell her what to play and she does it. For $50, it's a neat gadget, but my next gadget will be Google Home. ",
"T. Anderson","April 1, 2017 ",4.0,"When I received the Dot as a gift I wondered what I would do with it because I already had the Echo. I placed the Dot in my bathroom thinking it would be good to hear the weather while I am dressing for the day. Well, now I not only ask for the morning temperature, I also ask for the morning headlines, the forecast, a bit of music and the traffic report while I'm getting ready for work. I've come to depend on it so much, I would hate to start my day without it. ",
IonMoon,"March 30, 2017 ",3.0,"I am enjoying the Dot and hope to grow to love it even more as the technology develops.    I currently do not have any appliances synced to it. I do have it plugged into my amp/speakers, so I can listen to music at a decent quality by just asking. This is a feature I really enjoy.    We have a small two-story house and Alexa can hear me from anywhere on the first floor, even whispering across the room. From the second floor, she can hear me if I go to the hall and shout down the stairs.    Some things it cannot yet do, that I am hoping for... the commute/traffic skill is nice, but it seems to only work for one location that I enter. I would like to enter multiple locations or even speak an address to ask about someplace I don't go regularly. Search functions are weak. Things like spelling, definitions, simple math, and common facts (temperatures, elevations, etc) it is GREAT with... but ask a more complicated question that Siri or Google can answer and you get nada. Shopping and to-do lists are great... but I have to go into the app to delete something. I wish I could &#34;train&#34; Alexa to give particular responses based on things I say.    Functions I love and use the most: okay, honestly, next to music listening, we have probably used the easter eggs the most... but functionally- traffic, weather, simple facts/info as stated above and reading wiki pages, shopping and to-do lists and calendar, and the timer.    Are these things I could do with my phone? Yes, but not without physically interacting with it. What the Echo has done is free me from my phone. ",
"Brad D.","March 20, 2017 ",5.0,"Love having Alexa. The Echo Dot was my first move towards a &#34;smart&#34; home and it has been very functional. I'm not the kind to use random features, but Alexa provides everything I need. I connected my spotify account so she can play music on command which I love. Other than that I use her features for an alarm clock, the weather, and to connect to my other smart devices. I purchased Phillips smart bulbs to pair with the echo dot, so I can turn on my lights on command which works well. I also purchased smart plugs as well for other items such as a fan, but I have yet to set those up.    Overall I am very pleased with the dot. The speaker isn't incredible, but when you just want to hear a song or a playlist real quick it is all you need. If you're real particular you can always connect to a blue tooth speaker, which is very easy to do. The wifi connection has been pretty good, I have an older house which can lead to spotty connections but I have had very few issues. The white color of the dot combined with the blue light looks very sleek and can be put wherever you want without looking out of place.    I did expect more &#34;skills&#34; to be available since it's been around long enough, but like I said I don't bother with the more obscure ones. I'd assume that more features are continually being added, but for now it's got everything I need. I did download the Uber and Domino's skills but have yet to use them.    Overall I am very happy that I bought the echo dot and look forward to connecting more devices and taking advantages of all the features Alexa has to offer. ",
"K. Biegler","January 13, 2017 ",5.0,"Well what can you say? Ok, One day I told Alexa that, 'I loved her' ... she answered back ... 'That's nice, Thank You' ... so I guess we're going to only be 'just friends' :-D    It's a pretty nice small device, if you are looking for audiophile fantastic ... no ... but for the nightstand and controlling Nest and hopefully lights as well as streaming music it's a pretty nice addition to the home. Looking forward to the new battery pack when it arrives and hopefully they are on schedule with teaching her to control my Sonos for now though streaming radio stations from around the country via the web or Pandora we are loving it ... getting weather, news briefs and setting alarms with simple voice commands is pretty nice. Alexa? even if you only want to be just friends, I still love you! ",
Ira,"February 23, 2017 ",5.0,"I honestly thought this was going to be a gimmick or a toy that I would only use now and then or to just show off, but oh man was I proven wrong this little thing can do so much and it does it almost instantaneously it is such an amazing little piece of hardware and software I use it for keeping track of NBA scores, asking about weather, playing my favorite music, setting timers and reminders, asking the date and time when I'm writing down things and forget the date, I rarely get amazed by tech anymore but this truly amazed me and I am very happy with my Echo Dot so much so that I got my parents and my sister to get a few of them after showing it off to them, it is truly amazing I recommend this to anyone especially skeptics like I was. ",
"S. Jones","November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"This is a great entry level echo. Personally I like the regular echo better for certain reasons, but other people may have the exact opposite thoughts so read on. Note I bought a portable battery for my regular echo so it is fully portable so keep that in mind while reading this. The battery cost about ~$50 so add that to the $179 of the regular echo.    Pros:  - The Dot is awesome at $49. A steal.  - You can use your own Bluetooth speaker. I have a Bose Mini Soundlink and it sounds great.  - Does everything the $179 echo can, with the exception of sound good, at a fraction of the price.    Cons:  - Internal speaker is poor. If you want it for music you need a good Bluetooth speaker = more cost.  - The mic seems less sensitive than regular echo. No science to back this up, just my impression. I feel like I repeat myself more with the Dot.  - When I have a Bluetooth speaker connected, if I say &quot;stop music&quot; it stops. Then I turn my speaker off.  The Dot starts playing again?  I have to turn the speaker off, wait a second for the audio to kick in on the dot, then tell dot to stop music.  Both ways should work, shouldn't they?  - Less immersive sound than regular Echo. The Bose Mini is directional.  If you are in front of the speaker it sounds great. Move to the sides and it looses some umph. While the regular Echo speaker doesn't sound as good as the Bose in optimal settings, because the regular Echo projects sound from all around it tends to fill a room better (while working in a garage or taking a shower for example)    Both are great deals, Dot is cool, just some differences to keep in mind and get what best meets your needs.    UPDATE:  OK with the Bluetooth speaker and stopping music issue I reference above, these are the steps I have to take to stop playing music and disconnect the speaker:  1. Say &quot;Echo, disconnect my speaker&quot;. (Note sometimes she gets confused and thinks I want to connect another speaker so I have to do this twice)  2. Once the speaker disconnects and music is now coming from Dot speaker, I say &quot;Echo, stop music&quot;    Again, if I stop the music then disconnect the speaker, Dot just starts playing music again.    Update 2: I moved my larger echo to the bedroom and put the Dot where larger echo used to be in the kitchen. A couple times per day I would get a &quot;sorry your Dot has lost connection&quot; messages from it while interacting with it. At first I thought it was defective, but I ended up moving it about 20 feet closer to the wifi router. Problem is now gone. Thus the range on the Dot is not as good as the regular echo. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 4, 2016 ",5.0,"Love my echo. Use it everyday. Paired it with my Logitech Harmony Hub and control most aspects of my TV with it. Also very useful for setting timers, telling you the weather in the morning when you are on the go, turning on and off the lights (with a proper bridge), NPR news updates and music streaming. ",
"handicapped shopper","October 24, 2016 ",4.0,"I just set up my Dot, and I like it quite a bit.  I just wish I knew more about using it. I want to set my alarms to wake me with music, but, after contacting Amazon, I found that you can't do that.  It also can't access my iPad calendar, so I can't ask if I have any appointments coming up. Amazon suggested an add on feature, but that didn't work, either.    I've had the Dot for over a week now and found it to be fun and useful, except when I ask it a question.  The answer I most often get is that she doesn't know the answer to that question.  I find that annoying.  Amazon help is there for you, but, after adding my new Phillips Hue lights, etc.  Amazon says I need to reboot my Dot to get it to answer my questions.  The first rep told me to unplug it and replug, and assured me that nothing would be lost.  The second rep told me to reboot, reconnect it to my WiFi and reregister with Amazon. THAT is REALLY annoying.  I sent a reply asking if that would require me to reconnect my Hue hub and lights.  I think the answer will be yes.  Annoying.    I was also told to use the voice recognition feature to train it to understand my voice.  Hmmm, it understands almost everything I say, and Siri understands me perfectly.  So......  I think it just didn't understand the words poinsettia and hallucinogenic.  Looking at the text of my questions in the app, Alexa understood me perfectly most of the time.  She just couldn't answer.    But, having said that, the Dot is new technology and Amazon is updating it all the time.  So, I'm relatively sure that these issues will be fixed.    It's doing a good job of giving me the weather, playing the music I request, and telling me kid friendly jokes.  It's doing a good job with turning my lights on and off, too, now that I set up my Philips Hub.    So, I look forward to using my Dot a lot in the future.  I love being able to use my voice to get things done and find information.  Great gadget for the elderly and disabled. ",
"James B Warren","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"works great. you can use it in the bedroom or the office, it has good sound. I used it with my Bose Wave when we had company.

"Brittany m","April 26, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought it as a gift for my mom. I figured instead of her asking me a Million questions she could ask Alexa, and that she does.

MD1983,"April 8, 2017 ",4.0,"Initially I was pretty excited about the Echo Dot, but found that it's quite limited in its functionality.  Basically I use it to set timers when I'm cooking, tell her to change the temperature on my Nest thermostat, sometimes to reorder stuff on Amazon, and to ask what the forecast is.  It is NOT like google where you can ask &#34;okay google, how long do I bake a potato?&#34; and it gives you an answer with time and temp for baking potato.  Alexa has no answers for you.  They keep emailing me cool things Alexa can now do, like give you funny answers to stupid questions, but I don't need her for entertainment.  I need hands free answers and directions.  There are some app type things you can download on her, like to order pizza from pizza hut or whatever, haven't used those.  Again, I just have a million random questions a day I need answers too, and she can't answer 9 out of 10 of them.  I bought 2 of these when they were on sale for xmas, and over time realized I didn't like them.  Too late to return, or I'd return them and get the google version.  Lastly, as I've become more and more disappointed by her presence, I get very angry if I ask her to do something and she doesn't hear me.  To avoid the anger, I just stay silent and get on my phone to do it, like change the temp using my Nest app.  It's like a sad, resentful marriage.  Why talk to you when I can just do it myself and avoid you? ",
"Paul Krauseneck","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"It just works, with very little if any learning curve. The amount of music playing in the house has increased 10 fold, which is a joy. The reason being it is you say &#34;Alexa, Play blah blah&#34; and it happens. No finding the phone, activating the phone, waiting for the app to open, typing in or scrolling. It is so easy, and now I have it hooked to my lights. No need to yell at the kids, just tell Alexa. Love it. ",
"phyllis b.","March 29, 2017 ",2.0,"I gave the echo a 4 star rating based on the product description. I must tell you that I LOVE this product, BUT, I wish the description would have told me that the sound with some artists are very soft. Sometimes this makes it hard to hear unless the TV is muted and there is no other noise in the background. As a result I am buying a Harmon Kardon speaker to link to the echo. Hopefully this will give me more  volume with the quality I'm looking for. I would certainly recommend getting a speaker of some sort with this product. ",
Texadian,"March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"Works great but probably won't recommend if you have kids.They'll figure out how to use it really quick and will drive you nuts with it. &#34;Alexa&#34; this and &#34;Alexa&#34; that, they'll be asking all the time, constantly. Fortunately the Dot is not rechargable, so just unplug it when not in use, and it won't do anything, or hit the mute button, where it wont hear anyone's voice do any commands. These two things can prevent the kids from using it. ",
"T.M White","April 2, 2017 ",4.0,"I really love the Echo Dot.  I made the purchase after my daughter got the Echo for Christmas. The set up was really easy. Connecting it to my Bose Bluetooth speaker was really easy and perfect. I have my Echo Dot sitting on top of my bed post and when I provide a command it replys.  I really like my Dot, and love that I can provide a command to play a certain playlist and it will play. ",
McCormick,"December 27, 2016 ",4.0,"Update from original post.  The Echo was working worse this morning.  I had to repeat commands several times to be understood.  After being away all day I came home and told the Echo to play a song and it didn't make a sound.  The light flashed on, then off again.  I rebooted it twice and had the same issue.  I am returning this product tomorrow and am no longer interested in the Echo.  I'm going to try Google's version of this product and see if I have better luck with them.    That was two weeks of mild entertainment.    Original post below:  This product is very limited on its capabilities and has difficulty understanding base commands.  It also struggles to find the appropriate song on a consistent basis.  Sometimes the product responds with inappropriate comments.  It is highly frustrating and I find it more convenient to use my cell phone to look up information or listen to music.  I regret being an early adopter of this product and find very little use for it other than setting alarms for cooking or as a paperweight.    I love Amazon and am a Prime member, but in my opinion they have far from excelled with this technology. ",
"Joseph A. Nickence","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I am so spoiled by my Dot. I've read different things about the Echo over the time it was initially introduced. But when my wife started taking notice, I knew I had to take the plunge. And I haven't regretted it. It is an awesome device, easy to set up, and work with. It has good voice recognition, and as there is a learning curve for the Echo, so is there one for us. She listens well, and we have learned what to say to make her respond appropriately. We are considering getting the Tap next! ",
FrostEternal,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Cool device, not worth $50, I had a gift card for $20, it IS worth $30 plus tax.     Amazon needs to step up the game on Alexa - when it works, it works, but much dumber than other AI assistants like Siri or Cortana, and ZERO sense of humor or personality. The skills are cumbersome, music playing support only works well with Amazon music unless you are streaming to it as a bluetooth speaker - which is dumb, as the speaker is not loud enough to hear over an air conditioner.    The Alexa platform is VERY open - which is cool BUT it means the available &#34;Skills&#34; are mostly very poor quality. For some reason the white Dot still comes with a black power cord, which is just more lack of attention to detail on Amazon's part. Sloppy, sloppy.    This is a must-have if you use any home automation - although the setup is VERY CLUNKY - expect hours of set up to get it just right if you want to change light colors or do anything more complex than switching smart devices on or off. There's a terrible interface for adding and forgetting devices in the companion &#34;app&#34; -  I use the term &#34;app&#34; VERY loosely - it's more of a sloppy wrapper on a webpage. Integrating with iOS is spotty at best without lots of workarounds and IFFFT recipes - pretty much essential - and theres no way to program custom words or commands beyond meager smart home groups and Stringify/IFFFT services. Alarms, timers, schedules - all poorly implemented - no way to have Alexa automatically announce reminders or alarms, just one ring tone that is set for all alerts. Commands have very little context and must be given one at a time - no way to say &#34;Alexa, dim my main lights and turn on the kitchen lights&#34; - she will just complain that she doesn't understand, or just ignore the command entirely.  HOWEVER - despite all these drawbacks I think they will EVENTUALY be ironed out. It's still a cool addition to a geeky home setup and with lots and lots of customization (and maybe even scripting one's own skills) it can be more useful than annoying.  Seriously though, Amazon - hurry up. ",

somesing2say,"April 14, 2017 ",3.0,"It's ok, but it's not how the comercial displays it. On the comerial you can ask anything & it finds an answer on a search engine (I assumed they had one that Alexa worked with). But, thats not how it works at all. 9 x's outta 10 it doesn't have an answer. There are certain learning &#34;bundles&#34; that you program her w/ to learn, but most of them have nothing to do with why I bought her (I thought I could ask her Warframe questions...it's a video game & she would be able to answer, but since there isn't any gaming &#34;bundles&#34;, much less warframe, it's nothing like I thought it would be or needed. I thought ok I'll just use it as the Alexa comercial showed, but nope not unless there is a &#34;bundle&#34; to teach it 1st. I hope they really take the time to create more general life &#34;bundles&#34; or hook it to a search engine that is says the answers outloud not give the answer to ur phone( every question asked goes to the controlling phone!) We can already talk & search our phones thru google. One last thing people should be aware of is that to hook her to outlets to make a smart home...you must have the newest phones out (a 2yr old LG is not good enough). Oh & one last thing, only one person can control it thru their phone, if u try to use more then 1 phone, u have to re-set it all over again!  So it's not what I expected, but I have hope for it, and since I didnt bye the $180 tower which is the same OS as the dot, its only a difference of a 360 speaker, but since I have the Dot, I'm going to keep it & hope it just keeps getting better.

LlamaCatastrophe,"March 25, 2017 ",5.0,"One of the greatest things that I've ever purchased! After more than two months I can safely say that I love my Echo-Dot. It connects perfectly with my Phillips Hue lights, GE Link lights, and is a clutch choice for an on demand DJ with Spotify, Pandora, or Prime Music! It's also great for hands free use while you're cooking in the kitchen. You know that one time when that one song you can't stand comes on as soon as you have your hands covered in food? Echo-Dot won't leave you hanging.    I mostly use mine for music and light control, and while the on board speaker is great for basic commands, do yourself a favor and hook it up to a Bluetooth speaker for the best experience. Echo-Dot is painless to set up out of the box and can find devices easily. I frequently switch up which Bluetooth speakers I'm using with at with a simple voice command, no additional pairing needed after the very first set up. Being able to purchase things directly from Amazon through Echo-Dot when you're thinking of it or adding items to a shopping list is great feature that I didn't believe I would use, but have come to absolutely love. That's my story with a lot of features, weather, traffic, news briefings, are all things that I thought were neat, but didn't appeal to me. Now that I have them I use them all the time and am constantly finding new things about Echo-Dot to love. There are always new apps to experiment with as Echo-Dot learns and grows which leaves me feeling like I've only scratched the surface of the help it can offer me in my day to day life. ",

"Robert E. Kleckner","February 9, 2017 ",5.0,"About two years ago I started with an Amazon Echo (full size) when they were on sale over a Christmas holiday.  I kept it about a week and returned it because I considered, at the time, that it was just an expensive toy.  About a year later, after reading more and more about what the Echo can do I decided to give it another try so I bought a refurbished Echo from Amazon at a $30 savings and I've been nothing but pleased with it ever since.  It's amazing what Amazon was about to do with it over that short period of time.  I have a 2000 square foot home with a separate home office, family room, kitchen nook, kitchen, master bedroom, etc, and found that this one Echo just wasn't cutting it so, when the new 2nd generation Echo Dot came out, and I read excellent reviews about it on Cnet and other publications, and it was only $49.99, I decided to preorder three of them from Amazon.  I now have an Echo in the family room, the kitchen, my office and the master bedroom and I couldn't be happier.  Even before I got the Dots, I set up my original Echo to control some things around the house. So far I only have been using smart plugs for lamps and certain appliances and everything is working fine.  When I received the Dots and got ready to set them up I realized that Amazon had already registered them to my Amazon account so all I had to do is put them where I wanted them, give them names so I could keep them straight, and connect them to my WiFi.  I had all three of the Dots connected in less than 15 minutes because everything was already done for me before I even received them.  With the new ESP software that Amazon has updated all the Echos with, I have no problems communicating with only one Echo at a time.  The one closest to me is the one that answers my slightest whim.  My next purchase will be the new Ecobee 3 Lite smart thermostat which will be controlled by Alexa.  I'm also experimenting with some ceiling lights, etc, but still deciding exactly which route to take.  Overall, I couldn't be happier with my Echo and Echo Dots.  Looking forward to more and more skills from Amazon. ",

It is so much more efficient then getting my phone, turning it on and typing the item on my list. I use the timer frequently when I am cooking.  As an Occupational therapist, I know this has many useful possibilities for those who have physical challenges.  I'm planning on purchasing one for my 90 year old Mother who has very limited vision.

"Khadem Imj","March 22, 2017 ",5.0,"After running for two months, now it has hearing issue. I have to call it at least 3 to 4 times before it actually respond. Plus I think it also has some pairing or connecting issue with smart devices such as TP-Link smart wifi plug. If I ask to turn on something, it doesn't do that these days and I actually have to repeat the command couple of times or sometimes I even have to restart it because it hangs, and after that it works. So ya, I think amazon still have to work a lot with its quality and AI algorithm. ",
"Mark A. Knowles","April 11, 2017 ",5.0,"This is an excellent addition to my toy collection, pretty much replacing my Chumba that has served me well over the years.  I just received it yesterday, and because the setup was difficult, that would be my first criticism and the explanation for 4 instead of the perfect score.  It took me a couple of hours + an actual chat with a very helpful customer service representative at 8:30 on a weekend morning – a chat that got me setup in a very short period of time (fyi, the problem was that my factory reset was incomplete last night – I had not pressed for a full 20 seconds on the two reset keys, and that has to happen to let the blue light go out).  But now that the Echo Dot is connected and registered, I'm just scratching the surface of all the power of this cute little device.  It comes with this very tempting offer for Amazon Music Unlimited for $3.99 per month – there's a free 30 day trial period that I've signed up for and am spinning up some pretty decent music with simple voice commands as I write this. My guess is that the Dot's other outstanding feature of commanding lights and other appliances connected to a smart network will be my undoing – the last remnants of my innocence and pride of being a hold-out against a Dick Tracy/Flash Gordon/James Bond world are precipitously being swept away.

"Amazon Customer","March 31, 2017 ",3.0,"I dont usually write reviews for products online but the echo dot is amazing.  I have it connected to all my samsung smartthings devices, my rainmachine lawn sprinkler system, and I just figured out how to hook it into my wifi/bt sony receiver and now i can command it to play my spotify songs and playlists through my stereo system.  All's i can say is WOW, and its so easy to use.  Oh, and all the other great things this thing can do asking it questions, weather, sports, etc.  I highly recommend this product. ",
Bryan,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Fun innovative product that allows us to listen to music and ask questions. I haven't even taken advantage of all the skills that can be installed. We use it without a bluetooth speaker - i.e. we use the built in speaker. The built in speaker is relatively weak, but sufficient for kids listening. Also I can get my daily news briefing. ",
"dennis whitehead","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Very nice she gives you the news, weather, sings to you if asked, tells jokes if asked, listen to music when you ask and a lot of other fun things. What i didn't know is you can run your lights and control the temperature with in your home. Never thought I'd own one, but being alone most of the day gives me something to do. LOL ",
"Art Vandelay","February 11, 2017 ",5.0,"Can not express how much $50 dollars has changed my life.  I use this thing for everything.  Connected to LIFX lights and control entire house.

This thing is worth much more than you buy it for. ",
"Hawaii Chris","March 9, 2017 ",5.0,"I really enjoyed this product for the first month, which happened to correlate with the warranty period. I am now at the beginning of month 3 and it no longer plays music or audiobooks as it &#34;cannot find the music/book&#34;. I pay for an audible membership and amazon music, the latter being a compete waste of money, but they apparently do not work consistently. ",
"Continuum B.","March 12, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa, what's good for heartburn?    I cannot believe such a basic question cannot be answered for Alexa. Thankfully, I have google assistance enable in my phone, and the answer was right on point. I spent more time listening to Alexa telling me that I cannot find the answer to this question...Really?  Although, I have started this review on a negative note, one can say that Alexa is full of potential, and if given the right access,and the right contents ( not Bing search) Alexa should be able to do more.    I just don't want Alexa to turn on my light, or activate my heating system, I want Alexa to be able to answer the most basic questions. If Alexa is unable to answer a question, she should be able to perform an internet search, and come back with an answer.    An example of the above will be: Alexa, how to care for Money tree Plants?  I cannot find the answer to this question.    Even though Alexa was unable to find the answer, I was hoping that she was giving the ability to search the world wide web, and come back with the answer,  not just saying that I cannot find the answer to this question.    The Artificial intelligence market gadget is getting more competitive everyday, with Google and soon Apple entering the market, Alexa has a lot of catching up to do, and will need to keep up. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 2, 2017 ",2.0,"We got it for our 94 year old parents who constantly ask the time or day or weather. It has been great! They love asking &#34;her&#34; questions. We put their appointments on the Calendar and they can ask about the day's plans.  We put a card with ALEXA over the Dot (maybe &#34;Dot&#34; would have been a good name) to help them remember the name. Our only complaint is that it doesn't respond well to &#34;Alexa Stop&#34;. We've had to unplug it to get it to stop alarms or music.  We all like it. ",
Donna,"April 9, 2017 ",3.0,"Probably get a better review it I had was in a house with all of the internet functionality needed to fully exploit Alexa's capabilities. Not bad, but I'll be waiting a while before investing in another so the tech can evolve. Very occasionally Alexa will decide she's heard something that she needs to respond to and all she's heard is the background noise of the TV. Could be dangerous if internet shopping functionality was enabled..... ",
Stephanie,"April 19, 2017 ",4.0,"I love this!!! Because of this, I no longer need to set an alarm on my phone. I can say &#34;Alexa&#34; and she lights up. I can create a to do list, ask for the weather, set an alarm, you can also tell it to tell you jokes or stories, play games, etc. There are many things that Alexa can do. Discovering what she can do is so much fun! ",
"Addie B.","March 18, 2017 ",3.0,"My family and I love Alexa! Its like having another person in the house. Every morning I ask her what the weather is and she gives me the information that I need.

"Roman Pennington","April 17, 2017 ",5.0,"Fun device, but not so impressed with blue tooth connectivity and obfuscated error messages.    UPDATE:  One very annoying problem is, if Amazon's system is down for any reason, these devices will not let you know.  Today, I could not play music.  There was some system down outside of my network, and the Dot just refused to do anything.  It should report some sort of problem so that we aren't rebooting our devices, fiddling with them, the app, etc. trying to find out what's wrong.  These things are smart enough to provide more details but they do not. ",

Stoffel,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"This is an awesome device! Way better than the Google Home. Alexa can do so much more than Google. I had a Google for over 6 months and I've been waiting for updates but nothing has come yet. I love Google but their Home device is a huge disappointment. ",
Thomas,"December 11, 2016 ",3.0,"We Love the Echo DOT.  We use it in the Bedroom every night listening to music before going to bed.  Also we use it to control the heat / AC and lighting across the house(s) - yes will control smart devices in multiple locations / states if on the same Alexa account.  Great Alarm clock / count down timer, etc. We have multiple Dots across the house and an Echo in the main rooms. ",
cantu3l,"April 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Got this on January 5th, and it worked perfectly the first few weeks-- even picking up and understanding what my 3 and 5 year olds were saying to it. Gradually, we noticed that Alexa was not hearing us as well. First, she stopped understanding what we were asking. Then, she just couldn't hear us at all, even with no background noise whatsoever. We would have to yell and repeat ourselves many times in order for it to hear and understand us, when before, I could be sitting in the living room (Alexa in the kitchen) and speak in a low conversational voice and it would pick up what i was saying.    Today, i used the wake word many times without Alexa waking up. Finally i had to hold it in my hand and basically yell into it in order for it to register and respond.    I am really upset at the decline of the quality of this product. Unfortunately I am now past the return window so I am unable to exchange it. I am still going to contact Amazon to see what they can do. ",
Taylor,"March 29, 2017 ",5.0,"Silly. You probably don't need one but if you want one get it. I use it to play music at night. I wish I could connect it to my local library on my computer but its a bit lacking. I wish it could do more useful things instead of silly things like tell jokes and play word games.    EDIT: It picks up its own name sometimes when other names are said. DONT buy this is your name is alex or have friends who you talk about ever named alex. It will disconnect from the wifi at night and then give you a very loud audible update saying its reconnected to the wifi. I stopped using this after it woke me up several nights in a row. It's not a great product right now. Not worth buying even at this price. ",
Annaswilder,"March 10, 2017 ",2.0,"After about a month with Alexa....I still love her! I still have a difficult time remembering what skills she has.

I thought we would understand each other, help each other, be there for each other, but instead, you tell me that you cant help me more often than you tell me you can. You refuse to set an alarm for me, you wont keep my schedule. I ask you for a recipe, you tell me to go look for it somewhere else. I ask you to make a list for me, you tell me to make it myself. I dont know what I ever saw in you. I thought you cared about me and wanted to actually help me keep track of my busy life, but you seem only willing to play a few songs, and tell me things I already know, like the weather and time... I will say this about you, you certainly help me to spell words and do some simple math...maybe there is a future for us, maybe over time, you'll grow to understand my needs better, all I can do is wait and see...wait and see....

I placed mine in the bedroom to conveniently listen to Spotify & Pandora, along with getting weather and news reports.  A major drawback for me is that 3rd-party skills don't connect to Microsoft Outlook services (only Google).  There are several hundred million outlook.com users that would like to review their email and calendar so this is a big gap in coverage. ",

She's up to date on news and sports but has a hard time recognizing questions.

Kristin,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"We have had a great experience with the Echo Dot so far.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone that plans on connecting to a nice bluetooth speaker or an A/V system because the speaker that is built in works okay to hear Alexa talk but when playing music it sounds like a tin can.  Fortunately for us we connected it to our surround sound receiver as an analog input via a 3.5mm to RCA cable.  I installed the Logitech Harmony skill (the red one) and connected the dot to my Harmony Hub and it has been working out really well.  The one drawback of not using the Dot's built in speaker is you need to have whatever system you are using for sound turned on and the volume to a good level - the Harmony Hub resolves this issue for me.  I programmed an activity I named &#34;Sound&#34; through the harmony app that switches my receiver on and changes to the correct audio input.  Now I say &#34;Alexa, Turn on the Sound&#34; and I can hear the Echo Dot on my surround sound system.  Or the kid's favorite &#34;Alexa, Turn on the Xbox&#34; which is usually followed by me saying &#34;Alexa, Tell Harmony to Mute&#34;.    The Echo Dot also works Really well with the Phillips Hue hub and was very simple to set up.  Being able to walk in to my dark home and say &#34;Alexa, turn on the Living Room Light&#34; and have the light immediately turn on is awesome.  And so far - it works without fail! ",
"Amazon Customer","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Love this little device. I've been using the Amazon Fire Line for a while now and I have to say this Amazon Echo Dot is by far the most useful device. I could CONFIRM that you DO NOT need the Amazon Echo in order to work this Amazon Echo Dot. Setup for this device was a breeze. Just plug in the power cable to the unit and download the Amazon Alexa app and you're all done. Not only can you use this device to play music but you could use it to set alarms. The microphone on this unit is really good and it can hear you from across the room. I've used this frequently when I cook, it makes it so easy to set multiple times for certain foods. It even tells you the recipe for the meals too. This little device is small and sleek and does not take up space at all. We use this device to check the weather every morning before heading out. There is so many things this little device could do, we hooked up our Nest Thermostat to this and control our heating unit all through voice command. This little unit carries LOTS of potential, there are so many other things we connected this unit to, we are currently controlling our house lights with this all by saying &#34;Alexa, Living room on&#34; and the TV by &#34;Alexa turn on TV&#34;. Although the living room lights and TV functionality requires an additional add on equipment I still think this is pretty cool and is one step away from Jarvis from Iron Man. ",
Sam,"January 14, 2017 ",5.0,"Literally the best little nightstand device. Thought it was mostly hype but decided to get one because its so damn cheap. I hooked it up to some old speakers and use it as a podcast and music player and alarm clock. It also hooked up to my smart home devices pretty simply. I show it off to everyone who will pay attention. ",
"Marvin Lipschitz","January 6, 2017 ",5.0,"Initially, I fell in love with this device.  When I tried to interface with Insteon, (the original reason for the purchase), I had difficulties. There was no specific information of how to speak to Alexa to get the lights to respond. I spent an enormous time reading how to setup Insteon and Alexa after it was set up. The information that I was looking for was not available.  I am still not quite sure what works. I have finally figured out what to name scenes to get Alexa to control the lights.  There were no instructions that really helped. Lots of instructions that provided no useful syntax information. Secondly, I have a whole house audio system.  I would have bought multiple Echo Dots if I could use one of them for the output of all of them.  I will cancel my new subscription to the music in favor of my Airport Extreme. From my iPhone I can choose any of the airport extremes to output to. One of them is in a closet with my whole house audio system.  I figured I could have 4 ethos in the house and could have them all output to a single source. Nope, so, I really have no reason to own more than 1 echo dot. It will only be used in my bedroom hooked up to a separate Speaker System. Can I use my phone as a control, no. Can I use my Music Subscription on more than one Dot, no. Does the remote work without pressing a button, no.  So, if your system was designed with flexibility I would own 4 Echo Dots and a music subscription.  Instead I will never own more than one Dot and no Music Subscription. ",
"Kenneth E. Martin","April 23, 2017 ",5.0,"The Amazon Echo Dot is a LOT of FUN. I love asking questions, and hearing silly replies. My favorite is to ask Alexa to play music by genre. I learn new artist that I hadn’t known before. I will never use the ordering ability as I am not likely to order laundry detergent, paper towels, or mouth wash. Kind of a waste here.  My biggest issue is, if you want to listen to music, which is the Dot’s forte, you HAVE to pay for a Amazon Prime account. I am not going to do this.  The gift I bought for my wife, an Echo Dot, is limited to answering questions that may or may not be in the Alexa database, and she is denied any ability to play music other than what she already paid for on Amazon. I wanted to keep my Amazon account separate from my wife’s, but due to that, she can’t get anything from Amazon, even though I bought this for her and set it up under her profile.  So, the Dot is cool, but it is designed to make money for Amazon. (Duh) The problem is, if you buy one, and expect to get what is promised on the page, you also HAVE TO BUY a Prime account. So, Amazon pretends that there is no subscription fee for using a Dot, or any other Tap or Echo device, but bear in mind that it is not something worth buying if you are not the Prime Account Holder. It is so limited that it is worthless.  Google does NOT require all of this paid membership stuff. ",
"John Classen","November 20, 2016 ",3.0,"Does exactly the same thing that the largest Echo does. Only the speaker size is different. The quality is still adequate for music. If you are a music quality snob then you still have the option of hooking it up to your stereo or whatever. I have purchased both the Echo and the Dot. The Dot is a real bang for the buck compared to the original Echo. The Tap (middle-sized) is the one that is slightly different than the original Echo or the Dot. I don't have a Tap, but I hear it has a docking/charging station; the advantage of that is that it can run unplugged using batteries; the Echo and Dot don't have that feature.    Cons:  Most of the special features like ordering a Dominos pizza are not as cool as you'd think. They are very limited in their flexibility/options.  These are typically add-on installations you ask Alexa to setup for you or you can setup using your android device or Kindle.  Alexa typically has problems answering anything other than the most basic questions.    Pros:  Listen to music (you can &#34;pause&#34;, &#34;resume&#34;, ); ask about weather, calendar events, basic facts, wikipedia topics; setup reminders, timers, shopping list, calendar events. Alexa can read books too, but I haven't mastered that; I'm not sure if you need Kindle Unlimited for that or not.  My nephews' favorite add-on app: &#34;Ask for a Fart&#34;. ",
"Jeff D.","December 27, 2016 ",2.0,"What can I add that hasn't been said by 10K reviewers?  I was really touched by the reviewer who got the Dot for his relative with MS; just beautiful.  I think the simplicity of the whole platform is what impresses me the most.  All you need is the four or five Post-It-sized instructional pages to get up and running.  I didn't do any voice training, and yet Alexa hears me and responds from two rooms away!  The $3.99 Music Unlimited deal per month with a free trial is perhaps an even better deal than the incredibly cheap price of the unit itself.  I shared it with some friends over Christmas and they all want one.  Truly an amazing piece of hardware/software integration.  Congratulations Amazon! ",
"Amazon Customer","January 2, 2017 ",5.0,"So far the Dot has done what it has been asked of. It recognizes my voice commands perfectly, but I have not fully utilized all the functionality as of yet. My one concern is the power adapter is an issue. Why could it not be either a slim design or a right angle to it. Putting this behind a dresser or bed causes the USB cable to bend. Is there a compatible Power Adapter that can be purchased? I would have given this product 5 stars if it wasn't for this. ",
Zoey,"January 2, 2017 ",5.0,"Love, love, love my echo dot! The set up was extremely easy for the dot, and is exactly what I was looking for! I originally was unsure if I actually needed the echo dot, but I am so glad I decided to try it it! I bought the dot to use with my Nest thermostat and Philips Hue lights. The set up of the dot with these two systems only took 5 minutes max, and it works perfectly. Now I just tell Alexa to turn my thermostat down or up, and she does it no problem! The same with the Philips Hue lights. On top of that, I did not even know half of the other things Alexa can do and how easier some things can be thanks to this product! Instead of trying to remember what groceries I needed when shopping, I now just tell Alexa to add something to my shopping list at the moment I realize I need to buy more! This has helped reduce those &#34;I forget..&#34; trips back to the grocery store!!! Additionally, she can set timers or alarms for whatever reason, tell you the weather, update you on what you have planned on your calendar for that day, and SO MUCH MORE!!! I found the dot so helpful, that I even purchased a second one for the bedroom. She even reads a bedtime story to my 4 year old son at night, which he just finds so funny because the main character of the story is him! Overall, this is a GREAT product and a must for those looking to help make daily life a little bit more easy! ",
"Shaina T.","November 27, 2016 ",4.0,"I love my Amazon Echo. I use it as an alarm clock and to turn my lights on and off. I hated walking to the bed with out the lights on, or having to get up because I forgot to turn them off. This is the sole perpose I bought the device. And it works wonderfully. I like to play music on it when I clean too. I bought everyone an echo for Christmas. My brother's review was. &#34;I like, it I love it, I'll use it, I won't even try to sell it.&#34; ",
"Amazon Customer","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"While the Echo Dot has improved my living experiences with its connectivity, there are some shortfalls that have prevented me from rating it higher. For one, the answering capabilities are severly lacking and Alexa struggles to answer even the basic questions like &#34;When did Lost boys come out in theaters?&#34; or &#34;Who sings X song&#34;    It's other downfall is its lag. Sometimes I'll ask it to turn off lights and will get a response almost immediately, but other times it will just blank or take a minute to trigger the lights.    Currently it's best feature is playing music through bluetooth. Always great for doing chores or getting ready for work. If the answering mechanism was better it'd get 5 stars, and it's definitely worth having for the price, but it still doesn't beat out google in searches ",
CHUCKFM,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I've been looking for programming info that is paper based for Alexa & haven't found much of anything at amazon.

What am I missing? ",
Twinrocks,"January 10, 2017 ",3.0,"I am enjoying my Dot and still learning what all it will do.  My only complaint is that sometimes it cannot answer what I feel is a simple question such as &#34;Alexa, what is the 5th largest city in the Untied States&#34;? She did not know.  Other than things like that, it's fun and useful to have around. ",
"Lori A. Bourgault","April 19, 2017 ",3.0,"I like things quiet, but dot is way too quiet.. dot volume 10 is equal to Alexa volume 3, it is truly meant for a very small area like a bedroom    Need more name selections to wake it.  Needs to have the ring on top like Alexa, to control volume. The little volume buttons are annoying to try to hit the right one without looking.  Sometimes you have to try to wake it multiple times be it does what you ask.    Alexa (I have both) is far better. ",
Joe,"January 26, 2017 ",4.0,"Love this! The dot takes up less space and does everything the echo does.

I look forward to new innovations as they are offered. ",
AReview4U,"March 20, 2017 ",3.0,"UPDATE TO REVIEW BELOW:  I have 3 of these set up in my house.  I've already had to exchange one because it quit working.  Now 2 of the other 3 all of a sudden can NEVER hear you - you have to yell at it, whereas before they all worked just fine.  ALSO, I ask/tell it to do something, like turn off a light, and it gives me an answer that is totally unrelated to anything even close to the words I've said.  I'm beginning to think maybe I should try that other one of these things that are out there by another company because these are not holding up.  ALSO, out of the blue I am simply sitting on my couch BY MYSELF surfing the net, and all of a sudden she starts talking for no reason whatsoever.  I do not have the tv on; I'm not talking to myself; so WTF!  I'm becoming less and less enamored with this product, and I've bought about 10 of them - 3 for myself, 2 for my boyfriend and the others I've given out for gifts or plan to (Christmas is almost here).  I normally don't rag on something on here BUT I've bought enough of these that they better not all start messing up, like 2 of my 3 are already doing.  Who wants to have to yell at something for it to respond - AND OH, just so you know, I'm standing with 6' of it - I'm not 50' away.  RIGHT NEXT TO IT and I get NOTHING.  Then I yell, and all of a sudden the stupid thing responds.  Did I mention I was ANNOYED!!!    I received my Echos timely and packaged well.  I am in LOVE with this little thing.  It works perfectly for me so far.  I have had a time or 2 when it simply would spin and not respond, but not enough to cause me to want to return it. I have one in my living room and one in my bedroom.  While it does reach out, for me, I don't want to have to yell to it from a distance.  Also, it connected to my Samsung bluetooth soundbar instantly (even though my speaker is not on the &#34;approved&#34; list you see here on Amazon).  It has come in so handy numerous times, like asking a quick question I have without having to pull out the tablet or phone to look it up; I have intergrated my google calendar so it will tell me what's on the schedule for the day or week.  I have also integrated the music from my Samsung S7 and it plays all my music as soon as I ask it to.  I have it hooked up to my Hue lights, and it works great from Alexa's standpoint - the Hue lights are a hit or miss as they often keep losing the connection to the bridge - even with the light in the same room as the router.  If this doesn't stop, they'll be going back because at $200 for my Hue kit, these things should not keep losing a connection and becoming undiscoverable - BUT, that has nothing to do with the Alexa.  If you don't have one of these, I highly recommend it.  It is handy as can be and ONLY $49.  What a dream gadget.  MY ONE SUGGESTION IS THIS THOUGH.  IT IS AN AMAZON DEVICE SO WHY DOESN'T IT HAVE A SKILL TO TURN ON OUR AMAZON FIRESTICK!!! ",
"Honest John","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"Worth it just to have my grocery list available at all times and to turn my bedroom light on before I even enter the room. My husband loves it because he can add items to it while I'm grocery shopping and doesn't have to call or text me. My granddaughter loves it because she has a partner to quiz her on subjects she learning in school--state capitals and US Presidents. ",
"Otniel Gonzalez","October 26, 2016 ",2.0,"This device is sooo disappointing!  It rarely answers anything I can easily just say &#34;Ok Google&#34; on my phone and find an automated response.  I have even added all apps I found useful and it is just a pain in the ass to get then to work since you have to remember all these special command syntax in order to activate the app you want information from.  I wanted it mainly so we could do things like...ask movie or tv show information, look up facts and other things.  And above all....I wanted to be able to control lights with it.  Now I have to be honest in saying I have yet to buy the corresponding light bulbs or light switches for them to work with Alexa because they are so expensive...but frankly I would highly recommend buying Google Home over this piece of crap!  Sorry Amazon...I love you guys...but this device needs a major overhaul!!!! ",

"Brent S. Ferguson","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"All-New Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - White    My wife's a technophobe - I had to actually work to get a smartphone into her hands.  Now that she's learned to use it though, and voice recognition, wow - I can't pry it out of her fingers!  Why would I mention this in the Dot II review?  The dot is another such piece of technology.    You might not want to learn the new skills to 'talk to' it, but once you do, you just love it!    Please note, Amazon sometimes offers the dot at a 1/4 price reduction if you order it WITH A DOT.  Don't buy more than one even if you want one in each room.

"Timothy Sobocinski","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"So, we have been wanting Echo for a while.  We have other Amazon products in our house, a Fire TV, two Fire sticks, and a couple Kindles.  Since my old radio alarm clock was dying I decided that I would replace it with a dot, and it is wonderful.  I have it play me classical music to help me get to sleep and Alexa will play it on a sleep timer when asked.  I can set daily alarms, so no longer do I need to set and unset the alarm every morning.  She can run multiple alarms.  Also you can change the sound of the alarm, this is nice because after a while my alarm noise will start being like nails on the chalk board after a while.  Since she is in the bedroom where I get dressed she can give me a briefing of headline news from CNN and weather so I know how to dress for the day.  I do plan on getting Wemo switches for some of the lights in my house that I shut off before going to bed to link up, especially my bed side light, which my wife has forced on me as a job to shut off at night, so now I can give it to Alexa.  Never figured the bedroom would be a good place for Alexa but she works well there.  The little puck fits into the contemporary styling of our room.  One complaint about using Dot as an alarm clock, it has no face so you have to ask the time.  This is bad if you are the first one to wake you might not know the time, so it is hard to tell if you should roll over and go back to sleep, or get up.  Dot is easy to setup at least, and I am planning on more.  So, I would say I am happy with my purchase. ",
"The Headhunter","December 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I have one of the original Echoes -- bought it sight unseen when Amazon offered it to a few Prime customers for $99. I'd never give it up. Bought two Dots for our house and love them.    PROS: The mini-jack lets you use your own external speakers, unlike the Echo. It just works! It's a less costly version of the Echo.  CONS: There's no ring on the top you can turn to control volume like on the Echo -- I really love that Echo feature. But the buttons you get instead aren't bad.    Some find this product confusing. It does exactly what the Echo does for less. It has its own speaker, but not as big or good as the Echo's. But it's still good enough. On the upside, you can attach it to any speakers or amp you want using a mini jack and cable.    If you still don't understand what Echo and Dot are all about, JUST BUY ONE! Get the Dot. You'll love it. I have one in the bathroom. I listen to the news while shaving, music while in the shower, check the weather report, and play a round of Jeopardy with Alexa every day. I also make lists of things I need to do while I'm still in the bathroom.    We now have one Echo in the kitchen, and a Dot in each of two bathrooms. We love Alexa! Haven't even tried using the &#34;home controls&#34; features with lights, etc yet -- but we will.    Amazon has a real winner here! ",
"D. Mahar","November 6, 2016 ",5.0,"5 stars for the incredible value and innovation of this system.  Similar to Siri and Google, but it's much more functional and designed to work with other devices in your home.  Play music, set timers, alarms, control lights &amp; thermostat, ask questions, get information and install specific 'skills' which act like voice activated apps.  For this stage in the game, it's pretty darn clever and it's going to continue to improve.  Amazing work Amazon!    Wish list for future updates:  - Conversation mode.  When I'm testing the limits of what Alexa can understand, it gets old saying 'Alexa' every time I have a new question to ask.  It would be easier to say 'Alexa, start conversation mode' and then everything I said afterward would be recognized.  - Answers to more questions.  I'm already very impressed by how much I can get away with asking, but there's still a lot to be learned.  Amazon isn't a search engine so they are at a disadvantage, but somehow they will have to continue to make strides in this department to stay competitive.  - More interactive.  This sort of goes back to my 'conversation mode' suggestion but I imagine more difficult to implement.  It would mean asking me followup questions or some other interactive responsiveness.  Maybe I've been watching too many tv shows about AI...but hey, a guy can dream right ",
John,"January 14, 2017 ",4.0,"This thing is nice, but its just gimmicky. I think it has a future, but we kind of got tired of it after a few weeks.

I know voice AI is the future, but I would wait unless you are a tech person. ",

You are also able to create groups of lights and name them for the different parts of your house.

"Jana Bianco","March 30, 2017 ",2.0,"Not sure how I really feel about this product yet.

"P. Robichaux","February 3, 2017 ",5.0,"Warning: you may have a desire to replace all your light switches with Smart switches and put one of these in every room. Maybe one day...    When you have 3 little girls that rarely do what you ask them to, Alexa is a dream. I use her to turn off the Christmas lights paired to a TP-link smart outlet. Also, with Amazon Music Unlimited she plays anything I was to hear. When not paired to a speaker, you can hear her just fine, although I mostly have her Bluetooth connected to a portable Bose speaker. I much prefer the Dot over the big Echo as you can pair her with any speaker you want, and she's much easier to move around the house if you want to bring her someplace else. She can hear surprisingly well even from far distances as long as she has a clear-ish line of sight even with a lot of other background noise.    My only complaint is I wish she did more. I constantly find myself asking questions that she doesn't know the answer such as, &#34;What channel is the Wisconsin Badgers playing on tonight?&#34; Using a Nexus 5x and saying OK Google, usually brings up what I need as the first result, but it doesn't say it back to me. I am a bit curious if Google Home is better at answering quick questions, but I chose the Dot since it was much cheaper and integrates with Amazon Music. Hopefully Echo's get smarter as time goes on.

"Amazon Customer","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Received my first six pack of Echo dots, one for each of the kids and older grandchildren for Christmas and of course one for me.  Was first introduced to the taller Alexa at my cousins house and was impressed.  But the price was a little out of range and when I saw the Echo dot and read the reviews I couldn't stop myself especially at this price. For the price it is an outstanding value.  Easy to set up and I learn more about it each day.  In fact waiting for another six pack to be delivered because I decided to give two to each household plus one each to the older (10 and above) grandchildren.  Which is perfect becauseChristmas shopping almost done and I think I got the &#34;hot&#34; item for the year.  Excited they will continue to add new features to the Echo.  I almost feel like. I need to say &#34;good morning&#34; and &#34;goodnight&#34; to it each day.  I did have some problems getting my calendar synced with it but had prompt live instant help from representative who gave outstanding service and we finally figured out my email account was different for each item.  I most definitely would recommend buying from Amazon instead of third party just for their outstanding support. For a little chuckle, the other night when I was messing with the Alexa (Echo) app in another room, I was checking out what books it could read to me and didn't realize when I tested one book the Echo had started reading it...when I went into the room where Echo was ... there it was still reading the book...must have been a good book.

mikemac9,"December 6, 2016 ",5.0,"The big pluses for this compared to devices from other vendors are (1) he wider support for 3rd party apps and devices  (2) more attractive price.  At less than half the price of competing units and only $50 (even less on sale) you're not making a huge purchase here even if you only use it for a year or so.  And if you have a connected home or use some supported apps like OurGroceries you can start using it now.    A big minus is that the artificial intelligence from Amazon just isn't where the competition is in terms of quality.  Ask Alexa &#34;What is the best way to reheat turkey?&#34; or &#34;what is the Amazon stock price?&#34;, to give but 2 examples, and Alexa can not answer.  Try this on your smartphone with Siri or Google and you get answers. And that's the rub.  Once you have a device like this you want to just speak and get answers instead of reaching for your phone.    You can extend the functionality of the device by enabling &#34;skills&#34;, pieces of software written for Alexa.  But even this is half-baked.  Keep a list of what you have enabled, because there doesn't seem to be any way on the Amazon website or by asking Alexa to see what you have enabled!    This device does a decent amount, but the competition does more in terms of general queries.  Bottom line, this is a nice device and I'm glad I got it.  But I don't know if this is a product line that will have legs. ",

"Carla E. Malone","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I love my larger Echo.  It works great.  I have it in my kitchen and it picks up from across the room.  I purchased the dot to go in my bedroom for use as my alarm clock.  It performs very poorly.  I bought this a few months ago but unfortunately we were moving so it got boxed up and we are just now unpacking it and using it for about a month now.  (So we can no longer return it)  When the alarm goes off and I YELL snooze, it does not pick up my response.  I literally have to get out of bed, go to the dresser and put my mouth 6 inches from it for it to respond.  We moved it to the nightstand.  Still about the same.  I have to lean over and across the nightstand for it to hear me.  That may sound lazy, but why else buy something voice activated?  Also we have the WeMo's for our lamps.  They work great with my Echo.  The echo dot is very spotty.  I have to ask it 3 or 4 times to turn on/off the lamp before it does.  Often it will respond ok but then does nothing.  Completely annoying.  The sound it terrible btw.  Granted it is not a speaker like the Echo, but still... it's crappy.  We have 2 Echo's that work great.  The Dot was a waste of money for us.

"Dan S. Tong","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I changed my 5 star review to 1 star. To find out why please read the section labeled EDIT UPDATE.    I really like the Echo device, but it took me way to long to get the Echo configured because the instructions and menu's are extremely poor, to put it mildly.    THE PROBLEMS  1. First, the instruction fail to say whether the app to download is for iPhone, Android, PC or Mac.  I assumed it would be safest to use my  Android smartphone, but after downloading and attempting to install I got a message which basically said -this app is incompatible the smartphone. My smarphone  is compatible with every App I have downloaded. Because I hate Win8, 8.1 and 10 I still use Windows 7 which does not support &#34;Apps&#34;, which is why I did not attempt to use my PC for downloading the &#34;App&#34;.    2.  Setup menu is also horrible, and confusing. For example for the setting of metric vs other does not really give a choice, it has an On Off button which does not appear to do anything.  It certainly does not  bring up an edit menu.  It should really simply have metric vs foot (units) so that you simply put a check mark to the one you want. Same for Celsius vs Fahrenheit  As a consequence I still get Celsius when I want Fahrenheit etc.  This is because of an extremely useless, frustrating  User Interface.    3. The Echo froze once or twice, so I had to unplug it and I had to start all over, until eventually it decided that it was fully setup.    It should have had an interface like most Routers, which you configure by browsing to the device, which brings up a menu that you configure.    If you have not setup an Echo before, you should be aware that once you run the &#34;App&#34; which is downloaded from the internet, you then have to disconnect from your wifi network, and instead connect to amazon-net (I don't remember the exact name) which then allows your smartphone, tablet or laptop etc. to connect your Echo (this of course means that you are no longer connected to the internet).    Other than the setup, the Echo v 2 is excellent, with  wonderful text to speech conversion that is the best I have ever heard.  The one thing missing is the ability to retain the very last task before it is unplugged when you take it to another location. I especially like that you can connect to any radio station, ask for any radio program (Fresh Air, Science Friday, Ted Talk, The Moth, Back Story etc. It's also great to ask about anything that is on Wikipedia. Finally, to my surprise the text to speech on Wikipedia, as well as on Kindle books is far better than I expected, far less like a robot, than what I heard in the past.    Edit UPDATE 3/1/2017:  (reason why I changed my rating from 5 star to 1 star)  As others have said while the device works well at first, over time everything about the device starts growing disappointing.  Here are my reasons  1.  Radio programs such as Freakonomics (via TuneIn) is no longer available  2.  Radio programs that always used to be up to date Fresh Air, Science Friday, On the Media, etc. are no longer up to date. Whenever you request them you get one weeks older and they newer broadcasts are way out of date if available at all. A lot of programs available on TuneIn cannot be accessed via Echo Dot.    Echo Malfunctions:  1. Echo turns on for no apparent reasons as if someone said Alexa in the room. This problem was non existent or extremely rare for the first 2-3 months.    3. Echo does not appear to understand request nearly as well as when it was new. Sometimes re-phrasing the request for the 3rd or 4th time works, but often I we just give up. This is especially true of requesting playing Audible titles.  Echo Dot often confuses Kindle text to speech version with the Audible (human / actor reading of text). With all of the &#34;Continual Improvement&#34; hoopla about Alexa that Amazon brags about, you would think that you could request a book title and get what you want for existing books in your Account.    4. You would think that if,  while listening, you are interrupted by a phone call etc., you should be able to have Alexa, go back a page or two in the reading of your Kindle or Audible book. This function appears to be ABSENT and no matter how we tried we could not go forward or back by any amount other than by an entire Chapter.  This is not Rocket Science and could easily be programmed. Pages do exist even on Kindle, it's a simple matter of assigning a &#34;page&#34; a standard number of words or characters.    5. Often, though not always, if you unplug Echo Dot, in order to use it in another room, it will lose information about what it was doing (what book it was reading). This should not happen and would not be difficult to prevent.    IN SUMMARY  Instead of constantly IMPROVING, Echo Dot functionality has actually declined in our experience as reported by others. This calls into question the competence of the Amazon Software Team. Sadly, like too many things in the computer world, stupidity too often overcomes common sense competence. ",
"Samuel C.","March 29, 2017 ",5.0,"I'm frankly surprised that the Echo has become such a success for Amazon, even as the company has cut back on &#34;high-end&#34; tablets (the Fire HDX tablets) in favor of the slower but super-affordable Fire HD tablet, which can exert a near-hypnotic hold on its young recipient.    As a grandparent, I finally separated my two &#34;world's greatest granddaughters&#34; from their dangerously addictive personal screens. It's one thing if newly empowered youngsters are playing video games, but a game like &#34;Minecraft&#34; appears to keep its fans spellbound as they're watching two &#34;virtual players&#34; playing the game. But we adults are equally susceptible when, night after night, we watch crime dramas in which the main characters are watching blown-up screens of criminals and their locations while we, in turn, are drawn to the screen within the screen. Since reading about the deliberate use of this device by content providers whose job is to pump viewer ratings, I've become conscious of the chunks of time I devote to watching my heroes watching screens! &#34;NCIS,&#34; &#34;Law and Order,&#34; &#34;CSI,&#34; &#34;Criminal Minds&#34; (I applaud Mandy Patinkin for jumping this rat-infested ship), &#34;The Blacklist,&#34; &#34;Bull&#34; (Michael Weatherly's show sets the record for number of screens, as he acknowledged one night to Colbert).    Enter the past and the invention that once shaped a nation: the radio. Existing somewhere between the screen and the book is the loud-speaker, that 20th-century invention responsible for introducing America to its foremost stars (Crosby, Sinatra, Benny, Dinah, etc.) and to the unequaled composers and songs of &#34;The Great American Songbook.&#34;  And some of us our old enough to remember the fingernail-biting entertainment every night on radio--&#34;The Green Hornet,&#34; &#34;Jack Armstrong,&#34; &#34;Captain Midnight,&#34; &#34;Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders,&#34; &#34;The Lone Ranger,&#34; &#34;The Gene Autry Show.&#34;    This material was &#34;non-visual&#34; only in the most literal sense.  The images were supplied by the listener, whose only qualification for participation was the possession of an &#34;imagination,&#34; a faculty that not only served to bring the spoken words to life but that became more practiced in such activity with each broadcast. &#34;Story-telling&#34; was, in many respects, more real, more captivating, more powerful than &#34;story showing.&#34;  If proof were needed, one had only to experience the anticlimax and disappointment of seeing the television &#34;Lone Ranger,&#34; who couldn't carry a single silver bullet compared to the endless supply being fired by the noble hero inspiring our imaginations as we listened in rapt attention to the radio version.    This long preamble is merely an introduction to one of the advantages of this little speaker, which I have finally &#34;taught&#34; to locate stations (using the app &#34;TuneIn&#34;) that carry old-time radio shows--the same as those of the 1940s but without static!  Moreover, the device is a great companion for my full-sized Echo, a Tower on a living-room coffee table, where it frankly is rarely called upon.  It does everything I've taught my Echo to do--except with less sonic sizzle.  But next to my bed, the Dot not only executes all of the functions of my two-year-old Echo but many I formerly had no use for--like telling it when to wake me up every morning or asking it what the forecast is for the week.    In &#34;short&#34; (which is what the Dot is compared to the Echo) the Dot is practically worth the asking price as a speaker (and I have yet to hear a $30 speaker that performs significantly better--no speaker this small is capable of capturing the frequencies of symphonic music, the overtones of the pianoforte, or the acoustic sounds of the double bass.)  But besides getting a decent small speaker, you're receiving a mini- &#34;computer&#34; that's a know-all / can-do-all verbal wizard.    I know that Google's answer to the Echo is said to have an algorithm capable of accessing more information.  But Amazon's Echo works just fine for me.  When I get serious about finding out about stuff, I prefer to read about it  (it's usually more efficient and faster than listening to someone tell me about, say, Turkish history).  The Dot is money well-spent, in my mind.  If $50 seems too much (currently it's $10 more than the Fire tablet that's become such a big hit with kids), you might save $10 if you wait for a Lightning Deal or can find a reconditioned model sold on Amazon.  Even as an alarm clock, the Dot is the perfect punctuation mark--whether as an addendum to the bigger Echo or as the autonomous little overachiever hiding in the corner of a desk or nightstand. ",
DesertWanderer,"October 30, 2016 ",1.0,"UPDATED: 2017-03-13    I now have 2 Echo dots.  Have had them both for quite some time now.  Basically they work just fine. Found out this morning that Alexa dosn't know what the Arizona timezone is.  Arizona doesn't do Daylight Saving time.  We are in MST 12 months of the year.  Yet, when picking a timezone the Arizona timezone is not an option.  You have to pick either Montain Stadard which is really now Mountain Daylight, or Pacific Standard which is now really Pacific Daylight.  There is no option to say that your timezone does not follow daylight saving.    So, unlike everything else we have, we need to change the Timezone on both Alexa devices when Daylight saving goes into effect and when it goes out of effect.  So, instead of saying MST, I need to pick PST otherwise the time on my Alexa's are off by an hour.    I've only had this for two days.  Never had another alexa unit before so this is a new experience.    Originally obtained to see how it worked and if it could be interfaced with other data and devices.  The developer program that Amazon has is interested and there are a number of other skills out there, but found it initially hard to discover (no search in the skills site, strange).    After a day, I ran into a problem, Red Ring where the Echo dot said it couldn't understand me now, try again later.  Support seemed to be missing as the app said it could load the help page and finding help on Amazon.  Trying to reset the device with the Alexa App is very hit or miss, the Echo Dot will say it is in setup mode and the app will just sit there and spin its icon forever if you let it.  The best fix seems to unplug the unit for a while and then plug it back in.    Pros  Small, contained speaker it comes with is adequate and voice range seems to be pretty good  The ring is a good indicator that it is hearing you.  Creating new skills looks to be straight forward but find what is available is limited with no searching for apps, poor rating abilities.  Setting up to use a skill seems fairly straight forward as well, but I found them via Google not the Echo Dot or the app.    Cons  Lack of access to lots of data...  This is where the difference between Googles Assistant and Echo Dot most likely will lie.  Huge amounts of info on Google is not available to the Echo dot as it is using inferior Bing and even Yelp for data neither of which are very impressive.  Apparently can fail and just stop recognizing me (red ring).  Not clear why.  Don't think it is the WiFi signal as I have a very strong router and everything works well with it.  Poor support - Searching for Alexa doesn't understand me red ring told me to use the app to teach the device, hard to do when it doesn't recognize me and says so right off the bat.    Right now, kinda mixed.  Was not very expensive and my goal is to interface it with other services (lots of ideas) and local hardware for possible in home automation.    Just for kicks, I added an external remote speaker and that worked well with the unit.  I suspect that any plugin speaker will work okay.    Will update as I get more used to it. ",
"Astrid Freja","April 19, 2017 ",5.0,"This was gifted to me at work. I got first place for a walk-a-thon that was being held. This came as a surprise to me.

Ensures I get up in time. This little device earned my 5 stars. ",
DAK,"November 11, 2016 ",3.0,"Bought three echo dots. They are all completely useless because the iOS app, the only way to set them up, simply does not work. I get a login, which I fill out and submit, and then all I see is the Amazon Alexa logo and a spinning activity indicator. Nothing else. No messages, errors, pictures, options. Nothing. Tried on my iPhone 7, iPad mini, and iPhone 5. Completely broken app across the board. Clearly not teated, polished, or well thought out. Thus I'm returning all three dots. Terrible effort, Amazon.    Update: after repeated attempts, even with a borrowed Android phone, I finally got it to work on by turning off WiFi on my iPhone 7. But the experience was pretty lousy. And now that it's working, I like the device itself okay, but the app is still terrible. When it works, it feels like a website from 2007 when companies were still trying to figure out how to make mobile-friendly sites. Anyone spoiled by Apple (or products from many other modern companies) will find the Alexa app laughable and barely usable. ",

STGuy,"April 1, 2017 ",3.0,"Siri sometimes annoys me and I don't care for needing an iPhone or iPad, or 'Hey, Siri...' to summon her. So I thought that getting a Dot and augmenting my meager home automation would be just the ticket.    So far I have been supremely disappointed. Setup was easy, but the Dot has failed to work so many times, and keeps reporting itself as disconnected when more often it's just actually confused and gives itself a break. I've relocated it to be within 2' of the router and it still says it's disconnected. When it does respond it usually won't do so for a subsequent command and takes another rest break, telling me to 'try again later'.    The app isn't well written and worse— it takes forever to respond (as did the Dot in Setup). It's often out of sync with what the Dot is doing, if and when it actually does something. Most of the time it responses with theb blue light for several seconds and then shuts off without an explanation.    Playing music is also frustrating. Occasionally it will play something from my Amazon online cache, more often it will play a different song of the same or similar name from Amazon Prime, most often it just stops. If told to play a genre such as jazz or 'relaxing' music (as mentioned by Amazon) it lights up, goes dark, and stays silent. If it does play some songs, it stops arbitrarily after a few minutes.    I was about to send it back (and there's STILL a lot of time) when some extensive surfing helped a little with some basic functionality. Amazon support hasn't been helpful AT ALL.    PROS  Easy to set up  Small footprint  Can use high-quality wired speakers as well as BT speakers (when convenience is more important that quality)  Hears you anywhere in the room  Potential for expansion of functionality    CONS  Poor and inconsistent performance  Requires very literal commands  Requires scouring the web to learn basic functionality    With over 24,000 mostly positive reviews [many of them fake on/two word 5-star reviews from people who give the same review for EVERY product they 'review'], no doubt some of this is likely my unfamiliarity with the learning curve. But given Amazon's definition of stars, I can't rate it higher at this point. For me, this is all uphill, and it's frustrating. That's without venturing into the whole third-party skills thing.    If I can grok the Dot— and I WANT to, the rating will improve, not that 1 in 24,000 means anything. But it shouldn't be this difficult to get good, consistent, reliable, BASIC results, let alone advanced Skills and IFTTT. Oy. How-to-Geek has been a big help. But somewhere there must be a fairly thorough tutorial on how to go from 0-60, 100, and infinity and beyond. Right now it's all I can do to not fire it against the wall. An intervention may be in order. ",

TheDad,"April 15, 2017 ",5.0,"This is a good product.  Alexa itself is lacking in a some MAJOR areas, like doing simple searches for information, but overall it's great for adding items to your calendar, controlling your Nest thermostat, and asking for Wikipedia info.  Also good for setting alarms and timers.  If they didn't use Bing, and would get around using Wikipedia for info, they'd have a winner.  If they don't, I think Google Home is going to destroy Amazon in the AI market.  For example, you can't ask, &#34;Alexa, how old was Andy Griffith when he died?&#34;  You'll get a response of, &#34;I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.&#34;  But if you ask, &#34;Alexa, Wikipedia Andy Griffith&#34; you'll get a brief paragraph about his career and life.  You still won't get the personal info you were looking for.  If you ask GOOGLE, &#34;Okay Google, how old was Andy Griffith when he died?&#34; you'll get an actual answer.  It's a HUGE difference in AI quality and capability and Amazon needs to get on the ball or they will LOSE. ",
"Charles Claros","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I received an Amazon Echo Dot 2nd generation refurbished for my birthday today! I've wanted one since they launched the product and my amazing partner bought me one. It came in just a few days ago, I opened the shipping box early since my name was on it, but she stopped me before I could open the little black box it came in. Today I receive it, and being the OCD tech junkie I am, followed all the steps on setting up the Dot to the 't'. It wouldn't go into the setup mode, and when I followed all the instructions on the Echo site and Amazon Product Support page, it still wouldn't work. I attempted the Reset of the device, but it was unresponsive. This shouldn't be right? It was certified refurbished by the warranty/tech department before it was allowed to be resold, right? Amazon wouldn't do this to their customers...RIGHT??? Unfortunately someone at the refurbishing sewer decided to just pass this one and let it be sold to make the company more money. I called Amazon support, she walked me through the same steps I did online, then transferred me to a &#34;tech support representative&#34;, I had thought I was already talking to one but apparently I wasn't. The next person walked me through THE EXACT SAMES STEPS I FOLLOWED FROM THE ONLINE SUPPORT PAGES AND THE LAST &#34;NON-TECH SUPPORT REPRESENTATIVE&#34; IN TECH SUPPORT. REALLY?!?!?!?! The third and last representative apologized and wanted me to send the device to the warranty department, he was going to email me an address label, NOT A SHIPPING LABEL (I HAVE TO APPARENTLY PAY FOR SHIPPING), to send this now TWICE defective device back to them so they can &#34;FIX&#34; it, or eventually send me a replacement refurbished device. I don't want another one of these. Not worth all this trouble. Why pay for a device that obviously has a reputation of not working. All theses 5 stars are those who purchased a new one and it worked day one. Instructions on set up suck, resetting sucks, tech support is God awful as they don't know what to really do other than the &#34;is the power on&#34; type of diagnostics and trying to solve the problem by replacing it with another defect that &#34;passed&#34; refurbishing standards.

You have to state all requirements in a single sentence, with the keyword at the beginning. This is far away from any natural voice command function.

Jennifer,"January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"Well let me start off by saying that I actually bought mine from my local BEST BUY because they were out of stock on amazon :( BUT this device is amazing it makes a lot of things so much easier now I'm currently in the process of turning my home into a &#34;smart home&#34; and so far everything has worked flawlessly I could not imagine going back to life with my Echo Dot it is just so convenient for so much! I highly highly recommend this to EVERYBODY!! 😃 ",
Ostego,"January 2, 2017 ",1.0,"Bought as a gift for my old man. While I'm usually at my computer for music and shopping needs, the old man has found this to be very useful for his &#34;lazy&#34; needs.

kelsey,"March 7, 2017 ",5.0,"I have two. One I have in the kitchen and use it to stream music, get the weather and listen to my audio book. I've also paired my smart lighting with my Echos so I can turn on the lights just by telling Alexa to do so! It's awesome! The other I have in the bedroom and use mainly as an alarm clock...I like that I don't have to move to snooze just all Alexa to snooze your alarm. Haha! ",

CookieMonster,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"The dot is almost ready to fulfil my smart home dream, an Alexa device in every room of the house. The price is right and it works brilliantly. There are some missing features from the Alexa family, like an intercom (saying, &#34;Alexa, broadcast lunch is ready to all from the kitchen&#34; or &#34;Alexa, tell workshop clean up and come in for dinner&#34;).  I got an iPhone and iPad and Siri is just about as useful as Alexa. Each has their own pluses and minuses.    The dot hears almost as good and speaker is similar to a jbl clip or other small Bluetooth speaker so it's good enough for background music or setting timers in the kitchen. I have an echo, 2 fire tvs and fire tv stick with Alexa, a tap and 3 second gen dots in my household. The tap is definitely the least useful device. It doesn't sound like much work to press the button to turn on the mic but I find I never have the tap in arms reach and walking over to touch the button is more work than walking over to look at a clock or my thermostat or turn on the light switch or whatnot. The tap was definitely a waste of money. Rant over. The dots are the cats meow though. Definitely worth trying for anyone. Affordable enough to eventually get one for ever room of the house. ",
"Kimberly Wynn","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"We were curious about these new connected &#34;assistants&#34;, and looked into google home and the Echo and Echo Dot. The low price on the dot enticed us to give it a try, and I am glad we did. There is a fairly wide variety of music and information that is accessible with just a prime account. It is quite handy to have Alexa play specific music, set an alarm, or check weather or news. We have not had luck with general knowledge questions, such as &#34;what is the current price of silver&#34; or &#34;who was Mussorgsky&#34;. She simply replies, &#34;I could not find the answer to your question&#34;. All in all I am glad we purchased it, we didn't realize that it had to be plugged in at all times, I somehow overlooked the fact that it doesn't have a battery, I assume the larger Echo does, but the Dot does not. Have been quite pleased with how responsive it is, almost always responds instantly whenever someone says &#34;Alexa&#34; anywhere in the room. We are a little bit weirded out by the thought that it is listening all the time, and if we start seeing ads for books about kids asking what is for dinner and where is my backpack we will know Amazon has infiltrated our family conversations with targeted ads. Just kidding, sort of. ",
"Betty C","January 29, 2017 ",5.0,"got one for the shower room... I can listen to whatever music I request!  Everyone likes singing in the shower.. now you can sing along!!

I'm getting another one for out on the patio!!  nicer sound than my other sources!!  I like this for the Music and information available!!! ",
"Amazon Customer","January 6, 2017 ",5.0,"I love my echo dot - it's a great price point, inexpensive enough that I don't feel guilty buying it.  I use it the most for time, timers, stopwatch, weather, shopping list, music and to find my phone.  I have also paired it with a TP Link so that i can turn my bedside table light on/off instead of getting out of bed and walking across the room when i'm ready to go to bed or need a light at night.    If it wouldn't be for the stupid skills that need to be enabled for every little thing, it would be 5 stars.  But who wants to find skills and then have to recall the name so that you can direct Alexa to use that skill.  Bad move Amazon.  If (when) google voice provides an entry price point for their Google Home line, the only advantage Alexa will have is ordering off Amazon. ",
"Michael J Cakora","March 28, 2017 ",5.0,"Fantastic device, purchased for wife who's technologically impaired. SHE LOVES IT. I set up a Pandora account for her on her laptop and phone, and then linked it via Bluetooth to our Vizio S2121 speaker bar. She gets the weather, switches from classical music to Carolina Beach music to a radio station to whatever in a snap. Very user friendly. While the music is playing she’ll ask who the composer or artist performing is and the answer comes instantly.    To play the music through the Vizio bar, all she has to do is start the music via Alexa (“Alexa, play classical), then power on the bar and hit the bar’s Bluetooth button, then tell Alexa to use the speaker. Simple, just great for someone transitioning from the 20th to the 21st century. When she stops the music, the sound bar reverts to the TV from Bluetooth, so it’s painless for her.    The only disappointment is that the Echo Dot does not support the Sirius XM channels. My wife has the online subscription and can play it on her phone or laptop, but can’t yet access the programs via Echo Dot.    I recommend this over the Echo because of the 3.5 mm plug and Bluetooth if you have a sound bar, headset, or equivalent to use within typical Bluetooth ranges. ",
bladerunner619,"March 27, 2017 ",3.0,"for the price you cant beat it. Kudos to Amazon for making stuff affordable. Yes you could spend hundreds or thousands for home automation, but you cant beat the price on this. We dumped cable tv years ago for amazon fire, i can get weather traffic and news with my coffee in the morning by asking. I get that skills are limited as there is no real motive for programers, skills are free. But i am patient and amazon dedicated so we'll see. I did buy it with rewards points so it was free.  as far as appearance- perfect, set up- my grandma could do it, its that easy, You definately want a ext. speaker if youre using it in more than a small room but 27$ will get a good quality speaker suitable for average user. Distance- it picks up my voice from 2 rooms away without really yelling.  cons/wishes- i wish you could choose your own name for it, that is a security issue as recently happened here, when tv reporters said Alexa ordered a doll house, and everyone with a dot within range of the tv had doll houses ordered. Or if they would just have a 4 digi pin number you can set to confirm voice orders.  Remember its not Siri, it takes a little getting used to what it can do, but as usual, for the price amazon has not let me down ",
Subash,"January 3, 2017 ",5.0,"I was very skpetical to try Echo for a while. Made up my mind this thanks giving and bought it along with Belkin switches to get started with the smart home.    Alexa is definitely not a matured voice recognition technology. However it impressed me by being better than I had expected it to be (After my failed attemps with both Google and Cortana) I love the fact that I can do some tiny tasks now sitting on my couch :) I also like the fact that I dont have to take out my phone to play the tracks/albums from Spotify/Pandora and cast it to chromecast devices. The speaker on Alexa is loud enough for me to play music in the background. Bluetooth connection to my home theater is very stable(repeated connect/disconnects) I get snippets of tech happenings and my calender everyday morning. Saves my eyes and finger from interacting with mobile. Also its natures gift that hearing is so much less energy intensive compared to reading (makes sense why schools are still needed to learn)    I hope Amazon is seriously pushing this technology for betterment. I see huge potential. It is not smart today, but can become and converse naturally with the users. I would love to have an assistant who can deal with many things I want to offload on day to day basis. ",
"Phillip O.","February 7, 2017 ",5.0,"I returned my large Echo and purchased the Dot other than the speakers it works the same.  But the Echo's have their problems.  Greatly lacking in the information department.

"Jeff Kimes","December 7, 2016 ",4.0,"Alright folks. Here is what I wanted to know before I made the mistake of buying the Google Home. First off,  I tried that...  Needless to say it had terrible microphone pickup and was a bear to configure using IFTT. Consistency was an issue with all commands.  On to the Echo Dot. This device absolutely does everything that the Alexa would do. All you are missing is the big speaker. You can connect this to a Bluetooth speaker and get the great sound that you're looking for. However it also has a good speaker that is decent as well. Its function is wonderful! It has not missed a single command in the past week, and assigning skills is a breeze! It recognizes Who You Are and allows you to order from Amazon as well! I've actually bought three of these now for multiple locations in the house. The interface through the app is very easy to use and it helps you remember what you've asked it before in the past. Set up was also very quick and easy, there were simple instructions and Alexa was quick to recognize both my network and also my smart devices in the house. You should not hesitate a second in investing in this device. The Price is Right, and it is only going to get better as more skills and product integration are created. ",
Ron,"April 23, 2017 ",3.0,"So, I'm a sceptic when it comes to items that claim they do great things with very little money.  This $49 Dot is AMAZING!  How? What? Is this magic?  I've had it 2 weeks now and it keeps getting better!  I grew up on Apple product using them since the 1980's.  I must say, Apple claims to the the leader with Siri, but Siri has NOTHING on Alexa! This Dot just works that well!    I have it hooked up to my hi-fi stereo system that I leave on all the time. I walk into my house, and it hears me from different rooms!  I just say &#34;Echo, play music&#34;..and music starts to play! (Note: you can name it Alexa, Echo or Amazon, I have mine named Echo). Then if you buy the $3.99/month music service it will play virtually any album know to man. Example... &#34;Echo play Pink Floyd's The Final Cut&#34;...  The album starts playing.  &#34;Echo, next track&#34; and it goes to the next track on the album. &#34;Echo, volume to 10&#34; and it turns the volume up.    Then, I bought optional wifi outlets. A 2-pack for $50. They work insanely well with the Dot.  &#34;Echo, turn on lights&#34;... All lights turn on.  &#34;Echo, turn off bedroom light&#34;... and just the bedroom turns off.    You just have to get one. At $49, just think of it as taking a class on knowledge of living in the future! ",

Danno-da-Manno,"March 9, 2017 ",4.0,"* * * Absolutely one of the very worst products I've EVER purchased * * *    &#62;&#62;&#62;And it's very important to note in light of my comment above&#60;&#60;&#60;  ... that I am a lifelong 'Amazon Guy' ... Diehard / All Things Amazon and Amazon Prime kinda guy!!! It is exclusively for this reason that I have not only once, not just twice, but actually even a third time:    -Purchased an Echo ..... (One full size at first, then two of the Dots on the second and third attempts)    -Tried it and tried it, over and over again each time, yet with severe failure each time around to ultimately experience any sense of even the most marginal and/or somewhat reasonable degree of correct functionality or purpose or usefulness    *Primarily due to complete lack of voice-recognition and/or functionality*    (---And I am notoriously recognized as a very clearly-enunciated, well-spoken orator)    -But each time then being forced to once again return each of them    *At least the first two. The third is currently being boxed-up for shipment to our friends home in another state, whom for whatever reason actually do enjoy theirs    This has, (in my humble opinion), been an extreme showing of devotion to the brand, with a blind hope toward the possibility of any progressively worthwhile increases in functionality along the way with each subsequent purchase.    Ultimately, in the end, it must be stated that I ABSOLUTELY WOULD *NOT* RECOMMEND this to even my worst enemy. So much so, that if there was a no Stars option, I would have absolutely opted for that in order to feel more correct and accurate about this rating/review  (Sorry Amazon.

PB,"March 2, 2017 ",4.0,"I'm very disappointed with this product.  Three times this morning she turned on without my talking to her.  The first was as I was waking up.  I know it was perfectly quiet in my bedroom but she started telling me what a word score is.  What?  (I only have one unit so it wasn't interference from elsewhere and the rest of the house was quiet.).  Then in the next 1/2 hour she twice spoke up saying she didn't know how to help me with that.  I hadn't asked her for anything.  I had the radio on (not through the echo dot) during these second two incidents but she should be able to handle that.  My recommendation is to wait until this technology is much more refined.  She can't really do that much now and these outburst from her are really annoying.  I unplugged her after these incidents and plan to try to get a refund (I'm 3 weeks outside the return window though) or I will throw her away. ",

Justin,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Alexa is pretty cool. I bought the dot mainly to I could control my smart home enabled lights with my voice. The dot responds well most times but many times does not understand and even sometimes just ignores me! I read lots of reviews of how Alexa can hear you well even while other sound is in the back ground but after using it for a few weeks now I would say it's about a 50/50 shot if the dot will hear you over the TV or dogs playing. I find myself literally yelling orders at it sometimes and other times having to pull my phone out and just use my app which is what the dot was suppose to alleviate.  As for sound quality, it really impressed me actually. I thought since it was so much less expensive than the echo that the speaker would be pretty bad but I've listened to music on it while doing homework and it's not bad. It's not going to blast your music well during a party but for simple listening it's fine.  3 stars for now until it can hear under more conditions and understand me more often ",
Lawrence,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"It's not quite there yet. It will control your smart home devices and answer very very simple questions.

Also, it doesn't understand the groups that are linked to my Phillips Hue light, only the individual light names which is weird, I'm pretty sure I have it set up right too. So that's kinda annoying that I have to say each individual light on in a room to turn them on, a bit disappointing there too.

"J. D. Rotz","March 4, 2017 ",4.0,"For $50, this is a good deal - I saw it before for $35, which would have been a steal.  If you've read about how much fun and useful the Dot (or any Alexa-based product) can be, you won't be disappointed.    Be aware that the speaker on the Dot isn't very powerful, and if you use it to stream to a remote stereo system like I am, it will take some balancing to get the volumes right - when you disconnect bluetooth from the stereo, the Dot volume can be very low, and if you turn up the Dot volume and then reconnect, you'll get blown out of the room.    I've set it up in the garage to stream music via bluetooth to an old stereo system.  It's great to be able to control things with voice commands, instead of doing it manually with dirty, greasy hands.  Also, the different things Alexa can do make it so much better than just hooking up a radio, or tape player, or some other peripheral device - adding things to your To-Do or Shopping lists is pretty cool when you're working on a project and don't have  a pencil and paper handy.  For $70 (Dot + Bluetooth receiver) and an old stereo that was sitting in the storeroom doing nothing, this setup is cheap and works much better than I thought it would. ",

Victoria,"March 30, 2017 ",5.0,"The echo dot has changed my life! Our home will never be the same. I purchased 2 echo dots, placing them on each floor so everyone in the family can have access wherever they are in our home. My daughter listens to her pop music upstairs, while I listen to either my Kindle or audible books downstairs. Turning on/off the lights, changing the thermostat temperature while my hands are full when cooking dinner in the kitchen is so helpful, I'm still recovering from that moment of happiness. ",
AMCHIKER,"December 17, 2016 ",5.0,"No doubt you can probably do everything the Echo does does in another way, such as checking the internet with your phone or pc, listen to music in a similar fashion.  That being said, the Echo really makes it all simple.  The voice recognition is amazing and has worked for everyone in our circle of friends.  The only time it has trouble is when multiple people are speaking.  It was a breeze to connect up and start using.  At this rate, once Amazon figures out the delivery to packages via drones, I may never have to get up off the sofa again.    The only thing that irked me was it went on sale for $10 off the regular price the week after I bought it. ",
"Andrew Hollingsworth","April 19, 2017 ",5.0,"Great concept, poorly executed. It's better as a novelty item than something that makes home life easier.  Design wise it's the best looking device of this type on the market, compact which makes it great for small spaces and appealing color pallets. Unfortunately looks aren't all that matters.    I have experienced many issues with invoking 'skills'. I routinely have a skill enabled, like Vivint smart home complete and when I try to call upon it Alexa tells me that it's not enabled. She then tells me the command to enable it, which I do, then she tells me the skill is already enabled. This happens quite often I find with different 'skills'. Sometimes Alexa totally misunderstands you. Example I enabled a skill called 'Chineasy'. I asked Alexa to ask Chineasy for today's lesson, but this is what she heard 'Actually secret today's lesson'.    Also for me, the way you invoke these 'skills' is clumsy. You have to ask alexa to ask the skill to 'do something'. It's similar to when you're a kid and you're mad at a friend but need to ask them something, but instead of asking them yourself, you turn to a neutral party and ask them to ask your friend because you're not talking to them.

Carbonhead,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Fast, easy setup. Fairly easy to use. Adding skills to it almost daily. Our favorites are music, news, weather and jokes. We also have an elderly family member and we in stalled the buddy app to allow Alexa to text us in the event of an emergency. A nice extra emergency layer. We are amazed how well it hears from another rm. Even whispering its name works! Very sensitive micriphones. For the price, $39 on sale, it just cant be beat! Wifes not a tech person but she even warmed up to it once she saw how easy it is to use. Not sure what else we want it to do, but its nice to know that you can easily make it smarter or dumber, depending on what you want. Comes preinstalled with several useful apps/skills already, and those will easily get you started. We have it hooked to a nice boom box with killer speakers and a sub, so the music rocks, but the internal speaker is more than adequate for most tasks. If you use the external mini stereo jack, it is stereo, not mono. It easily paired with my UE Boom Bluetooth speakers, but as stated in the instructions, only 1 item at a time. So no stereo that way since my Booms sync differently, thats not the dots problem, just my speakers. For their entry Alexa unit, you cant go wrong. And no monthly fees! ",
"Stephen Osborne","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I had this device for three months, which I used the device daily and loved it, but after the third month the device would go in and out, restarting for no apparent reason. I tried restarting my modem and router, i tried different outlets, i tried restarting the device. Nothing worked. If I get a replacement and have no problems maybe I'll see this as just a fluke, but for now I'll give it two stars for faulty hardware. ",
"Ryan K.","November 30, 2016 ",5.0,"The Echo Dot works great for large and small rooms.  I picked this up to use in our living room, dining room and kitchen.  I did not need the larger Echo as I have a receive with Bluetooth that Echo connected to without a problem.  The far field microphones work very well in when giving commands to Alexa.  The Echo Dot would work very well in a small area as a stand alone device with out the need for external speakers. ",
Lee,"February 18, 2017 ",2.0,"I purchased this to place in the master bedroom. I have had a few issues with the dot. It does not always pick up my voice and I have to say Alexia two or three times before it responds. Second issue is the speaker is horrible when listening to music. I'm moving my original Echo back into the bedroom which could pick up my voice from anywhere in the room and has a much better speaker. Not impressed with the dot but love my Echo ",
Rita,"March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"We call her &#34;Dot&#34; when we don't want her to respond. And sometimes I have to turn off her microphone because she tries to help the Echo on TV commercials. I've used Dot for awhile now and she's ok. She runs 2 WeMo smart switches in my house and answers easy questions. I definitely appreciate the shopping and to do lists. Her skills apps are cute, but weather and news are what I'm most interested in. Setup was pretty easy, though at first it appeared she wasn't going to set up, but really was. I gave Dot 5 stars because I think she has great potential especially in the smart house area. I am seriously considering getting another one for my bedroom. ",
AshGray,"December 15, 2016 ",2.0,"I got the Alexa for Christmas and love it so I bought myself a Dot to keep in my bedroom. No problems, I hooked it up to a bluetooth speaker system that is part of my soundbar with my Smart TV in the bedroom and it sounds great! I do recommend adding external speakers if you do not plan on moving the Dot from place to place. If you have 2 units like I do, the main Alexa downstairs in the living room and the Dot in my bedroom, please make sure you change the name of the Dot so they do not access at the same time. There are 7 microphones in the Alexa and it picks up my voice from upstairs, that is how powerful this is. The Dot is the same way. My Alexa is &#34;Alexa&#34; and the Dot is &#34;Echo&#34; as per suggestions on the Alexa app on my iPhone, iPad, and MAC laptop. These are great and I do not have to get up and change radio or TV channels, just command them to do so. I do recommend buying the voice remote as well for extra convenience in case you are in a noisy environment so that Alexa or Dot can pick up your commands. I am very pleased with this. I also have an Amazon Fire HD 6 tablet with the Alexa apps on it. Great to carry around with me from room to room instead of my big iPad. ",
"cecil taylor","January 8, 2017 ",5.0,"Bought 6 for gifts and to add to my echo in the living room. The dot is is edition for ambiance while sleeping and provides constant music of your choice. I added the library of music for 3.95 a month for unlimited choices in music and albums not provided on a standard prime membership. I also add a Bluetooth speaker (BOHO)  for remote sound, the dot is connected to AC. A bargain if the cost of the echo is of concern. ",
"Toni Brown","January 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I really wanted to like this and have given it a good time to give it a chance, but it's just frustrating.  I have the full Echo in my living room and I love it.  However, this little one doesn't even compare in terms of response.  I have to ask it two or three times before I can get any response from it.  I can see the blue light twirling, and then nothing.  Last night I asked it to turn off the lights that I use when navigating to my bedroom at night.  At first I thought I was going to have to ask again, but the blue light was still on.  Finally, the lights went out, but no 'OK' response.  It took her several more seconds for that to happen.  It's especially annoying for her lag in the mornings to turn on the 'Morning' lights.  You know, before I've had my coffee.  I wanted one in my bedroom because as a single woman I like the thought of being able to say ;&#34;Alexa, turn on the outside lights' should I hear any noises.  I don't feel secure with this thing at all.  I'm not sure if I just happen to get a bad one or what since other people are rating it so high.  I had high hopes for it and planned on ordering more for other rooms, but not taking that chance in case I get another dud. ",
"S. Lee","April 24, 2017 ",5.0,"Like what many people have commented on.  This is much smaller than what you would expect from the images online (which is a good thing in my opinion).  Had it unpacked and set up in about 3 minutes.  The app was easy to install and worked pretty much right out of the box.  The voice recognition is the best I have ever dealt with.  The Echo Dot easily understood my voice as well as my wife's.  She was not born here in the US and has a slight accent that was no problem at all.  She was pleasantly surprised.  For it's size, the built in speaker actually did a decent job.  Asking for weather reports or news was extremely clear.  I had this unit set up in my computer room and was able to give commands from the next room, with the door closed!  That was surprising.  I have to admit, I had to raise my voice a bit though. I also have an alarm panel that I needed to download a skill to be compatible with the Echo Dot and it works great.  I have already purchased some z-wave bulbs to add on to my system to enable further automation. I can that there is so much potential to link with other products.  I have to say, there is really something fun about have voice control over your lights and Z-wave products.  It reminds me how much it feels like I'm in a episode of Star Trek TNG. ",
"Andy Mikloiche","January 29, 2017 ",2.0,"Bought this for my wife to use primarily as an alarm clock she has a hard time setting her digital 2 alarm settings bedside clock. The Echo Dot is the easiest way possible for her to get a wake  up call. She lets Alkexa know what time she would like to wake up and Alexa delivers every time, on time. ",
samantha,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought this for my daughter's bday and after reading the info on it and figuring out all of the additional functions etc It's a pretty cool little device and I really think she will be pleased!  I originally ordered this in black but it was damaged in shipping and delivery was cancelled.  CS was superb at helping me to quickly replace it although the black was unavailable the white would suffice.  I'll have to order a skin for it as my other daughter is receiving one in white as well.  I wanted a distinguishable difference in their gifts because they are kids and fight over everything lol.  But it's a minor consequence.  I'm sure they'll adore using these the only true unfortunate downside is the ever growing additional costs of usage.  The plug adapters and special light bulbs run about $60 for the kit to have dot turn lights or devices connected to this adapter outlets on and off or dim the lights, etc.  Also I have to connect it to accounts etc...I'm sure after the initial hassle of set up it'll be well worth it as are all things worth having!  Oh added bonus...you can change the WAKE WORD...because I despise the name ALEXA (sorry)  There are options of calling it ECHO & I believe another choice or 2. ",
Rottlover,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I adore my dot! I have the full sized echo in the living room and got this one for my bedroom. Though the speaker leaves something to be desired, I had a Bluetooth speaker lying around, and the dot stays connected very well. The external speaker makes the sound much better, so playing music and audio books is more enjoyable. Also love that it comes in white. There seem to be new features added all the time. A steal for even the regular price of $50ish. ",
"J. W,","December 8, 2016 ",3.0,"I purchased this for my husband as I was tired of him asking me simple questions like, what's the weather going to be today, or what time does that football game start, etc. etc.  As if I always know these things off the top of my head!  Turns out that I'm actually now using it more than he is!  I have it in the kitchen where I tend to spend most of my free time cooking and baking.  It's a spectacular tool for when I need to be reminded of things like how many ounces are in a quart, what kind of substitution can I use, or when I need a timer set when my hands are full of dough!  Super easy to set up and operate.  I would highly recommend this to anyone! ",
"Ralph T. Katt","December 30, 2016 ",5.0,"You have to love Alexa, unless you happen to watch an episode of &#34;Life&#34; (a series about a cop wrongly convicted of murder) which happens to have an episode with a character named, you guessed it, Alexa.  The Amazon Dot will respond to the name Alexa and similar names when you are watching TV.  Otherwise, I love &#34;her&#34; as she will answer your questions, sing you a song, tell you a joke, and stream music. ",
"Tim Consolazio","January 2, 2017 ",5.0,"The device gets five stars primarily for the value. For $50 it's a really great deal, kind of unbelievable. The device generally works as advertised too...sometimes you have to repeat yourself and for the vast majority of &#34;skills&#34; are useless, but overall it's more practical than you'd think. I use it all the time to turn on/off the living room lights (using the Kasa plug), set timers and alarms, and ask the time and weather. On average I probably use the device ten or so times a day minimum. Asking it jokes is also fun, and of course there's BOX OF CATS!!!    Music also sounds half way decent straight out of the device, and since you can hook it up to bluetooth speakers, you can get a pretty compelling experience (though it can be alarming to hear Alexa booming out of your stereo speakers). Being able to request songs from Amazon or Spotify is very futuristic, think requesting &#34;spanish guitar music&#34; from The Computer on Enterprise.    And, it's a great gift, even for the non-gadget inclined.    Yeah Amazon got this one right. Sure there's some things they could do a little differently, and they probably will, but for $50 it's not painful to be an early adopter here. ",
LDKennedy,"April 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I decided to try out a Dot first (setting that up in my bedroom) to see if I'd really use it, and I'm definitely hooked.  Love being able to use it with the smart lights I purchased, and for little things like asking what time it is (without having to roll over to see the clock) and checking the weather.  The sound quality of this little one is better than I expected, but I do like being able to hook it to an external speaker for better quality for music -- and have now paired it with an Amazon Tap, which presents all kinds of possibilities. Have also added an Amazon Echo for my living room, but am just as happy with my original &#34;test&#34; purchase. ",
"Doctor Mo","December 6, 2016 ",5.0,"Love that it's small compared to our normal sized Echo, but boy is it quiet. We have to set the volume to 7-8 for normal listening, which would be very loud on the normal Echo. It also doesn't seem to hear as well when it's already playing something; I feel like I have to shout at it. Might be because it's short and not getting a direct line of sight (hearing?) to my voice. This isn't an issue with the normal Echo -- that one hears amazingly well even when cranked up. Oh, and on that note, the Echo Dot doesn't have a ring you can turn to adjust volume, which I sometimes miss when I'm sitting right next to it. You have to ask her, which interrupts the program.    It's fine for bedside, as a suplimental instance of Alexa in the house, which is where we use it, and also to control home automation outlets in our room. I think best music usage would be to hook it up via Bluetooth to a speaker, which the normal Echo can't do.    I would dissuade someone from buying this as a primary, first experience with the Echo. Splurge for the real thing to see what Alexa can do, then buy this little guy (lady?) for all those times you wish you could ask for the weather upstairs. ",

Plays music via my stereo system (Bluetooth) so I didn't feel the need to buy the full Echo which, as far as I understand, is the same brain with an expensive speaker under it.  Definitely needs more skills and to work on natural language processing.  Also, we would love to have more names to choose from - you can pick  Alexa, Echo, or Amazon  but that is it. ",
"Amber Campbell","February 26, 2017 ",4.0,"This little tool is the best. I purchased on several months ago and it is a household favorite. I use it daily to update my shopping list, listen to music, set timers (I wear hearing aids and don't hear the microwaver timer but Alexa comes through loud and clear!) and check the news and weather. My kids love it to check homework (Alexa is GREAT at math!), and play games such as 20 questions.  It is small and non-intrusive with your home decor.  This purchase is for a Christmas gift - my father quizzes Alexa whenever he is at my house, so this is for him.  I highly recommend Alexa- specifically this small Echo Dot - and a small bluetooth speaker to use it with. ",
Jerri,"December 17, 2016 ",4.0,"We have 2 original DOTs, 3 Echos, 1 Tap and now 6 2nd Generation Dots (order 6 get 1 free).  The 2nd Gen Dots are just as good as the original version and now come in white too (better for my decor).  I have set up 2 of the 2nd Gen Dots and am very pleased.  One will be used tonight to stream spooky Halloween music to a bluetooth speaker for all of the little trick or treaters.  Just like all of these devices, they are super simple to set up.  Bluetooth works great.  I have no issue with any of my devices hearing me.  On occasion I have to repeat a request, but most of the time I am heard the first time around - even with loud streaming music playing on bluetooth speakers.  I have found that if I need to repeat &#34;Alexa&#34; that screaming Alexa (or whatever wake word one uses) does not produce good results.  I always try to calmly speak &#34;Alexa&#34; in my normal voice.  I have set up TP-Link smart hubs to control my lights and they work slick with my DOTs and other devices. We use all of these devices for a lot of things - controlling lights, streaming music, setting timers, weather, alarms, listening to the news, asking questions, ordering things from Amazon, etc. While not perfect, they just keep getting better and better.  They are a lot of fun too.  Highly recommend. ",
"R C","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Very happy I purchased it. I thought since I already had 2 Fire Sticks with voice control that the Echo would be redundant however this is always on and ready to answer your questions without having to turn on TV. Just ask Alexa anything and you get a quick response from anywhere in the room.  Mine is located in family room and she can hear you from 20 plus feet away without having to shout. She comes in handy for spelling, definitions  current events etc. Truly remarkable. She also connects to your Music Library and plays your requests. I currently use it without an external speaker  and you can still get amazing sound from this hockey puck size unit. Really love it. ",

The first time I heard about this, it peaked my interest. This Amazon Echo Dot is an amazing piece of technology.  However, I am a little concerned that this little,round object is so much smarter than me.  And, it's not even a contest:)  If you don't have one, get one.  It is simply too cost effective to pass up if you are &#34;into&#34; anything like this.  It has tremendous capability.  As a matter of fact, I am very much looking forward to learning additional skills that are available.  For now, responses to math, spelling, general questions is working for me.  By the way, the music is unbelievable.  Do you want a specific song? Do you want a type of music?  Do you want music of a particular artist?  You can pretty much get whatever you want with a simple request.  In order to not mislead you, I am signed up with a music provider that channels the songs to &#34;Alexa&#34;.  By the way, the speaker is better than I expected considering the size.  As the saying goes,&#34; big things come in small packages&#34;.  That is the ECHO DOT!! ",

"J. Cleary","April 23, 2017 ",5.0,"I received two dots as part of my initiation into automating some aspects of my home. I have these paired up with a Samsung SmartThings Hub, so my review is geared towards that experience. The SmartThings is the brains behind the operation, and the Echo Dots provide voice control for those brains.    The Echo Dots were very easy to setup, took less than 5 minutes before I was giving commands to Alexa and having them filter through to the SmartThings Hub. I am amazed at how fast Alexa responds to some queries - though some others take slightly longer if she has to track down an answer to a more obscure question/request.    I don't know how often the firmware gets updated for these and how often her database of responses, features, skills, etc. gets updated, but I look forward to watching this product grow.    The Dot is great if you have no desire to listen to music through it - but if you do I know there are a lot of decent Bluetooth speakers you can use. I have a large entertainment system, so I'll probably get another one of these to hook up to that and perhaps in the future it will support other ways to control home entertainment systems without having to invest in a Harmony Hub.

"Brian Stephens","January 6, 2017 ",3.0,"The Echo Dot is a great tool, but does not come without its drawbacks. It is great for playing music (plus you can get amazon unlimited on the echo dot for like $3 or $4 a month), giving news updates, adding events to your calendar, while cooking (timer), setting alarms and so forth. I do not use it to its full capability ( I do not have any smart home devices) which limits its effectiveness. The speaker on the device is much better than I expected, but I still use a Bluetooth speaker to make it even better). The sound recognition is amazing as it can capture my 'Alexa' command even in another room. I love getting quick updates in the morning as I make breakfast. The biggest frustration I have with my dot is that it needs to be plugged in at all times. If you have only one device it is effective only when you are relatively close. I got my echo dot on sale and have no regrets about my purchase (especially at a reduced price). I do not have a standard Echo, but in my estimation this is a much better deal (especially with the very easy Bluetooth connection). You can easily buy a nice Bluetooth speaker and the dot and still save money in comparison to a traditional Echo. ",
"LR Wells","November 30, 2016 ",5.0,"I had already bought a Tap.  I love the tap because it is portable and there is phenomenal sound, for the size.  It does not, however respond to voice commands.  So, unless you're near it, it is useless from a distance.    That is where the Dot comes in.  I bought a few for Christmas gifts.  My sister used hers, immediately.  I loved the responsiveness, even from a distance.  I decided to get one for myself.    One of the places I used my Tap was the bathroom.  The Dot became the replacement.  I can speak to it, from my bedroom and have it start playing even before entering the bathroom.  I can't believe how sensitive the microphone is from a distance or even while playing music.  The sound quality isn't as good as the Tap, but it is good enough for the small space.  I can utilize the natural acoustics of the bathroom to make it sound a little better.  I love that I can stop the music playing for news, weather updates, etc.    I think I'm going to hook it up to some bigger speakers, for better sound.  I can turn an older stereo system into a modern streaming device.    If they sold these in packs, it would be even better.  I'd like to have one in each bedroom, so that where I am, I can have access to music and updates. ",

Langevinrox,"January 15, 2017 ",4.0,"Not too shabby. Currently this item is $39, which is great for the price point. It acts as a home hub and completes several other functions. I mostly enjoy asking about the weather locally and places I plan to visit. I enjoy having music just a few words away. I like the bed time stories and the flash briefing. I'm going to use the weather, traffic and local news every day before I go to work. I also like checking on my favorite football team. My only complaint is that it uses the Bing search engine which is really sub-par. There are several simple questions that it just seemingly can't find an answer to. There could be a bit more ... common sense. When I want iHeartRadio to play, I go through 3 phrases, all with the same meaning but worded differently before getting to actually work and I can't voice control iHeartRadio except to get it to resume, which is still good, it'd just be nice to be able to use voice to change stations .I hope to add some lights and other stuff.

There is a quick & dirty way to get it operational, more quickly: 1. Press the 'talk' button (so saying 'Alexa' is, unnecessary; 2. Say, 'Pause' & release the button, then press it, again, & say, &#34;Resume.&#34; The technical people are 'looking into, it' but no dice, so far.  Extensive testing has revealed only, this, so far, but there are things which are unused & untested, since they are unnecessary, for me.    Now that I have the unpleasantness, out of the way...    This little gem is terrific in so many, ways...  -Turns on/off lights, using smart switches  -Finds information, quickly,  -Plays music from either Prime Music or Unlimited (for a nominal, additional, fee)  ...and so much, more. It was fairly easy to set up, even though the instructions leave a bit to be desired. There is help, via a good, search engine.

Lynn,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Love it. My two favorite things to do with the echo dot are, using it as a alarm clock and shopping list.  The best thing about shopping list is that I can be in town shopping and if my husband who is home thinks of something else we need all he has to do is add to shopping list and it will immediately show up on my phone's shopping list (you can also do the same with &#34;to do list&#34;).  Alarm, I have been using my cell phone as a alarm for years, mainly because I hate getting up to turn off the alarm. I don't even have to roll over to turn off Alexa. I just say &#34; Alexa stop&#34;, but be warned it's so easy to fall back to sleep. I usually ask Alexa to set timer for 10 minutes if I have someplace to be that morning.  One last thing. My grandchildren (ages 4,3,2 & 1) enjoying having Alexa play there favorite Disney theme songs. Even the 1yr old managed to say Alexa, (she would respond) but couldn't say lollipop (his favorite song) well enough for her to understand and play. Didn't stop him from trying. If you have small children I would suggest disabling voice purchasing.    As soon as they are back in stock, I plan on purchasing more. ",
Jojoro,"November 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I don't have a smart home so I don't really get to enjoy all the features this device can offer, but I am enjoying it just the same. As a Prime user I can access all my Amazon music. I have it connected to an Oontz in my kitchen and it works flawlessly accessing music. I used it too access an Audible Book and it immediately started reading from where I left off. I tried to get it to find some recipes but was told by Alexa that it didn't have many recipes yet. I take that as a feature that will be exploited in the future. The mic is very sensitive. I was watching Cnet on You Tube and it it kept hearing the commands and following live right along including placing a book order on Prime Amazon. Luckily, I was asked if I wanted to complete the order and I just said &#34;no&#34;. to end the transaction. I have only begun to use the Dot (1 day) and haven't tested or used most what it offers, but I was impressed how easily the set up was. Out of box and running in 5 minutes. I do like how easy it is to switch my listening preferences by just voice command. Sometimes, simple is nice. And I have experienced no drop from WiFi while using this. I do get that issue when I have Apple Music playing from the other room at times, but it hasn't happened as of yet with the Dot. ",
Myrnster,"February 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I love my Alexa and I love my new Echo Dot!  It really does make your life easier.  I have my Dot paired with a Bose Speaker and love the fact that I can just tell it to start playing music from any of my Music accounts.  Pandora, Amazon Prime, Spotify . . she gets it right!  After decorating my Christmas Tree this year, I sat down on the couch and said, &#34;Alexa, can I order a clapper?&#34;  After informing me of the price, I said yes, and two days later I controlled my Christmas Tree lights from the comfort of my couch.  Thank you Alexa!  Wish I would have bought more when the Cyber Monday price was around $33.00.  It would make an excellent gift. ",
"SW Engineer","October 31, 2016 ",5.0,"Great little product.  I love that Amazon is constantly expanding capability.  Keep it up.  Just be aware though, people, that the commercials are a little misleading.  In order to control your house you're going to need all of the &#34;smart&#34; devices and controllers.  Out of the box, it won't be much more than a toy.  But hey, for $40 it was even worth it for a toy.  In fact, I'm putting 2 of these in my kids' stockings for Christmas along with their own Hue bulb. If you have a decent AVR or even a Bluetooth speaker then you don't need the big Echo.  The little dot has all the same capability except for the big speaker.  I do have a Christmas wish for Amazon though:    Please please please add the capability for the mobile app to give commands to your Alexa if you're on the same Wifi network.  PLEASE!  I'll even volunteer to write the software for you.  It can't be that difficult!  That simple addition would make this little guy extremely powerful.  I know you want little dots in every room but there are people out there avoiding this thing because they can't control it with their phone.  The app is quite useful as it is, yes... but it could be so much more. ",
ProjectSpawn,"December 7, 2016 ",5.0,"I never knew i needed this in my life!! When the first alexa product came out (The big tall one) i was looking at it and i was like &#34;man, 150$ is WAY to much for somthing i might not use all that often&#34;.After they released the echo dot and it was 50$ it peaked my interest, then for cyber monday it got lowered to 40$ and I  was like &#34;it's too good i can't pass this up&#34; and let me tell ya i love everything this little hockey puck can do, from answer my random questions to, tell me a joke to even control my music when i'm laying in bed. I've always been a conspiracy theorist about a lot of things and was worried about letting something like thio into my home where someone could be listening in on me, but i understand a lot of it's voice saved cloud storage is to make it better (even if, there are other ways they could listen in ((facebook or anything else)).    This thing straight out of the box was VERY easy to set up and get connected, took me about 10 min. to get it up and running. I love the fact that they also have voice training so if i pronounce something different than others, it will understand me. I hope they never quit adding updates, i LOVE THIS THING!!! ",
Nitedawg,"December 11, 2016 ",5.0,"Oh my God!!!  This is so cool.  Highly recommend.  Plays music beautifully -- easy to command.  I have now taken a 30 day trial subscription (for $3.99/mo after trial) to Amazon's Music Unlimited - plays everything I ask for -- I love it and will probably continue.  Also, bought a TP-LINK mini plug- in adapter to try with a lamp.  Easy to set up also - it's coupled with the DOT and Alexa commands work perfectly. ",
"George Vandervort","December 2, 2016 ",5.0,"Packaged well, Easy to open package and Easy to setup and charge up and it worked very well.. I may even order a second Echo Dot 2 for elsewhere in my House, they must be placed at least 20 feet apart.. This product is very informative, and works well, I love the ability to add items to my Todo list, Shopping List and my Grocery List. Young Grand kids love it for Playing Prime Music and answers to Homework questions.. ",
Auldnick,"April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"Exercise in frustration.  Struggles when you have people with different accents in the house.  I was given it as a gift and unfortunately I have all my music on Google Play which the dot is unable to access.  And unless you are the Amazon Prime primary account holder you can't even access Prime Music.  For us instead of being a Dot its a Brick as its easier to look some thing up on our phones than try to get Alexa go give a meaningful answer.  Will perhaps try Google Home. ",
Richard,"January 5, 2017 ",5.0,"What does it do?  Nearly anything you want it to do!  You can add many different add on's (most at no charge) to customize it for your lifestyle. Ask Alexia anything and she will respond with your anwser!  This is great way to start up your smart home!  If you live alone it's like having someone in the house with you to ask questions you would ask a real person.  Best 50.00 dollars ever spent! ",
"Phil Horse","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Product is responsive as expected but just ok to me. With no music now (you have to subscribe to the music service) its not as I would have expected. Would not recommend this to anyone - she barley answers questions asked :( other models by different manufacturer work better. ",
"Michael S","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"The microphone has worked well.  Mainly use it as a bluetooth speaker, timer, the occasional question, and for reminders.  It works well, but we don't use it as much as I thought we would.  The things we do use the Echo dot for are useful and work well.Like it ",
"Debra Hernstrom","April 16, 2017 ",2.0,"The thunder Does calm down my dog quite a bit. I like it better than the thunder shirt in warmer weather so he doesn't get hot while wearing it. It would be nice to have somewhere to have an attachment on the thunder So you can attach it to a belt or a purse so you don't lose it. This is my second one, and they're too expensive to lose. Thank you for a final product. ",
"Sam STEVENS","March 16, 2017 ",4.0,"It a little learning curve and I'm still in the curve. I think I will enjoy once I know what to ask for and have enough skill to get the answer.  I like it, my wife hates it. Because it like learning to play a guitar, the practice drives everyone else nuts ",
"Alex Q","March 25, 2017 ",5.0,"I love my Echo, but I dislike that it requires its own USB brick plug. I would prefer either a standard barrel plug type power cord or for it to run on standard USB power. I don't really see the need for USB when you require 9V or whatever over the cable. ",
Jordon,"March 7, 2017 ",5.0,"I live in a small apartment, and I have a Bluetooth soundbar, and a Bluetooth speaker in the shower (works better on the soundbar; can't talk to it/control it when I'm in the shower).  The function I use the most on it is adding items to my shopping list. ",
"This Tech Guy","March 20, 2017 ",4.0,"I LOVE this thing!    I have it enabled to control my lights in my small apartment and could not be happier! It's as simple as &#34;Alexa, turn on the desk light&#34; and she says &#34;ok&#34;! This is completely configurable to meet anyone's desires. You can name the lights anything you want and Alexa will learn the names. I would suggest you do some research after you get the basic set-up complete to learn how to customize your set-up. You will enjoy being able to dim and turn off or on your lights by simply asking Alexa to do it.    I also love the fact that you can just have her set an alarm. That is soooo handy it's not even funny.    This is just a couple of the things Alexa is capable of so if you even have an interest in jumping on the IOT bandwagon, do yourself a favor and spend the fifty bucks to see what Alexa has to offer. I'm glad I did! ",
"Amazon Customer","March 20, 2017 ",5.0,"None of the &#34;smart home&#34; devices that I have bought worked - either bad &#34;skill&#34; software or other issues. It's a nuisance to have to say the name of the skill before asking a question. Can't remember the name of all of them. It should work without having to say the skill name. ",
Panther,"April 16, 2017 ",5.0,"Love it - Highly recommend adding amazon music.  Kids love talking to Alexa - and I have it connected to my bluetooth speakers- we rock out all the time, add items to lists.  I have started developing some services for it - and it works perfectly! ",
Doriam91,"March 3, 2017 ",3.0,"Good sound, great music, and perfect size. The only bad thing is that whenever I connect it with my cellphone over Bluetooth the sound quality is worst and the volume is lower. Also I THOUGHT it was wireless and chargeable and it is NOT. This is completely power plug dependent. ",
Ariel,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my parents who are in their 60s. They both have a lot of fun asking Alexa questions, she tells them jokes, the news, plays music and reads them the news. They're working towards getting smart appliances, smart lights, etc, to fully take advantage of Alexa. Its kept my mom company, she said, as a mother of 9 children who have since moved out of the house. I was very happy with it, as are they and it was easy to set up :) ",
N8,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I own three Echo products (Echo, Dot v1, Dot v2). I've arranged them strategically around my home, and unless there's a lot of noise interference one of them always hears me. My kids absolutely love them. Somehow, Alexa understands my three-year-old's requests, and we subsequently are listening to a lot of &quot;Peanut Butter Jelly Time&quot; by Chip-Man &amp; The Buckwheat Boys. In spite of that, I still love having Alexa in my home.    This product is amazing and comes at a great price. I'd probably buy more of them if I had a place to put them. The Dot is a perfect alternative to the much larger Echo, especially if you are like me and already have one and would just like to add voice automation to another area. When I purchased the cheaper 2nd gen Dot, I was expecting it to be lesser quality than the first, but it is most definitely not. The sound quality from the device isn't great, but that was expected. Hooking it up to a Bluetooth speaker is a breeze, but my usage of the Dot is primarily for home automation purposes. What is more important for me with this device is that the sound created can actually travel across the room if necessary, and I haven't been disappointed by it yet. ",
Jennifer,"January 17, 2017 ",5.0,"Still learning how to use this thing since getting it for Christmas by its awesome. It's kind of funny because our daughters name is Alexa and this is what this thing is called, so we have to be careful when saying her name. You can change the name she goes by, but we like it as it is. The app set up for the device walks you through every single step and is very helpful. I was concerned we wouldn't know how to use it because it's a hi tech thing but it's great. She understands things I wouldn't imagine she would and answers very fast. The initial set up takes about 10 minutes and then you're ready to go! This is a rest addition to a home! ",
"W. Moore","November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"This is my second Dot.  I love them.  They do not do a very good job of working together, though.  Whichever one hears the command, is the one that executes it. Normally, this would be good, I guess. However, when I tell one to set an alarm, that is the only one that alarms, or knows I asked for the alarm. So, if I'm out of hearing range, and next to the other one - I don't hear it. Also, when the alarm is sounding, and I tell the other one to stop it, the alarm keeps sounding in the one it was set with.  They are fairly limited in their function. They cannot find my wifi household control switches and socket - they are the wrong manufacturer??  The switches do not require a hub, and are accessible from any web hotspot.  They can connect to my other Bluetooth devices like the phones, but they cannot play the music on them.  When the wifi goes out, they won't do anything except say they are having trouble connecting - try later.  The Dot's are getting better, and the sound is very good. They hear fairly well. They are able to provided many answers, but not as good as the voice search on my phones. ",
"Jackie Blair","December 27, 2016 ",4.0,"Oh Alexa, how do I love thee, let me count the ways.  From integrating smart plugs to playing me music to making me feel safer, I cannot say enough good things about this Echo Dot.  Other reviews have said she has problems hearing them but I have not found this to be the case at all.  I keep my only one in my bedroom for now (I plan to get more!) and she can hear me from my living room if I speak just slightly louder than normal!  She hears me over her own music too.  I have her play me soft jazz at night before bed, like I'm in a 5 star resort.  I have her play rain sounds when I can't fall asleep.  She reads (or plays) my latest book on Audible.  I have her integrated to one TP Link smart plug at the moment (totally plan to get more) and that was super easy and it works perfectly!  I live alone so I set up &#34;Ask My Buddy&#34; and have tested it and it works perfectly as well and brings me so much peace of mind!  I cannot say enough.  With time, more skills will be added and this will get better and better.  The speaker is totally sufficient for me as well so I'm glad I didn't spend the extra money on the full sized Echo. ",
"Shoe Mom","December 21, 2016 ",5.0,"This is honestly the best product.  I have the full size Amazon Echo, the Tap and now three Dots. I take the Tap on road trips and the Dots are in the basement, kitchen and bedroom.  I need to order more for each bedroom.  It is so convenient to be able to get my flash briefing, check the weather and call an Uber from any room.  I am excited to see more uses for this technology. Another reason why Amazon is my absolute favorite!! ",
T.M.,"January 5, 2017 ",5.0,"PARENT WARNING:  You can not filter songs with explicit lyrics for this device and &#34;Alexa Play&#34; picks up where you left off. This is a big problem for families with younger kids. My teenager listened to an explicit song one night and stopped it in the middle, then my 5 yo walked up the next morning and said &#34;Alexa play&#34;...  There is no way to prevent this via settings, so make sure you are aware and talk to your kids before using the device. I assumed there wouldn't be songs with explicit lyrics available for my son to play via Amazon Prime and didn't know it would pick up where he left off if he played them.    I also bought this device thinking it could give verbal reminders at given times, but it can't. It adds it to your reminders list and you have to ask it to tell you what's on your reminders. The main reason I bought it was for verbal timed reminders.    It is nice/novel, but as a parent it's not what I needed and has introduced some new parenting challenges that I'm not sure are worth it. ",
DH,"November 7, 2016 ",5.0,"Picked up one from Bed Bath and Beyond.    Voice commands and recognition work great. Only 4 stars because voice command flexibility is less than OK Google.    Small learning curve to get used to the base voice commands. Could pick it up after 15 minutes of picking commands and searching for neat commands online. Minimalist packaging and directions/guide is discouraging for getting started.    Past the basic commands, Alexa requires customization from &#34;skills&#34; or apps. You must find skills to enable that will meet your needs for recipes, news, trivia, weather, or other plethora of information. This is similar to shopping the Google Play store, where there are many interesting apps, but most don't work perfectly well.    The first group of skills I added showed clunky voice command responses that required 10-15 seconds of listening to instructions that I could not interrupt. If skills are not well developed, long uninterruptable instructions are repeated.    The current selection of skills is good, and has great potential for more to come.  But Amazon should trim down the skills to an elite tiered skills that are well developed. ",
"Amazon Customer","October 26, 2016 ",3.0,"I have looked at these for a while, and while I did not need it I decided to buy it on a whim and I am very happy I did.  I've only had it a day so I've not even scratched the surface of learning what it can do but I am really enjoying it so far.  It is amazing all the things this little Echo Dot can do.  I am looking forward to setting up smart features around my home. I am very pleased with this little thing. ",
XaQaRa,"November 17, 2016 ",4.0,"Wish I had purchased from AMAZON, cheaper than purchasing from QVC.    Nonetheless, I didn't think I would enjoy this little DOT - gadget as much as I do.  Set-up was as easy as plugging it in and waiting for it to find &#34;my cloud&#34;. I have already heard jokes, and music, said 'thank you' and 'good night', and have gotten replies for ALL.... You don't have to shout to get her to respond.    It's like we adults have our own little &#34;teddy bear&#34;, or, 'comfort area'. When we adults need a 'lullaby' or a corny joke - we've got something to help us out, TOO !!  Wait until my grandkids get a load of this ...LOL ",
