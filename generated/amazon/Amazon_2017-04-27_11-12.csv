"Roy Estaris","December 1, 2016 ","5.0 out of 5 stars ","My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.  Happy Holidays  Roy ",
DJ,"April 12, 2017 ","3.0 out of 5 stars ","Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.    If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!    Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.    1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.    2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.    3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, &#34;Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees&#34; got no result, so I tried &#34;Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees&#34; and she picked it up perfectly.    4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.    5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  &#34;Alexa, play 90s music&#34;, &#34;Alexa, play indie music&#34;, and &#34;Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds&#34;.  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great &#34;freebie&#34; if you're a prime member.    6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.    7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.    8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to &#34;Alexa, what's the definition of&#34;, &#34;Alexa, how far away is&#34;, &#34;Alexa, Wikipedia&#34; (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask &#34;Alexa, tell me more&#34;).  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.    9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).    Suggestions for Improvement:    1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like &#34;How far away is the sun&#34; but I'd really like too see Amazon add a &#34;search&#34; function.    2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.    3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings. ",
"Bryant R.","December 1, 2016 ","5.0 out of 5 stars ","So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.  A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.  So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.  The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.  I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.  Thanks for letting me rant ",
RaVen,"October 24, 2016 ","5.0 out of 5 stars ","Thanks for taking the time to read this review!  This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say &#34;alexa&#34; and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.    We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its &#34;multi-room voice recognition&#34; technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word &#34;alexa&#34; on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a &#34;multi-device&#34; plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited      The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.  The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.    At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is &#34;alexa turn on the lights&#34; and our downstairs lights spring into action.    My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with &#34;sorry I didn't get that&#34;  Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.    Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your &#34;free&#34; music.    I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up &#34;New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing&#34; under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.    I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device. ",
"Brian C","January 10, 2017 ","5.0 out of 5 stars ","There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.    I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.    My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo &#34;skills&#34; that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the &#34;skills&#34; not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.    Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.    The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached. ",
Andrew,"October 24, 2016 ","5.0 out of 5 stars ","This was my first Echo purchase and I am overall very pleased with it's performance. Initially, I was worried that it was going to be a Siri knockoff with only a limited number of voice commands and functions with constant errors; however, I have not received single error response since I have owned it. I am an Amazon Prime member and from the time I clicked confirm purchase to the time it was delivered to my doorstep only took 3 days, and best part of all, shipping was free.    I currently have mine sitting by my bed and have synced it with the app, available on for all phone types, which allows me to carry out a number of voice commands including: &#34;Alexa, set an alarm for..., check the weather, play Pandora, or tell me a joke.&#34; The app interface is a little clunky at times, but you're able to see the history of recent requests, and Alexa is constantly learning and adapting to your specific commands and style.    If you are looking to buy an Echo Dot because you want a cheap introduction into Bluetooth connectivity with household lights, televisions, gaming systems, thermostats, or other Echo products then buy this Echo Dot. I am working with a grad student budget, and for $50 dollars this sleek and sexy &#34;command station&#34; was worth every penny. I did not receive any compensation for this review, I am writing it because I debated on buying one for about a week before pulling the trigger, and I just want to speed up the process for people like me who may be waffling...trust me, its completely worth the $50.

"Amazon Customer","December 14, 2016 ","5.0 out of 5 stars ","Honestly, I love mine but obviously, there are some things that could be better. What do I love about it? Both my boyfriend and I downloaded the app and have access to a shopping list that we can both use at the grocery store depending on who is there. With a simple wake up word (her name) and the command of adding an item to the shopping list, it appears in the app. I can ask for a flash briefing and NPR news is retrieved and I am caught up all over the world in subjects from politics all the way to sports news. She also gives great weather information so that I am able to plan for my day ahead. Alexa can learn many skills that continue to evolve. Knowledge from what wines to pair with what meats and good cooking substitutes to helping with a drinking game and other games & trivia. Alexa comes in handy when I need a hands-free timer in the kitchen or an alarm for a nap. Now, what I don't really like but can get passed it once I get the hang of it. Sometimes you ask a question but she doesn't understand the question but you reword the question and she is able to understand it. So just be sure your wording the question correctly. Also, remember that Alexa is always listening. ",
"Kathryn H.","March 26, 2017 ","5.0 out of 5 stars ","Love the Echo Dot. I got the buy 3 discount, which makes it worth while. I am sure there will be more things added and improved on in time, but so far it is a bit limited in what I can use it for. We don't have a modern set up in our house so that it can adjust lights or temp so that part is useless to us.  I got it mostly for my 93 year old mother whom I take care of, as she constantly asks me what day or time it is, so now she can ask the Echo. I also like the ability to get a weather report for the day, and I still need to set up the calendar for daily events for mom, once I get that set up it will be another great advantage in having this. I hope they can come up with a way to make this an intercom also between rooms so that if she needs me at any time Echo can alert me in some way. That alone would make this a really great item worth five stars.  So far my favorite feature is the radio, I just ask it to play a particular type of music and it comes on. You do have to be specific about how to get the type of music you want to hear rather than just ask it to play a particular genre. I also like that you can vocally tell it to turn down or up the volume, and to skip the song playing and it goes to the next one. I don't use it to shop with, might be helpful to some. Also, it does take a little adjusting to the way some people speak, my voice is clear but moms is a little muffles so it took a few times of asking questions to get it use to her voice, now it works good for her. The distance to where it can hear you is good and volume on answering and music is great, you don't really need added speakers unless you want to hear it over a very large room, or whole house.  Pros: Received quickly with free Prime shipping, ability to play music, ask for date, time, and weather without touching anything, get answeres to a lot of questions, and the ability to update and improve over time. Volume is great for small to medium size rooms, and several feet away form it. Great price for 3.  Cons: Still some limitations, no intercom set up yet, need to be specific about where to get radio from. ",
Vince,"April 12, 2017 ","4.0 out of 5 stars ","I have the regular Echo and it's amazing. I bought the Echo Dot for my dad who had been using a little antenna radio around the house. This isn't mobile but it allows him to play Pandora or just to tell it what kind of music to play. It was purchased through my account but I created an Amazon account for him so I could link Pandora to it. That way he has his own Pandora account. Echo can switch accounts at any time with a voice command but we keep them on the primary users' account. I was worried the audio quality wouldn't be any good based on reviews but it's really not bad at all if you're replacing a little radio. It's not audiophile fill the room with brilliance quality, but it gets the music out and doesn't sound tinny or anything. My dad really enjoys it. ",
"Marquino Gadget guru","April 18, 2017 ","4.0 out of 5 stars ","This is what I`ve been waiting for!!!!  It is simple amazing what you can do with technology nowadays, Amazon is always innovating and staying on top with technology.  This new Amazon Echo Dot does what it says it does and provides all the necessary information by simply asking!  We like it to much i got a second device to add it in my room, been able to connect to your Bluetooth speakers and devices you can automate lots of things.  Great job Amazon ",
