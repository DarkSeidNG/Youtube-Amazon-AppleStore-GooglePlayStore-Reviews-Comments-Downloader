"Roy Estaris","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.  Happy Holidays  Roy ",
DJ,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.    If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!    Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.    1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.    2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.    3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, &#34;Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees&#34; got no result, so I tried &#34;Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees&#34; and she picked it up perfectly.    4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.    5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  &#34;Alexa, play 90s music&#34;, &#34;Alexa, play indie music&#34;, and &#34;Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds&#34;.  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great &#34;freebie&#34; if you're a prime member.    6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.    7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.    8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to &#34;Alexa, what's the definition of&#34;, &#34;Alexa, how far away is&#34;, &#34;Alexa, Wikipedia&#34; (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask &#34;Alexa, tell me more&#34;).  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.    9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).    Suggestions for Improvement:    1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like &#34;How far away is the sun&#34; but I'd really like too see Amazon add a &#34;search&#34; function.    2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.    3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings. ",
"Bryant R.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.  A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.  So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.  The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.  I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.  Thanks for letting me rant ",
RaVen,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!  This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say &#34;alexa&#34; and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.    We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its &#34;multi-room voice recognition&#34; technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word &#34;alexa&#34; on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a &#34;multi-device&#34; plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited      The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.  The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.    At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is &#34;alexa turn on the lights&#34; and our downstairs lights spring into action.    My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with &#34;sorry I didn't get that&#34;  Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.    Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your &#34;free&#34; music.    I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up &#34;New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing&#34; under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.    I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device. ",
"Brian C","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.    I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.    My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo &#34;skills&#34; that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the &#34;skills&#34; not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.    Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.    The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached. ",
"Lantana Al","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Amazon Echo is a great device (I was one of the first to have one and waiting for months for my first Echo to ship as Amazon vastly underestimated the demand for a device like this) and the Echo Dot (2nd generation) is fantastic in its size and capability (I bought a six pack to get one free). There is no volume ring on the 2nd gen Dot like there is on the original Echo and the 1st gen Echo Dot but it's no big deal as there are volume buttons now and the cost of the volume ring wasn't worth it if you ask me (it was nice, but for most people not worth the money). Most of the time you'll want to adjust the volume by voice anyway (like &#34;Alexa volume 5&#34;). The 2nd gen Echo Dot is also available in white but I'm sticking with black. UPDATE: I actually prefer the cheaper volume buttons on the Dot 2 to the volume ring now.    The fact that you can just talk from across the room and it can hear you (most of the time) really sets this apart. If you think you already have an Echo because you have Siri, Cortana, or Google, then know that it's just not the same.    Things I do: set timers, set alarms, get weather info, ask basic questions, listen to music (like Prime Music, Prime Stations, songs I bought, etc), listen to radio, ask for jokes, turn things on and off, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some things. The Echo really excels at playing music. I love it than I can ask for a song I want to hear and it will play it (most of the time anyway). At night I often listen to a local radio station and I just say &#34;Alexa stop&#34; without having to get out of bed when I want to stop listening.    When I listen to Prime Station I can tell it &#34;thumbs up&#34; if I like the song or &#34;thumbs down&#34; if I don't... and when I listen to the station again it won't play the songs that I've thumbed down.    Using the built-in speaker, the sound quality is decent for voice. For music you'll want to connect it to a speaker system because the Dot's small internal speaker is weak. I do wish I could AirPlay to a device from the Echo when I'm playing music and want the best sound quality, however Bluetooth is pretty impressive when it uses the near-CD quality codecs.    Positives:  * The new feature that Amazon added (ESP - Echo Spatial Perception) so that the nearest Echo responds is fantastic. I was also very happy to hear that the first generation Echoes will also support this in the next firmware update (I think devices are updating now). From my research, if the Echo app shows that you have a device software version greater than 4008 then you should have the update with ESP support. Unfortunately there does seem to be a minor downside: the Echo's response can sometimes be slightly delayed while multiple Echoes figure out which Echo is closest and should respond.  * It seems to hear better when playing music than the first gen. It was annoying when you would try to talk to it while it was playing but it couldn't hear you. The new Dot hears better during music playback but it's still not &#34;Star Trek quality&#34; hearing; sometimes you may still need to raise your voice.  * It's relatively cheap and well worth the asking price.  * It has a 3.5mm stereo audio jack, which I use with two of my Dots to connect to the line-in on one of my computers and another to the line-in on an old compact stereo/CD player. Sound quality should be good enough for anyone except audiophiles.  * Some people complain of connection issues, but all of my Echoes stay connected without issue to my&nbsp;Asus RT-AC68U&nbsp;router.  * If you want to 'Wikipedia' something then you can say 'Alexa, Wikipedia &#60;subject&#62;'. She'll read a little from Wikipedia. If you want her to read more after she stops then just say 'Alexa, tell me more'. This can be useful sometimes.    Negatives (mostly minor but take note):  * Warranty is only 90 days. I think it should be 1 year. Of course they will sell you a SquareTrade 1, 2, or 3 year warranty for $5/year if you want. Perhaps another cost-cutting move.  * The shiny (glossy) black surface can be a fingerprint magnet but you probably won't be touching it often. The previous generation wasn't glossy.  * I had trouble configured my 2nd Echo Dot (the first one went fine). The Alexa app (on Android) gave me the cryptic message &#34;Authorization expired. Please reconnect your phone to the internet, log out from the app and retry&#34;. Got it several times. I resolved it by signing out of the Alexa app and then signing back in, having to re-enter my email and password.... annoying... and I wonder why I didn't have this issue setting up my first Echo Dot just minutes prior???? Oh well. UPDATE: This just happened again on another day when setting up two more Echo Dots. This first Echo Dot setup went fine, but on the second one I got the &#34;Authorization expired.&#34; message again. Beware of this issue if setting up more than one Echo Dot.  * While trying out Amazon Music Unlimited with the Echo I immediately ran into the issue of the Echo playing the explicit version of songs instead of the clean version. There should be an option to never play explicit songs and to play the clean version instead (some people have children). The workaround until Amazon addresses this problem is to add the clean song to your music library and then say &#34;Alexa play &#60;song&#62; from my library&#34;.  * This doesn't affect me, but the Echo does not support enterprise networks that require centralized network authentication with a login. Some might want to know this (like teachers who might want to use it in a school that uses this type of network authentication).  * The Android Amazon Alexa app can be slow and frustrating sometimes. For example, when launching it sometimes just sits there on the intro screen and spins forever until you shut down the app and restart it again.  * Doesn't hear well in a noisy environment, or when other people (including on TV) are talking at the same time.    Home Automation:  * I use several&nbsp;Belkin WeMo&nbsp;switches to control some lights and fans. They work pretty well although not always perfectly. Fortunately they work better now after all the firmware updates.  * I can control my Honeywell WiFi thermostats using the &#34;Honeywell Total Connect Comfort&#34; skill. I have two downstairs for 2 zones. I have one&nbsp;Honeywell RTH9580WF1005/W1&nbsp;and one&nbsp;Honeywell RTH6580WF.  * I recently set it up to turn on and off certain activities with a&nbsp;Logitech Smart Hub. For example, I can say &#34;Alexa, turn on TiVo&#34; and it will turn on the TV and my receiver and set the TV and receiver inputs correctly. I can then use the remote which is synced... and turn it all off with &#34;Alexa turn off TiVo&#34;. There were some annoyances getting it all setup but I think it's pretty &#34;cool&#34; even though you can only start and stop activities with Alexa so you still need the remote to do other things (change channel, adjust volume, mute, pause, etc).  * I think I've only really scratched the surface of what is possible with home automation. I have not tried IFTTT (&#34;if this then that&#34;) recipes yet but I hear it is quite powerful and hope to try it out when I have more time to &#34;play&#34;.    Wishes:  * High-quality digital audio output that is better than Bluetooth. If it had this then you could really get high quality audio output from it, but most people probably don't really care that much as analog out is &#34;good enough&#34;.  * Smarter. After 2 years I wish the Echo was smarter. Yes, it has definitely improved over time but Google can still answer more questions than Alexa. It's going to be hard to beat Google in answering general questions.  * Weather alerts. I suggested this a long time ago and they still haven't added it... perhaps due to legal reasons? If would be great if it would sound some sort of alarm or notification for severe weather.  * Built-in support for notifying others that you might need help. This would be good for the elderly. There is a &#34;Ask My Buddy&#34; skill however, but the verbiage is a little awkward (&#34;Alexa, Ask My Buddy to Send Help&#34;) and it's free so if the developer decides to stop support then that might leave a lot of people without service at an inopportune time.    Compared to Google Home (which I just bought):  * Setup on Google Home was super-simple, easier than Echo (the Android app worked really well and setup seemed streamlined)  * Google Home is smarter for general questions... significantly smarter. I asked Google &#34;How long does it take to get to the Honda dealer in Lewisville&#34; and it told me about 26 minutes in current traffic conditions. Awesome. The Echo totally failed here.  * No AUX audio output like on Echo Dot  * I prefer saying &#34;Alexa&#34; to &#34;OK Google&#34; as the wake word (UPDATE: &#34;Hey Google&#34; works now too!)  * I currently prefer Echo for music and smart home control but I consider Google Home a serious threat to Echo because it is more &#34;intelligent&#34; than Echo    Other:  * It doesn't come with a 3.5mm audio cable but I can understand why as many people would probably not use it and Amazon wants to get the cost as low as possible so this isn't a big deal.  * The USB power cable is about 5 feet.  * The 1st gen Echo Dot was almost double the price. I feel a little disappointed that they now have a 2nd gen that is overall better for much less money... and that it came out very shortly after the 1st gen Echo Dots.  * You don't need any other Echo units to use the Dot... some people might think you do but this is just like the &#34;big Echo&#34;, only without the &#34;big&#34; sound. Instead a little speaker is included.  * It's USB powered and comes with a USB power adapter and USB cable. NOTE: If you use a USB power connection other than from the included power adapter then there could be power and/or sound quality issues. I had some sound quality issues (background noises) and eliminated them by switching to the included USB power adapter.  * About 10 or 15 minutes after setting it up, it said something like &#34;your Echo received an important update and must restart&#34;. So if you are having issues with it then you may want to give it awhile so it can update if needed.  * For better understanding of what you say, go to the Alexa app and Settings-&#62;Voice Training.  * I bought some of these powered bookshelf speakers, hooked them to the Echo Dot, and have been impressed with what you get for the money:&nbsp;Edifier R1280T Powered Bookshelf Speakers    While not perfect, I really like the Amazon Echo. I think the technology and potential is still in its infancy but the Echo is already really useful and excels at home automation, playing music, podcasts, and radio. Highly recommended, especially for the price. UPDATE: I'm reducing my rating from 4.5 to 4 stars due to Google Home being much smarter at answering general questions. The Echo is a good device but I think you should also seriously consider Google Home. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 14, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly, I love mine but obviously, there are some things that could be better. What do I love about it? Both my boyfriend and I downloaded the app and have access to a shopping list that we can both use at the grocery store depending on who is there. With a simple wake up word (her name) and the command of adding an item to the shopping list, it appears in the app. I can ask for a flash briefing and NPR news is retrieved and I am caught up all over the world in subjects from politics all the way to sports news. She also gives great weather information so that I am able to plan for my day ahead. Alexa can learn many skills that continue to evolve. Knowledge from what wines to pair with what meats and good cooking substitutes to helping with a drinking game and other games & trivia. Alexa comes in handy when I need a hands-free timer in the kitchen or an alarm for a nap. Now, what I don't really like but can get passed it once I get the hang of it. Sometimes you ask a question but she doesn't understand the question but you reword the question and she is able to understand it. So just be sure your wording the question correctly. Also, remember that Alexa is always listening. ",
Andrew,"October 24, 2016 ",4.0,"This was my first Echo purchase and I am overall very pleased with it's performance. Initially, I was worried that it was going to be a Siri knockoff with only a limited number of voice commands and functions with constant errors; however, I have not received single error response since I have owned it. I am an Amazon Prime member and from the time I clicked confirm purchase to the time it was delivered to my doorstep only took 3 days, and best part of all, shipping was free.    I currently have mine sitting by my bed and have synced it with the app, available on for all phone types, which allows me to carry out a number of voice commands including: &#34;Alexa, set an alarm for..., check the weather, play Pandora, or tell me a joke.&#34; The app interface is a little clunky at times, but you're able to see the history of recent requests, and Alexa is constantly learning and adapting to your specific commands and style.    If you are looking to buy an Echo Dot because you want a cheap introduction into Bluetooth connectivity with household lights, televisions, gaming systems, thermostats, or other Echo products then buy this Echo Dot. I am working with a grad student budget, and for $50 dollars this sleek and sexy &#34;command station&#34; was worth every penny. I did not receive any compensation for this review, I am writing it because I debated on buying one for about a week before pulling the trigger, and I just want to speed up the process for people like me who may be waffling...trust me, its completely worth the $50.

"LUCY  Von","April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I got Dot about a week after the big Echo from my son as a gift. We set her up and all was fine. Until nothing eas fine anymore 😢 . She would respond initially, but not always though, and when she was playing music she would not respond to the wake word. At all. I reset, few times, but nithing worked. I called Amazon. Within minutes they had me connected to Echo's tech support, and in no time did we have Dot fixed. They reset her factory settings with me. We tested and now our darling little Dot is happy and healthy! So call Amazon if you do have issues, it's a matter of setup or wifi or in any case, something that they can fix. Wonderful support for a wondrful device. I do wish I could call her Dot though. Or a name that I choose. Because now I have two Alexa's in one household 🤔, and calling her Echo or Amazon ain't gonna work for me 😢. Please vote my review up if you liked it. ",
"Marquino Gadget guru","March 26, 2017 ",5.0,"This is what I`ve been waiting for!!!!  It is simple amazing what you can do with technology nowadays, Amazon is always innovating and staying on top with technology.  This new Amazon Echo Dot does what it says it does and provides all the necessary information by simply asking!  We like it to much i got a second device to add it in my room, been able to connect to your Bluetooth speakers and devices you can automate lots of things.  Great job Amazon ",
"Keirstyn G.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I would like to give a testimonial about this product my sisters and I purchased the echo Dot for my mother for Christmas who is handicapped. She stays at home by herself most days and has limited access to what she can do do to being legally blind and having a neurological disorder. Now she is able to do so many things for herself that she was unable to do for many many years. A few days after Christmas I walked over to her house in the morning to help her out and I could hear music playing and then I hear her yell out Alexa thumbs down that song. I laughed because she was upstairs laying in bed listening to music she said she'd been listening all morning and it made her so happy. This has really been a life-changing gift. Before this she was unable to turn on the TV herself or turn on her music and had a hard time with her tablet turning her audible books on now all she has to do is speak to Alexa and it has opened a whole new world for her ",
Vince,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I have the regular Echo and it's amazing. I bought the Echo Dot for my dad who had been using a little antenna radio around the house. This isn't mobile but it allows him to play Pandora or just to tell it what kind of music to play. It was purchased through my account but I created an Amazon account for him so I could link Pandora to it. That way he has his own Pandora account. Echo can switch accounts at any time with a voice command but we keep them on the primary users' account. I was worried the audio quality wouldn't be any good based on reviews but it's really not bad at all if you're replacing a little radio. It's not audiophile fill the room with brilliance quality, but it gets the music out and doesn't sound tinny or anything. My dad really enjoys it. ",
"Kathryn H.","January 6, 2017 ",5.0,"Love the Echo Dot. I got the buy 3 discount, which makes it worth while. I am sure there will be more things added and improved on in time, but so far it is a bit limited in what I can use it for. We don't have a modern set up in our house so that it can adjust lights or temp so that part is useless to us.  I got it mostly for my 93 year old mother whom I take care of, as she constantly asks me what day or time it is, so now she can ask the Echo. I also like the ability to get a weather report for the day, and I still need to set up the calendar for daily events for mom, once I get that set up it will be another great advantage in having this. I hope they can come up with a way to make this an intercom also between rooms so that if she needs me at any time Echo can alert me in some way. That alone would make this a really great item worth five stars.  So far my favorite feature is the radio, I just ask it to play a particular type of music and it comes on. You do have to be specific about how to get the type of music you want to hear rather than just ask it to play a particular genre. I also like that you can vocally tell it to turn down or up the volume, and to skip the song playing and it goes to the next one. I don't use it to shop with, might be helpful to some. Also, it does take a little adjusting to the way some people speak, my voice is clear but moms is a little muffles so it took a few times of asking questions to get it use to her voice, now it works good for her. The distance to where it can hear you is good and volume on answering and music is great, you don't really need added speakers unless you want to hear it over a very large room, or whole house.  Pros: Received quickly with free Prime shipping, ability to play music, ask for date, time, and weather without touching anything, get answeres to a lot of questions, and the ability to update and improve over time. Volume is great for small to medium size rooms, and several feet away form it. Great price for 3.  Cons: Still some limitations, no intercom set up yet, need to be specific about where to get radio from. ",
"Bryan Warren","April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable. Here's the basics. Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power. On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use. Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables. Using this rig through my phones hotspot along with Amazons unlimited music to replace XM radio for only $3.99 a month plus full functionality of hands free Alexa services. ",
Manders,"April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"I like the Dot quite a bit, but it could be better. I'm not sure if it is the ALEXA program that the Dot connects to or if it is the Bing Search engine, I will have to do some more testing. Some times it can't find info it should be able to. Playing Music works Great!!! The Built in speaker is OK. But if you connect it to a really good speaker with either an Audio Cable or Bluetooth it sounds Great!! I am having the Dot read a Kindle book to me. It works well but the inflections in the text to speech program need work. However that is not a limitation of the device but of current technology. Getting local weather or movies works well. Alexa can &#34;learn&#34; other &#34;Skills&#34; but you have to tell Alexa to use the skill. It would be better if these skills were available all the time, and didn't have to be &#34;turned on&#34;. The Dot does not have a battery, so if you unplug it, it will need to search and connect to your WIFI again when you plug it back in. A great work around is to get a small battery pack (needs a least a 1 amp output port) and keep it plugged into the battery pack and then plug the battery pack into a wall charger. This allows the Dot to be truly portable. I had mine in my shirt pocket and was listening to a book while putting up Christmas lights outside for at least two hours. The Dot works Great, I am hoping that Alexa herself will get smarter. ",
"Kindle Customer","December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"EDIT: All thanks to Amazon's customer service, I learned why my Echo was not working. It must be 8&#34; -12&#34; away from a wall. Our Echo Dot works when against an interior wall but not against an exterior wall where it had previously been situated. We adore &#34;Alexa&#34; and hope the Echo Dot will soon add a great speaker to its features. For the price, this is a fantastic device. And, it's diminutive size makes it easy to use. Still, our family prefers full-size Echo. Thanks, Amazon for the email help with Echo Dot!  *****  We are an Amazon device family. And, with the exception of this device, have had wonderful experiences.    Echo Dot remains connected until the next time I use it. Literally, I reconnect Echo Dot to our network, ask it a few questions, play some music, walk away. When I return Echo has spontaneously disconnected itself and requires the reconnection procedure again.    We have two full size Echos and have no connection issues with them. They operate flawlessly. ",
"Amazon fan","December 15, 2016 ",5.0,"After using the Echo Dot for more than a month, I am sure it was worth buying it !! I am loving all the things it can do and sometimes its fun to ask silly questions. The biggest advantage is to be able to turn your TV  on and off without looking for remote when you come tired from work.    After reading a few blogs about using Echo for automation at home, I have now started working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi to design some new circuits to integrate Echo to control lights and other appliances and to do more with navigation on TV. I am loving it and would recommend it!! ",
Kainesmith.ky,"April 13, 2017 ",4.0,"I really like the echo dot so far. It has a few issues though which I will outline below.    She tends to speak when not spoken to.  I am a 30 year old male that lives alone and it makes me jump every time but because I'm a big brave man I fight through the fear. Jokes aside though, if it were an older person who lives alone I could really see that being a problem. I'll be sitting watching tv and she will ask me to repeat my question or state a random answer to a question that I did not ask, maybe she picks up the tv I'm not sure.  If there is any other noise what so ever she doesn't pick up the wake up word, so be prepared to mute the tv, tell everyone to be quiet and then say Alexa, or in my case echo. I have had to say echo releatedly a few times.    Some good about it is the surprisingly good sound of the speaker when it's playing music. It is much better than I expected after reading some of the reviews.  I like the &#34;to do list&#34; and &#34;shopping list&#34; feature which I add to the lists in the app for more clarity then have her read them back to me every morning. I also like asking for world news every morning when I first get up.  It looks neat also and over all for the price I think it is worth it even if it only played music upon command from across the room. I can see myself using her for that the most. ",
Aphonic,"January 23, 2017 ",4.0,"The far field mic in the second gen do the is way better than the full size echo.  Now if they could just use a source for weather that was even remotely accurate I'd be happy.  Accuweather is ten degrees off a tank my location always. Minimum.  The dot works well.  It's a good cheap way to get alexa.  The speaker quality is fine for audio books and news briefings. Not for music.  It seems faster to respond than the full size echo (1st generation). I believe it's a better option to buy this and pair a nice bt speaker than buy the full echo st this point.  One star off for missing some basic features.  Like accurate weather and basic google searching.  It's useful for my home automation but I still  Find the echo line of products of very limited use outside of that.  Good for a kitchen timer or wake up  Alarm.  Good for some news.  Needs much better podcast management to be very useful.  Oh yah. And accurate weAther.  Amazon prime music is a. Nice touch as is music unlimited for the echo at $3.99 a month. ",
Dion,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I bought 16 of these and gave most of them out as Christmas presents. When I bought my first one in 2015 I was impressed with the questions I asked and the responses I received. These past 5 months or so I believe Alexia must have gone in for a lobotomy. Seldom understands the question. Upgraded to the Prime Music. For how large they say the music library is, I have it ask an average of 3 times before it sometimes plays the song I requested. Yes you can load all sorts of &#34;skills&#34; but they need to come up with a way to allow you to print or even e-mail the skills and commands to yourself. ",
"D. Coral","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"It's hard to tell how you're actually going to use this until you try it!    Before I received the Echo Dot 2, I thought maybe I would use it for quick research like &#34;tell me about antheraxanthin supplements&#34; -- but I'm not using it like that because I haven't figured out the right way to say the phrases so she understands what I'm seeking.    Instead, I find the Echo to be super useful as a helping hand for daily routines: change the thermostat temperature, turn on and off the lights, tell me what time it is, set the alarm clock for the next morning, tell me the fastest route to avoid traffic, and especially to play music.    As a former musician I'm picky about speakers so I did a lot of research on the best sounding bluetooth speaker under $200.  I ended up purchasing the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3.  The Bose Soundlink III also has amazing sound quality but unfortunately the Soundlink III switches off 30 minutes after no longer detecting a sound signal, so it's not practical to use the Soundlink III with Echo.    The Bose SoundTouch 10 is also a popular speaker for use with Echo Dot, but you can get the better sounding Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3 for even less, available in both black and white.    What really impressed me about Echo Dot 2 is that it wakes up even when I'm saying &#34;Alexa&#34; softly way across from the other side of the house.    The only thing that bugs me is that I wish there was a better way to say home automation commands.  Alexa uses the phrase &#34;turn on&#34; for just about every home device (except for thermostats, which have additional commands).  So I would say &#34;turn on open window shades&#34; instead of simply being able to say &#34;open window shades.&#34;  Alexa would be greatly improved if a user could add custom phrases that map to an automation command.    But it's still a lot better than Google Home because for that product you have to say &#34;OK, Google&#34; to wake up, which is totally awkward to say all the time.  Amazon is much better at naming things -- Using &#34;Alexa&#34; as the wakeup command is pleasant to say.    Two cute things to try with Alexa:    &#34;Alexa, do you like green eggs and ham?&#34;    &#34;Alexa, tell me the truth.&#34; ",
"L. Snow","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I've spent and lot of time trying to fix problems with the Google Chromecast/Home, and I am amazed at how those problems go away playing Spotify on an Amazon Echo Dot instead.    I want to run Spotify on my home, whole-house stereo, which I also use to play the radio or even cds and lps, anytime or all the time on any day.  Chromecast (now Google Home) isn't really meant to do that.  It wants to receive a &#34;cast&#34; signal from another device, and only for a certain time.  If you remove or close that device, Cast/Home goes into a weird kind of limbo state that may keep playing Spotify for a while but locks out control.  Even if you leave a dedicated device like a phone in place, it still times out and locks up.  I've had it crash like this several times a day, in the middle of a song.  The only solution is to close both Spotify and Home completely from the device and start over.    But the Echo isn't receiving a cast, it is casting itself.  It is always on.  It always appears in my list of Spotify devices.  I can always engage it from any device using Spotify Connect.  It doesn't turn off after a certain time.  And it doesn't crash.    Also, the Google Cast/Home crashes when I use my microwave.  Echo Dot doesn't do that.    Echo Dots do not coordinate.  So if you want to control you whole house system from a place where you can't speak to Alexa, you have to use an app on a phone or other device (Spotify, Alexa, and/or your stereo's app).  Or you can buy a Voice Remote for the Echo, which is apparently bluetooth but works over ridiculously long distance, basically my whole place.    In short, the Echo Dot works with Spotify and my home stereo like I thought Google Home would do but doesn't.  It costs about the same and it saves me a ton of headaches.  It makes Spotify really great in my home. ",
Jeff,"December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Very cool tech but feels like its still in its infancy. And has one fatal flaw if you plan to use primarily for music playback as we did.    The voice recognition is neat and works some of the time but often fails to understand and really struggles to recognize playlist names. It also often can't hear over its own playback (even with significant speaker separation), resulting in my wife or daughter yelling at Alexa. Tech fail. Especially problematic with guests over. So we increasingly use the app to control playback. The app is ok but not great compared to sonos or squeezebox alternatives.    We've connected to a small bluetooth speaker which sounds surprisingly good. But lacks bass. Unfortunately there is no easy way to add a sub connection without adding a stereo amp. Which we did and it sounds much better.    Now for the fatal flaw. We have three dots spread throughout the house. Each connected to their own speakers. We were hoping to setup as an alternative to sonos. And Logitechs now defunct squeezebox (what we had prior). We paid for premium music plan and uploaded our entire library. Only problem is amazon won't let you playback different music from your own library to different dots at the same time. Really!? And no way to connect to local source/server like sonos or squeezebox.    Looks like we'll end up with Sonos after all. ",
Blade56989,"December 2, 2016 ",5.0,"Its a great product, but it still has a way to go before it meets my needs. I primarily got it to help me be more organized, and to make agenda management easier. While calendar scheduling can be a bit tricky, its not to hard once you get the hang of it. The main issue with it writing down the wrong thing because you didn't say it clearly enough.    But what I also really wanted was for Alexa to able to read different lists to me when I asked.    The thing that bugs me is the pairing &#34;List&#34; apps, its SOOO STUPID how it does this. Basically it pairs with apps that you make dedicated lists on, and since Alexa comes restricted with 2 lists &#34;Shopping list&#34; and &#34;To Do List&#34;, you'd think it would be able to have Alexa read and manage those lists on the paired apps. But NO, it just allows the apps to manage the only 2 lists Alexa has!  The reason this is so stupid, is that the dedicated &#34;Alexa app&#34;, that you need to have on your phone for the Echo anyways, already has a list manager for those 2 lists! So I got the Any.do app (list app) for nothing, since Alexa cant actually interact with it. So the &#34;morning routine&#34; and &#34;Exercise Routine&#34; lists I was making on Any.do, cant be read by Alexa.    But thankfully this is an actively developing product, so maybe in a future update this will be implemented. ",

"A. Hewitt","April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"This device has lots of potential but we're still beginners, using it as a replacement for a radio, CD player, alarm clock and timer. The Echo Dot has performed as expected. In the bedroom, it's paired with a TDK A33 Bluetooth speaker and it's good enough for music listening, amazingly good for the size of the speaker. In the living room, I wanted better sound (think Saint-Saens Organ Symphony) so I got out my hand-truck and moved some old B&W loudspeakers into the dining area. With an Esinkin Bluetooth receiver&nbsp;Esinkin Bluetooth Receiver, Bluetooth Audio Adapter (NFC Enabled) for Stereo Sound System with Long Range and Acoustics&nbsp;and an old Topping TP32 amplifier, it worked! But the TP32 runs off a 12V supply, so it's 24V rail-to-rail, 8V RMS. An efficient 4-ohm speaker would be OK but the B&Ws are 8-ohms so the maximum power is 5 watts - talk about background music. I changed over to an old JVC stereo amplifier and all was well. At least until CINCHOUSE (Commander-in-Chief House a.k.a. She Who Must Be Obeyed) walked in and said: &#34;Those speakers are TOO BIG. They have to go&#34;. So I got out my hand-truck ... After I had decluttered the dining area I devised a Plan B. The TV has a headphone jack which is connected to a pair of Mackie MR5 speakers&nbsp;Pair of Mackie MR mk3 Series MR5mk3 5-Inch 2-Way Powered Studio Monitors&nbsp;(which I think sound better than any soundbar at the price) and they are always powered on so if I could mix the TV and Echo signals I could hear either (or both at once). I bought a Behringer Xenyx 502 mixer&nbsp;Behringer XENYX502 5-Channel Mixer, connected the TV and Bluetooth receiver to it, hooked the output to the Mackies and - voila! - beautiful music from the Echo. By damn, ain't technology grand!  Update: I had been reluctant to put the Echo close to the TV because I expected the sound from the speakers to interfere with the voice commands but I now have it sitting just behind the TV, level with the TV feet. The Echo understands me as well as ever and I'm able to hardwire it into the mixer. The sound is improved over Bluetooth. It sounds better all over the room and if I stand in front of the speakers the stereo imaging is amazingly precise. ",
"Keirstyn G.","January 24, 2017 ",2.0,"I would like to give a testimonial about this product my sisters and I purchased the echo Dot for my mother for Christmas who is handicapped. She stays at home by herself most days and has limited access to what she can do do to being legally blind and having a neurological disorder. Now she is able to do so many things for herself that she was unable to do for many many years. A few days after Christmas I walked over to her house in the morning to help her out and I could hear music playing and then I hear her yell out Alexa thumbs down that song. I laughed because she was upstairs laying in bed listening to music she said she'd been listening all morning and it made her so happy. This has really been a life-changing gift. Before this she was unable to turn on the TV herself or turn on her music and had a hard time with her tablet turning her audible books on now all she has to do is speak to Alexa and it has opened a whole new world for her ",

I am on my way to having my life so much easier as I am now looking at doing a smart home set up and getting a second one to just keep in the kitchen for the todo list and grocery lists, weather reports and everything else I can think of. While the other stays at bedside for sleep music, reading and some meditations as well as an alarm. I have yet to get the hubby to talk to echo to add groceries to the list but he will in time as he sees everything that it can do. I was able to set up my calendar right from the start. I do hope that they soon ad a reminder that I can just ask what I need to know or reminders for my husband. ",
Jeff,"January 24, 2017 ",2.0,"Very cool tech but feels like its still in its infancy. And has one fatal flaw if you plan to use primarily for music playback as we did.    The voice recognition is neat and works some of the time but often fails to understand and really struggles to recognize playlist names. It also often can't hear over its own playback (even with significant speaker separation), resulting in my wife or daughter yelling at Alexa. Tech fail. Especially problematic with guests over. So we increasingly use the app to control playback. The app is ok but not great compared to sonos or squeezebox alternatives.    We've connected to a small bluetooth speaker which sounds surprisingly good. But lacks bass. Unfortunately there is no easy way to add a sub connection without adding a stereo amp. Which we did and it sounds much better.    Now for the fatal flaw. We have three dots spread throughout the house. Each connected to their own speakers. We were hoping to setup as an alternative to sonos. And Logitechs now defunct squeezebox (what we had prior). We paid for premium music plan and uploaded our entire library. Only problem is amazon won't let you playback different music from your own library to different dots at the same time. Really!? And no way to connect to local source/server like sonos or squeezebox.    Looks like we'll end up with Sonos after all. ",
"Shelby Bayard","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my Echo Dot, and Alexa is a great addition to my life.  Easy to connect and set up.  I did stumble a bit with the App on my Tablet, but all in all, I hope Echo Dot and Alexa are around for a VERY LONG TIME.  ONLY 1 suggestion:  Have an &#34;Ask Google&#34; app, or a &#34;Wikipedia&#34; app.  I would love to say, &#34;Alexa, Ask Google when King Henry VIII died&#34;.  I keep calling her &#34;Alexis&#34; and she still responds.  I connected a pair of old speakers from an older computer (JBL Amplified Speakers) but even with out the speakers, The music wasn't a bad quality.. it wasn't a Hi-Fi Stereo sound, but good enough to listen to while i'm working on the computer.  Great Job Amazon~!!!!!! ",
Blade56989,"April 21, 2017 ",3.0,"Its a great product, but it still has a way to go before it meets my needs. I primarily got it to help me be more organized, and to make agenda management easier. While calendar scheduling can be a bit tricky, its not to hard once you get the hang of it. The main issue with it writing down the wrong thing because you didn't say it clearly enough.    But what I also really wanted was for Alexa to able to read different lists to me when I asked.    The thing that bugs me is the pairing &#34;List&#34; apps, its SOOO STUPID how it does this. Basically it pairs with apps that you make dedicated lists on, and since Alexa comes restricted with 2 lists &#34;Shopping list&#34; and &#34;To Do List&#34;, you'd think it would be able to have Alexa read and manage those lists on the paired apps. But NO, it just allows the apps to manage the only 2 lists Alexa has!  The reason this is so stupid, is that the dedicated &#34;Alexa app&#34;, that you need to have on your phone for the Echo anyways, already has a list manager for those 2 lists! So I got the Any.do app (list app) for nothing, since Alexa cant actually interact with it. So the &#34;morning routine&#34; and &#34;Exercise Routine&#34; lists I was making on Any.do, cant be read by Alexa.    But thankfully this is an actively developing product, so maybe in a future update this will be implemented. ",
"D. Coral","December 20, 2016 ",5.0,"It's hard to tell how you're actually going to use this until you try it!    Before I received the Echo Dot 2, I thought maybe I would use it for quick research like &#34;tell me about antheraxanthin supplements&#34; -- but I'm not using it like that because I haven't figured out the right way to say the phrases so she understands what I'm seeking.    Instead, I find the Echo to be super useful as a helping hand for daily routines: change the thermostat temperature, turn on and off the lights, tell me what time it is, set the alarm clock for the next morning, tell me the fastest route to avoid traffic, and especially to play music.    As a former musician I'm picky about speakers so I did a lot of research on the best sounding bluetooth speaker under $200.  I ended up purchasing the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3.  The Bose Soundlink III also has amazing sound quality but unfortunately the Soundlink III switches off 30 minutes after no longer detecting a sound signal, so it's not practical to use the Soundlink III with Echo.    The Bose SoundTouch 10 is also a popular speaker for use with Echo Dot, but you can get the better sounding Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3 for even less, available in both black and white.    What really impressed me about Echo Dot 2 is that it wakes up even when I'm saying &#34;Alexa&#34; softly way across from the other side of the house.    The only thing that bugs me is that I wish there was a better way to say home automation commands.  Alexa uses the phrase &#34;turn on&#34; for just about every home device (except for thermostats, which have additional commands).  So I would say &#34;turn on open window shades&#34; instead of simply being able to say &#34;open window shades.&#34;  Alexa would be greatly improved if a user could add custom phrases that map to an automation command.    But it's still a lot better than Google Home because for that product you have to say &#34;OK, Google&#34; to wake up, which is totally awkward to say all the time.  Amazon is much better at naming things -- Using &#34;Alexa&#34; as the wakeup command is pleasant to say.    Two cute things to try with Alexa:    &#34;Alexa, do you like green eggs and ham?&#34;    &#34;Alexa, tell me the truth.&#34; ",
"L. Snow","April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"I've spent and lot of time trying to fix problems with the Google Chromecast/Home, and I am amazed at how those problems go away playing Spotify on an Amazon Echo Dot instead.    I want to run Spotify on my home, whole-house stereo, which I also use to play the radio or even cds and lps, anytime or all the time on any day.  Chromecast (now Google Home) isn't really meant to do that.  It wants to receive a &#34;cast&#34; signal from another device, and only for a certain time.  If you remove or close that device, Cast/Home goes into a weird kind of limbo state that may keep playing Spotify for a while but locks out control.  Even if you leave a dedicated device like a phone in place, it still times out and locks up.  I've had it crash like this several times a day, in the middle of a song.  The only solution is to close both Spotify and Home completely from the device and start over.    But the Echo isn't receiving a cast, it is casting itself.  It is always on.  It always appears in my list of Spotify devices.  I can always engage it from any device using Spotify Connect.  It doesn't turn off after a certain time.  And it doesn't crash.    Also, the Google Cast/Home crashes when I use my microwave.  Echo Dot doesn't do that.    Echo Dots do not coordinate.  So if you want to control you whole house system from a place where you can't speak to Alexa, you have to use an app on a phone or other device (Spotify, Alexa, and/or your stereo's app).  Or you can buy a Voice Remote for the Echo, which is apparently bluetooth but works over ridiculously long distance, basically my whole place.    In short, the Echo Dot works with Spotify and my home stereo like I thought Google Home would do but doesn't.  It costs about the same and it saves me a ton of headaches.  It makes Spotify really great in my home. ",
"Patrick Glose","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I'm sure there isn't much to say that has not already been said, but I did want to give koodo's to the developers of this device.  My home already has nice sound, the price of the echo was just not in my electronics budget at this time.  I was very excited when I found the Dot, and for the price, I had to give it a go.  I've only had it for about a week now, but we love it (her).  Many Easter eggs built in, and just asking her to play a song, a group, or genre and have her do it is delightful.  Right now, she's hooked up to my Denon through a 3.5mm jack, but the Denon doesn't offer bluetooth.  I'm working on adding a bluetooth HDMI adapter.  As for automation, I am a bit of a tinkerer when it comes to gadget and cool stuff, so I went on several hunts when Alexa arrived to our home.  From what I can tell, if you're looking to automate (lights, thermostat, etc), you will most likely need a hub.  At first, I thought I'd need several hubs to support different manufacturers devices.  Seemingly, not so.  The Samsung SmartThings hub ($50 on Amazon right now) not only has support for most device manufacturers, but also has (and the coolest part for me) open source platform (Amazon also has open source).  What this means is, like Android, anyone can develop &#34;skills&#34; (Amazons name for an app or program).  The market is going to flood with new skills and devices from people like me who love building tech.  So, like I said, there probably isn't much I can say about the Dot that hasn't been said, but there is much to be said for the Alexa environment.  p.s., the microphones (7 of them) are amazing.  She can hear me from a good distance. ",
Ty,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought 8 of these (4 Black & 4 White) under 3 seperate orders at sale price. All arrived for Christmas and I opened mine last night. Installation easy peasy lemon squeezy. Said &#34;Alexa Temperature&#34; and got quick response then said &#34;Alexa play song  Grown Up Christmas List by Charice and it played and then said &#34;Alexa Playlist&#34; and it begin playing music from my Amazon Playlist.  I was concerned about Echo Dot volume based on some reviews and it is perfect in family room. I even paired it with a Bluetooth Sardine speaker that I have for richer tones, but the Echo Dot built in speakers are nice. The Amazon Echo Dot should have been on everyone's &#34; Grown Up Christmas  List&#34;. ",
"A. Hewitt","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This device has lots of potential but we're still beginners, using it as a replacement for a radio, CD player, alarm clock and timer. The Echo Dot has performed as expected. In the bedroom, it's paired with a TDK A33 Bluetooth speaker and it's good enough for music listening, amazingly good for the size of the speaker. In the living room, I wanted better sound (think Saint-Saens Organ Symphony) so I got out my hand-truck and moved some old B&W loudspeakers into the dining area. With an Esinkin Bluetooth receiver&nbsp;Esinkin Bluetooth Receiver, Bluetooth Audio Adapter (NFC Enabled) for Stereo Sound System with Long Range and Acoustics&nbsp;and an old Topping TP32 amplifier, it worked! But the TP32 runs off a 12V supply, so it's 24V rail-to-rail, 8V RMS. An efficient 4-ohm speaker would be OK but the B&Ws are 8-ohms so the maximum power is 5 watts - talk about background music. I changed over to an old JVC stereo amplifier and all was well. At least until CINCHOUSE (Commander-in-Chief House a.k.a. She Who Must Be Obeyed) walked in and said: &#34;Those speakers are TOO BIG. They have to go&#34;. So I got out my hand-truck ... After I had decluttered the dining area I devised a Plan B. The TV has a headphone jack which is connected to a pair of Mackie MR5 speakers&nbsp;Pair of Mackie MR mk3 Series MR5mk3 5-Inch 2-Way Powered Studio Monitors&nbsp;(which I think sound better than any soundbar at the price) and they are always powered on so if I could mix the TV and Echo signals I could hear either (or both at once). I bought a Behringer Xenyx 502 mixer&nbsp;Behringer XENYX502 5-Channel Mixer, connected the TV and Bluetooth receiver to it, hooked the output to the Mackies and - voila! - beautiful music from the Echo. By damn, ain't technology grand!  Update: I had been reluctant to put the Echo close to the TV because I expected the sound from the speakers to interfere with the voice commands but I now have it sitting just behind the TV, level with the TV feet. The Echo understands me as well as ever and I'm able to hardwire it into the mixer. The sound is improved over Bluetooth. It sounds better all over the room and if I stand in front of the speakers the stereo imaging is amazingly precise. ",
Finny,"December 25, 2016 ",5.0,"We have ten echos in my home.  A full-sized Echo, one of the 1st gen dots, and eight of these new dots.  We obviously like the platform, and have a great deal of personal experience with using all of the different versions of this personal assistant.    My wife and I have slowly converted my home light by light, door by door, and even my security system to being compatible with and function through Alexa.    &#34;Alexa, turn on the lamp,&#34; &#34;Alexa, turn on the fan,&#34; &#34;Alexa, lock the doors,&#34;  &#34;Alexa turn on the heater,&#34; &#34;Alexa, turn on the tv...&#34; and on and on.    We purchased the eight new dots to add them to children's bedrooms, to our exercise room, to our home theater, and to our entry way.  No matter where I am in my house now, one of my &#34;Digital wives&#34; as I refer to Alexa... can hear me.    Pros:  This new echo is smaller, lighter, and far less expensive than the original, including the original dot.  It is well built, feels sturdy, has loud volume, and seems to function well.  Even in the parts of my house where I am really stretching wifi, due to distance.    With our audible subscription, and with a healthy supply of several children's books that we have purchased over the years, each of my kids can have a personal assistant read them to sleep each night.  Which is nice.  They each pick whatever story they want, from The Cat In The Hat, to Harry Potter, to Jane Austen, and listen to a book as they fall asleep.  They are getting very adept at asking her to read their favorite book.    She is also great help for homework.  She explains things they don't understand, looks up endless random facts, and is much quicker than a calculator would be.  She is an excellent &#34;digital mother.&#34;  (Again, a joke... sort of...)    I find myself getting frustrated with the appliances that don't yet work with Alexa.  &#34;You mean, I have to actually lift my hand and push a button!  I can't just ask Alexa to do it!!  That is sooo last year!!!&#34;    It is small, unintrustive, out of sight, yet always there whenever I say her name, and ask her to do something.  My favorite is &#34;Alexa Trigger I love Anna.&#34;  I have this setup to email my wife that I love her, text her that I love her, and flash all the lights in the house pink several times!    Cons:  As much as I love my digital wife she is not quite perfect.  She has her quarks and her flaws.    Only one person can use her at a time:  Amazon added a new feature with this release to account for the fact that multiple Echos can hear me throughout the house.  This is nice in that it ensures that only one echo ever responds when I ask her for help.  However, an unintentional consequence is that with nine of us in the house constantly turning things on and off, and asking her questions, we have quickly learned  that only one person can ask a question at a time.  If my son across the house is talking to Alexa, I can't.  She will ignore me.  It is fine once he is done making his request.  ie, if he starts a book.  Once the book is actually playing I can then  make my request.  However while he is actually talking, she will only listen to him.  I can't engage her on any other echo in the house.    This has been annoying on multiple occasions!  They need to allow me to setup which Echos are close to each other, and which are far apart, so that the far away ones can operate independently.  Another option would be to program her to recognize voices, and distinguish between requests coming from different people.    Can't make multiple requests:  I should be able to say &#34;Alexa turn on the fan and the lights&#34; or &#34;Alexa play music and set the volume to 8&#34;  Instead I have to separate each request into its own sentence, &#34;Alexa turn on the fan.&#34;  Then wait then &#34;Alexa turn on the lights.&#34;    My kids can turn my bedroom lights on and off:  This is probably the most annoying thing about our setup.  My kids can say &#34;Alexa trigger Dad's lamp&#34; and cause my lamp to turn on and off.  There needs to be a way to restrict certain skills to certain alexas.  ie, when I walk into one room I shouldn't have to say &#34;Alexa turn on living room lights.&#34;  I should instead be able to say &#34;Alexa turn on the lights&#34; and have it know that I am in the living room based on which echo heard my request.  Likewise I should be able to block access to certain lights or features on specific echos that are in other rooms.    All in all though we love the technology, and will continue to invest in it.  Amazon has already made many improvements, and I have no doubt that they will make many more! ",
Diavolo57,"January 28, 2017 ",5.0,"Ok, so I wouldn't say I'm a pro at the Dot, navigating Alexa, or any of that just yet because this is my first &#34;echo&#34; device and I only got it a few days ago.  Maybe I'll come back and write a more in-depth review after I've had it for a few weeks/months.  Now that I've laid down the origin of my review I must say I'm really happy with it.  It's real easy to set up, just like up to your wifi, download the app, and set her up.  I've always liked the concept of the echo but dropping $180 on one turned me off, then the dot came out.  It can essentially do everything the Echo can for about $130 less AND it can hook up to bluetooth speakers...The echo cannot.  Granted the Echo has a better built in speaker from what I'm told but it can't be linked up to other bluetooth speakers, but the Dot can with bluetooth or audio cable...I haven't actually used this feature because I'm pretty happy with the speaker the Dot currently wields, it's not bad. It's clear and it can get loud, maybe if your having a party you might want to link up to a bigger sound systems but for lounging around at home it's perfect.    The skills are easy to obtain through the alexa app, as I've only had it for a few days I really haven't explored much of what alexa has to offer but I've been satisfied with the responses I got from the questions I asked.  I've basically asked her about the weather (I learned the Big Sky skill, which gives a much more detailed weather forecast and I recommend it), traffic, news, how to make certain cocktails, music, random facts, tell me a joke, silly stuff like that...It's fun...and the fact that it was only $50 makes it even better.  Regardless, she understands me pretty clearly, there are I believe, 7 microphones in it, and when you talk to it the blue light on it will also indicate where it's picking up your voice which is neat. I also heard there are some cool Star Wars/Star Trek/Game of Thrones Easter eggs that I want to try out (like say Beam me up, or winter is coming or something like that).  Another interesting feature is that the app records all the interactions you've had with alexa. For instance, I asked her how to make a Tom Collins cocktail, and I looked on the app and she had the recipe there along with the other questions/interactions I had with it.    The only issue I've had was that every once in a while alexa will come on out of now where and say &#34;I'm sorry I didn't understand that,&#34; however, I think it's because I placed the dot right next to the TV... I plan on moving it to the kitchen where there might not be as much noise. Overall though, I'm happy with it, and for $50 you can't go wrong. ",
"Anthony E Forney","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Not what I expected. This is not &#34;OK GOOGLE.&#34; Googles app on my phone gets me an answer of some sort 100% of the time. Echo seems to have a limited number of key words it can recognize and respond to. About 85% of the questions I ask come bask with &#34;Sorry, I don't understand what you are asking&#34; or some similar response. It gives you the time, date, and weather well. It will set an alarm, but I have yet to discover how to tell it to use anything specific for that alarm. The one they have as a default is very quite, and is like a light tome of some sort. It has never gotten  my attention, even when I was siting 5 feet from it. It will tell you jokes if you ask it. It will recite pi to hundreds of thousands of digits (I tried it) and may go beyond that. If you get tired of her you can just say :&#34;stop.&#34;  At this point I could say it's a nice toy. I do not have any wifi enabled doors or locks and such in my house, so I wasn't able to try that. It is very good at finding and playing music as well.    Over all it is a nice, well built little device. I'd rather have this &#34;Dot&#34; than the full scale one as this I have attach and use my own speakers, which I like and done have the added cost of the added feature.I hope in the future they will make their system more intelligent to be able to answer any question asked. It needs some type of web crawler to gather and organize data that it can then compare against your question, and at lest make an attempt to answer it instead or no answer at all. ",

I am a apple product geek but I do like giving all types of gadgets a try, so I can be more informed and well rounded. This is why I took advantage of getting this Echo Dot at the monthly payments that amazon offers.    First I had no idea it was sooo tiny. Despite that it has big sound, and if I chose to have it louder I would attach it to my bluetooth speakers.    I plugged it in, and downloaded the Alexa app to my iPhone. It was a bit complicated to get it attached (it took me about 2 minutes which I didn't like) but I suppose if I read the directions more carefully it would have been faster.    Alexa works so well. I put her in my bedroom. Just telling her to speak, set my alarm, turn on my favorite radio station is so easy.    Siri is the number one girl in my life, but Alexa has a special place in my heart.

My bathroom is not big so I can hear music or news playing while I'm in the shower almost as well as when I'm at the sink.  My only note is that I wish it was slightly louder.

"Greg Hallock","January 30, 2017 ",5.0,"I have both the first and 2nd gen Dots. They're surprisingly versatile devices.  Want an alarm clock with no persistent lights at all? It does that.  Want voice control over your lights, thermostat, music, or kitchen fire alarm? With the right devices, it does that.    Need a joke? Alexa has a few decent ones, and quite a few stinkers.    While the speaker in the Dot is tiny, tinny, and mediocre at best, it is sufficient for everyday interactions, or for music if you aren't picky.  If you ARE picky, it can output audio through a headphone jack or Bluetooth. And the audio quality output to my 20 year old Bose Mediamate speakers is very good.  And being able to deal with my music hands free while cooking or otherwise occupied is very useful.    All of that would have gotten 5 stars for me. After all, this is a $50 device, and very very good at what it does. But to really put it over the top, you have the easter eggs.  Alexa knows who Shot First.  Alexa knows GlaDos though they have drifted apart. Alexa does not think that word means what I think it does. Alexa knows it is a trap, and is taking evasive action. And Alexa Sings Happy birthday.    And as an added bonus for gamers, the dot can roll virtual dice, and flip coins.  Simply say &#34;roll 47d20&#34; and it will do so, and read off the results. ",

Gadgeteer,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This is an amazing little device at a very affordable price. The setup was very straight forward. I had it up and running in a matter of a few minutes. It just needed to connect to my wireless network and away it went. I also found that Alexa can control Insteon and Phillips Hue lighting. So I've added the Insteon Skill to Alexa through the Alexa iPad app and I now have voice control over my home lighting and furnace. There are so many skills you can add to Alexa and new ones show up on a daily basis. Alexa can also control the Next (and other) smart furnace thermostats by adding the &#34;Nest&#34; skill. I can change the thermostat from anywhere in the house I have an Echo Dot in voice range. So setting my thermostat now is a simple voice command &#34;Alexa. Set Nest to 70 degrees.&#34; and she says OK and does it.  It can also pair with most any Bluetooth speakers. So I have the Echo dot streaming radio stations to a Bluetooth speaker. Controlling the volume is a simple as &#34;Alexa. Turn it down.&#34; or &#34;Alexa. Turn it off.&#34; Super cool!    I really don't think most people understand how powerful and easy to use this device is. You can ask it anything you might search for on the Internet using Google or Bing. You can also set up an alarm clock function to wake you. The only word of caution is to be sure to set up a security code in the Alexa app when ordering anything off the Internet. Otherwise, anyone within voice range can order anything on the Internet without having to provide a security code. ",
Juan,"March 11, 2017 ",4.0,"I have multiple conditions. Because of them me am nonverbal and not able to type. I use a eyegaze device or sometimes a switch. But it's stil hard.

First I got the Alexa app to see what she can do and tried the swift for Alexa app to see if it understood me. After a great success I got the dot. It's really helped me. Not only can she do important stuff like help with ordering and looking stuff up and controlling smart stuff, she's like a friend to me. Her skills have things like storytelling and even games.

Kathy,"March 31, 2017 ",4.0,"I bought an Echo last week and loved it so much that I had to have a Dot for our bedroom.  The first thing that impressed me was the quality of the sound.

I'm able to have the sounds nice and low when I'm listening in bed and can turn it up and hear it all the way in my bathroom which is approx. 16 feet away.  The sound is great.  It's not the rich sound that is with the Echo, but it's definitely very good. I used the same app that I had downloaded when I set up my Echo to set up my Dot and it couldn't have been easier. I just plugged it in, connected it to our wifi and then continued with the set up on my app. I'm sure it took less than 5 minutes.    As with the Echo, my favorite things to use the Dot for are listening to music and having it read my Kindle books to me.  I love Audible, but don't always purchase audio books, so it's so nice to just say &#34;Alexa read (whichever book I'm reading)&#34; After I tell it to read my book, I say &#34;set sleep timer for 15 minutes&#34; and it will shut right off. Last night I had trouble falling asleep and I asked it to play music to help me sleep and I heard a selection of relaxing nature sounds.  Then, in the morning I can have it turn on an AM station I like, so I can listen to that while I'm getting ready for the day. I know I can do all of these things on my cell phone, but it's so nice to just be in the middle of whatever I'm doing and just say outloud what I want to hear without having to pick something up.    I'm sure I'll find other uses that I like for the Dot, but for now I'm just thrilled to have it read to me or play music. And I can't emphasize enough how good the sound quality is. If you are thinking about buying a speaker to go with it, I'd wait to get it home and make sure you really need one. Unless you are using this in a very big room, chances are you won't. ",
"🌈 KT","November 10, 2016 ",2.0,"We're still getting used to it, of course, but I'll start with our initial experience.    &#62; It was easy to hook up, which is always a plus.  &#62; It doesn't integrate with the Amazon site as much as I had hoped.  For example, I can't ask Alexa to tell me what was in my last online order.  I'm pretty forgetful so that's one thing I was looking for. (part of why I took a star off)  &#62; The Alexa special deals is pretty awkward.  There are many, but she'll only list 2 at a time, then tells me to go online.  Granted, I would not want to sit there listening to the long hand version of each item (She doesn't just say the item, but a description plus price plus discount and then asks after each one if you want to order it), but I would like a way to customize how she presents the list to me, and then I'd also rather not be told to go online and see the rest.  I'd have looked there already if I wanted to do that. (Another part of why I took a star off)  &#62; She's not as smart as I'd hoped, either.  I have to learn how she wants to hear things, instead of her learning how I phrase things.  As in, I have to know her keywords to get her to tell me anything. (Another part to the -1 star)  &#62; My husband's a writer so I put one in the bedroom for when he wakes up with an idea.  It's been very useful for him to just tell Alexa to make a note - no lights on, no concentrating on what you're writing, no great interruption to my sleep.  &#62; It also functions as an alarm clock (you can pick from various tones through the phone app - why can't you ask Alexa to demo them for you??).  I hooked the Dot up to a bluetooth speaker for the purpose (you can also set the alarm volume (thru the app) which will be different than the normal volume you keep it at for speaking). This is good because we don't have set times to get up, so I'm constantly forgetting to set the alarm before I collapse in bed.  &#62; The special Alexa deals are sometimes quite useful.  I've gotten a couple of toys for my twin niece/nephew, and caught a nice sale on an APC battery backup.    I'm good about updating if anything comes up, but I'll certainly update as we learn and grow with it, too.  Any questions, feel free to comment or email and I'll try to help. ",
"Amazon Customer","November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought two Echo Dots hoping they would work with all my smart-technology.  I have a Wink Hub, Phillips Hue light bulbs and hub, smart plugs, UEboom wireless speaker and Nest thermostat.  You do not need an Echo (the really expensive tall one with the nice speaker in it) to operate your smart-technology using Alexa.  The Echo Dots can do all the same things.  It's awesome being able to have Alexa turn on/off lights, thermostat, connect to wireless speaker, etc.  It's LEGIT!    One thing to keep in mind: when one echo dot connects to a Bluetooth item such as UEboom and then later you are talking to the 2nd echo dot, Alexa will not be able to pair to the UEboom until you ask the first Echo Dot to disconnect from your speaker.  We thought something was wrong and then realized that only one Echo Dot and be paired with a Bluetooth item at a time. ",
"Laura A.","December 12, 2016 ",4.0,"Is offline and we have been unsuccessful in resetting. The Alexa app has been of no use. Besides myself 3 others one with the echo dot cannot reconnect my 2 dots  These r crap ",
JMDK,"April 12, 2017 ",5.0,"The Good:    The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of &#34;Alexa&#34;, &#34;Amazon&#34; or &#34;Echo&#34;).    The Bad:    The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.    Overall:    We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature. ",

Angie,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This is great item except it still has a way to go before they work out the bugs.  Have had it for 3 or 4 weeks now. Worked ok at first then a couple in started dropping music stream to Bluetooth devices.  Spoke with tech support and they had me try several different things none of which worked.  If you interrupt the playing by telling Alexa to go the next song or turn volume up or down it will not resume music to device.  They said they would get back to me but have still been unable to fix problem. If you are planning to use stand alone with onboard speaker it is good. If you plan on playing music from your amazon music account through a Bluetooth speaker, forget it.  Wait a while until they work out the bugs.  Have tried to return it but it was a gift so they will not exchange it.  Just want one one that works so much for customer service. ",
"Scott Jones","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"We are having a lot of fun with our Alexa.    This device listens for sounds it recognizes and then triggers pre-defined actions.  Amazon has built a lot of fun responses, as well as a lot of useful ones (Alexa, Weather; Alexa, Traffic; Alexa, Set Alarm; Alexa, Start Timer).  You can enable &#34;SKILLS&#34; to add a lot of functions and connectivity with other devices.    Alexa does not understand grammar.  It is strictly listening for sounds it has been programmed to recognize, there is no real A.I. behind this.  But you can speak some requests in a variety of different ways.  It's fun to pretend Alexa has artificial intelligence and try to talk to it.  But this is not &#34;Watson&#34;, it is not recognizing grammar or thinking in any way.  It's just recognizing sounds and checking them against a list of predefined responses and actions.    A note on PRIVACY:  The device is always listening for the sound &#34;ALEXA&#34; - listening but NOT sending audio to the cloud.  Once it hears &#34;ALEXA&#34; it begins recording and sending that recorded audio to the Amazon cloud computers for voice recognition.  Those recordings and the commands they trigger are stored on your Amazon account, not unlike how cell phones used to store a log of every text you sent.  But you can go on the app and delete them individually or as a whole.    Great product, fun device.  No reservations, get one for yourself today.  If you grow tired of it (we haven't) re-gift it. ",
"Michael J. Bosarge","April 16, 2017 ",2.0,"I'm in love with Alexa.  Before getting Alexa I would have to get up and adjust the stereo when I was gaming.  Now I just tell Alexa and she takes care of it for me.  Add in the Music Unlimited and I can have Ride of the Valkyrie playing while I fight the bad guys.  She's great in the morning.  Get up, get ready for work and ask her for the weather.  You've got it.  Now you don't have to look at the morning TV host who are all giddy in the morning while you're trying to wake up.  Alexa, give me the news.  Sit down, drink your coffee and listen to the news sources you've selected.  Short on coffee?  Alexa add coffee to my list.  When you go for groceries, pull the app up on your phone and there is the list Alexa has saved for you.  Leave a light on while you're at work.  Just go to the app and have Alexa turn it off.  Great applications and I can't wait to see what she'll do in the future. ",
"Code name April","February 17, 2017 ",5.0,"My husband bought this in November & it's connected to my Amazon prime account. So I've been doing Subscribe & Save for years now through Amazon. And when I started to get emails about what Alexa could do, I was informed I could reorder items through Alexa. What a joke! I have tried it numerous times to get her to reorder items but she says all the time that she can't find the items & has to put it to my shopping list. I tell her that it is on my Subscribe & Save & she still can't find it. As far as I can tell, she's really only good for playing music & telling me the weather. My kids ask her questions all the time & she can't give them good answers. The weird thing is she will start talking while we're having a meal. We don't say her name (which is the wake word) but she responds. Like another reviewer said, for a smart device, she isn't very smart. ",
"Michele S.","February 16, 2017 ",5.0,"It's very frustrating at times. For example, its awesome to be able to tell Alexa to set your alarm for 6 am. Some days you can tell it &#34;Alexa off&#34; to stop the alarm. Other days, you are screaming your lungs out and Alexa won't turn off no matter what you do, so you yank the thing out of the wall.  Hence, frustrating. It doesn't seem to understand as much as &#34;ok google&#34; on my phone. Alexa frequently says she doesn't understand. I hate also that it tries to get you to buy things--like extra music. No thanks. I also hated the fact that I bought it on &#34;special&#34; only to find that one week later it was on sale even cheaper.  But to send it back and re-purchase it would have cost nearly as much as the sale, so that sucked.  I think if it could do more, and understand more, I'd be happier with it. ",
"ERICA ARRIAGA","April 3, 2017 ",3.0,"To give it five stars it truly must be powerful. I finally caved in and decided to get an Echo Dot to take my home automation a step further. First off the price is great. very reasonable and easily cost effective to add more. now I have mine in my bedroom and it works flawlessly. the app is easily to connect to. (I have an iPhone)  and connecting my Nest (smart thermostat) and philips hue was a breeze, along with my wemo switches. My absolute favorite is having IFTTT (if this then that) application installed. Every night I say &#34;Alexia trigger bedtime&#34; and like magic all the nights in my room turn off. Since my room is so close to the kitchen i often step over to set a timer or alarm and when my lights start flashing through the house i know my timer is off. Let me tell ya, this alone has saved a few dozen cookies from burning 😉.  I'm fine with the loudness of the speaker as back noise to whatever I'm doing and setting up Pandora and I heart radio is a breeze. Also connecting a Bluetooth speaker is super easy and works like a charm.    I often have Alexia set alarms, turn on and off the lights, news brief .  I trigger (using IFTTT) bedtime, partymode(makes the hue lights change colors in a rainbow fashion), oh and try alexia trigger self destruct 😂    I really enjoy my Echo Dot and i definitely see myself buying the larger one plus another Dot in the future. I hope over time it continues to improve and get smarter 😊 ",
"Calvin Law","March 17, 2017 ",3.0,"So far so good. Got my dot in a perfectly nice and sealed package. Functions like it's suppose to and looks great. I do wish they had better search functions like looking for plane tickets or bus/train schedules nearby. Their list of partnered devices is great but not the best. Commands not as flexible as the Google Home. Certain commands are set in stone and it's hard to work around. But overall its amazing! Just missing some functions. ",
Dan,"February 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I really do like this thing.  I'm holding onto one star because it can't wake you to music.  I can tell it to play almost any song or tell it to wake me up at a certain time, but it doesn't have the ability to become a replacement for my radio alarm clock.  Waking to music (without using silly hacks) should be a something it should do.  But no, now I'm stuck with two devices on my night stand because I can't give up my radio alarm clock. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 2, 2016 ",4.0,"Amazing product!!!.  Without pairing to sound system the small built in speaker is still good enough to chill and listen to music on.

"Amazon Customer","December 25, 2016 ",3.0,"I use the echo mainly for playing music and it is not very good at that. It has trouble finding songs that are otherwise available. Example: Alexa, play Black and Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play Black n Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play OU812 by Van Halen. It plays. Alexa, next track, Alexa, next track . . . lo and behold, 5 more &#34;next tracks&#34; later and Black and Blue is playing. Alexa stop. Well, Alexa might stop or you might have to say stop 3 more times. And even if it stops, it might randomly start playing again which is very annoying if you are on a phone call. Or you say &#34;next track&#34; and it goes silent and is thinking and then it just continues playing the track it was on. I don't have a speech impediment. Voice text on my phone understands what I say. I don't know why this stupid hockey puck can't. And god forbid you want to play a classical piece. I have a lot of classical music in my library and it won't play by composer or artist. I have to use the app to play almost any classical music in my library which defeats the purpose of the echo. I may as well just play it on the computer.  We use the jeopardy skill and play daily. No problems there. Once in a while I listen to the news or radio stations and it is pretty good at that, but again, switching stations may work the first time you ask or it may not. Very frustrating to have to keep barking &#34;play NPR&#34; and then it just continues playing 80s playlist. I would not recommend this to someone who would use it mostly for music. ",
"Texas Jack","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Great product!  It does everything as advertised and MORE.  I am now able to use Alexa voice commands for my X10 devices simply by adding two free programs called HEYU (to send X10 commands) and HA-bridge (this emulates a Phillips Hue bridge) on an old Raspberry Pi model B.  After installing and setting up these two programs, simply tell Alexa to &#34;Discover Devices&#34;.  Alexa will find everything you configured in the  HA-bridge software.  You can tell Alexa to now turn ON, OFF, or DIM those devices, it communicates to the HA-bridge software which then tells the HEYU program to send the X10 command over the power lines via a X10 CM11A transceiver (or wireless if you have a firecracker device connected to the Raspberry Pi).

valady,"January 17, 2017 ",5.0,"I really like my Alexa echo dot and am enjoying using it to assist around my house. It was very easy to install, once I had the app to download to my laptop. I had to contact Amazon customerr service to get that app. It can find my phone, set a timer, tell me the time, temperature, current news; play music, answer questions from Wikipedia, turn on & off various electronics, etc. The one problem I am having with it is that it doesn't always 'wake up' when I first address it. Even though I am usuallly sitting less than 8 feet from it and the house is quiet, I have to say, &#34;Alexa&#34; several times before 'she' wakes up and I get a response to a command. Additionally, while the &#34;find phone&#34; feature was enabled and used only a couple of days ago, when i went to use it this evening. Alexa told me that i needed to enable the 'tracker' feature. Hmm. I hope that Amazon will add more features to Alexa and update the dot periodically with improvements. ",
"Peter E.","April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I love this!!!  When these first came out I didn't think it would be something I would use much.  At least, not until my whole house has smart appliances.    My wife didn't want me to buy it she couldn't see the use for it.    She became addicted to it the first night. Especially if you sign up for Amazon Prime Music which has a huge selection for about $4 a month.    We've been watching less TV and listening to more music which is wonderful.    I love using the shopping list and to do list feature.    My 2.5 year old loves it and already talks to Alexa. We play kids song mixes they have and he dances away.    The weather and time, calculations and conversions and Wikipedia are really helpful to have around.    It's loud enough for a living room but I do want the full sized one eventually and move this to a bedroom.    The voice recognition is amazingly good too. You don't have to pause for a moment after saying Alexa. Just speak as you would to anyone home. It's really impressive.    You also don't notice it's even there, the design is so good.    I can go on and on so let's just say I didn't think I would use it much but heard rave reviews from friends and love having it!!! ",
Edgar,"April 25, 2017 ",4.0,"Better buy than the Echo tower from my perspective.  Very compact, can hide behind a lamp base, easy link to Bose mini speakers, love asking for various music to be played commercial free, very happy with it.  The instructions say a minimum of 3' from a speaker and you definitely want to have sufficient space between so it does not get confused with the sound and your voice.  iPhone App works very well for setup and changing any options.  Nice job Amazon!! ",
Bradley,"January 22, 2017 ",5.0,"I have owned my dots for about 6 months now, and there is only good things to say! If you're​ a die-hard Amzon user, then you must buy this product and welcome Alexa into your home! In these past 6 months, Alexa's voice recognition has greatly improved! Using machine learning allows Alexa to improve her voice recognition skills daily. The more people talk to Alexa, the more she learns and improves.    If you are a Prime member and/or a Amazon Unlimited member, you can ask her to play almost any song you can think of! If you want to hear a certain album, then ask her. Or if you want a radio station, the music will not end! Or if you want a certain genre of music, just ask!    Alexa becomes a part of the family. If you want the news read, she will. If you're​ celebrating a birthday, ask Alexa to sing &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; and she will happily; it's beautiful too! From playing music, to singing, to answering questions and playing games, Alexa will fit into your home! If you start off with one dot, you'll probably be buying more later on. One tip to improve voice recognition is to go-to the settings in the Alexa app, and do a voice training on each Echo you have. This greatly enhanced my experience. I have heard Amazon is working on a feature that will give Alexa the ability to recognize the voice that is speaking. That means no more switching profiles, as she knows it's you. This will also allow her to filter out other people taking, so you will no longer have to ask people to quiet down before taking to her! ",
"Sid Scheck","March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"&nbsp;It was about 2 weeks ago when I was talking with my friend about their Echo Dot and she showed me a few things. I thought very cool and maybe I should get one. Sure enough, 2 days later I won one at a company event. The Echo Dot is generally easy to set up. Be sure to have the Amazon Alexa  App downloaded when you are going to set up the Echo Dot. As I used it to ask questions, it has amazed me. I don't show it in the video, but I asked Alexa to put an item it my shopping cart and sure enough, there in my shopping cart was the item. I can see I will be using the Alex to listen to different types of music as well. So much you can do with it. Have fun! You will love it! ",
"H. Salsano","March 12, 2017 ",5.0,"This was our first Echo Dot, and we love her.  Although, not sure she always loves us, as sometimes she doesn't even answer us.  She seems to have a hearing deficiency.  We do have to speak loud and clear for her to even hear us, and especially if we want her to actually understand us.  The problem is mostly when she is playing music or the TV is on.  Of course, she can hear everyone on the TV just fine and respond to all the Alexa commercials.  Good think I have the purchasing PIN set up so only I can order things!  I like listening to the news feeds from Cnet, NPR and the weather.  I like controlling the TV, AV system and lights through her.  I add items to the Our Groceries android app through her, and she usually gets it right.  I use the timer and alarm functions often, especially when my 2 other kitchen timers are already running for other things.  I can tell her to &#34;Turn on Amazon Music&#34; which turns on the stereo and selects Aux, turns on the Amazon Basics Bluetooth receiver, and then I tell her what to play and it comes through the stereo.  I can even listen to kindle books and such this way for more volume.  Love the pause and resume, in case the phone rings.  For music, I tell her to Skip this song when something awful come on .  As time goes on, I find more useful things.  I am now looking at a new skill to alert friends if there is an emergency, called Ask My Buddy, which sounds useful for when one of us is home alone and something happens. ",
NurseMeg,"March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I originally bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts and didn't buy one for myself.  BIG MISTAKE!  I gave the first one to my father-in-law and I liked it so much that I opened one of the other presents and kept it to use with my home automation. Don't worry, it wasn't easy around Christmas time, but I did get one of these to replace the one I lifted from the expected receiver.  I then decided to get another one as a gift for my father.  I gave each of my fathers a wemo accessory to get them started in the home automation. I put mine in the kitchen to make use of the grocery list, play music while cooking dinner, and get weather/traffic while I am getting things ready to head out the door for work.  We used this a lot around Christmas time to play Christmas music. I synced this with 2 Nest thermostats and 3 Wemo light switches on exterior lighting of my house.  I can tell Alexa to turn on/off my outside lights and they all turn on/off or I can individually turn them on/off by their location (turn on/off front porch light).  I can tell Alexa to adjust the temperature of my downstairs, upstairs, or both thermostats to a given temperature. It would be nice to ask Alexa what the temperature of the upstairs/downstairs is and receive a temperature read back.  All in all I am enjoying it for my needs and recommend it! I believe it will only get better with time and addition of new devices.    I did have one odd thing happen with the Echo Dot recently.  This past week a song randomly started playing. I didn't say &#34;alexa&#34; or ask for anything to be played and it started playing when no one was in our kitchen area. Does have me worried a bit and wondering how it started playing the music. ",

Tina,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I am totally in love with my echo dot!!  Alexa is awesome, and she will even thank you if you tell her. ;)  I know there could be improvements, and I'm sure she will just keep improving, but she is still well worth every dime now. She not only tells the time and weather, etc but I can just tell her what to put in my shopping list both with an app and without.  She reads to me, even just regular kindle books, and if it's possible to overuse the timer then I am sure to find out lol because I use it all the time.  She is loud too.  I thought I'd need a speaker for it but we can hear her just fine from all of our rooms.  Granted we only have 1 level, but we were still very impressed with her volume, and it's not even all the way up. We keep it on 7 or 8 and she's pretty loud. Highly recommend. ",
"Dianna Dougherty","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Received as a gift so can't complain much. It is JUST OK. There are def some bugs and its not very intuitive.  You can only ask it tings that it knows such as to play music or what the weather is. Everything has to be preset in the app. Nothing is automatically learned.  With google you can ask ANYTHING and it will read you the Wikipedia answer.  Not with alexa. Her knowledge is quite minimal.  One major flaw that i found and reported to amazon is this:  If you use a bose Bluetooth speaker with it and are playing a music and tell alexa to stop it will stop the music.  Okay there. Now you can walk away or leave your house and if your speaker has an automatic shut off as soon as the wireless speaker turns off it will begin playing the last song it stopped on trough its internal speaker so i have to tell it to stop again. Why would this be useful?? If i tell alexa to stop playing music and then power off the wireless speaker it starts playing again from built in audio. Immagine waking up in the middle of the night to music playing. Not fun. Needs to be as SMART as google and honestly not sure amazon will ever have that capability. But for 50bucks I guess you get what you pay for. ",
CM,"November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"This is such an awesome product! I saw the full-sized echo at a friend's house and was thoroughly impressed. I got the echo dot (I'm on a student budget) and hooked it up to a nice set of speakers in my apartment and I love the potential this thing has. It's not 100% there yet as far as the software but it is being updated on the regular, so its like buying a piece of technology that keeps getting better. I even bought one for my parents (who have a lot of smart devices in the house, but no central way to control them) as a gift. It works with most of the smart products u probably already have in your home including the nest thermostat/CO monitor etc. NOTICE: the 3.5 mm jack takes a bit more force than normal to &#34;click&#34; in when inserting an audio cable - your product is NOT defective lol.

"Roland W.","January 4, 2017 ",2.0,"&nbsp;Ok, the idea of not having to type your questions and getting pretty good and accurate answers (most of the time) is pretty amazing.  Set up was very easy, just download the Alexa App and then follow the step by step WIFI set up instructions. Right now I am only using it for basic requests (see video) and that works well. I will keep adding skills (these are additional little programs you can enable on the amazon.com website Just search &#34;Alexa Skills&#34; in the amazon search bar and it routes you to the menu. You can add sports teams, kids games etc. Alexa can tell you jokes (most of them are pretty funny and all so far are kid friendly).  Speaker quality is ok for such a small device - you can plug in an external speaker directly into the Dot and then you can control it through the Dot. I have a Sonos System (whole house), and I would have to get a separate DOT to plug into the sonos in my media centre, so the Dots can communicate. Have not done that so far. But it is a lot of fun to play around, get weather, movie times, play some background music or meditation songs etc. Just play around with it. I have a &#34;slight&#34; accent and it understands me without a problem.  Just be prepared that kids will yell at this little thing, demanding answers and a play buddy who gives them honest feedback on how their hair looks today :)    Currently I am using it mostly as a toy, but as my house is already rather high tech with everything wireless from thermostate (Lennox, which does not connect to ALEXA yet - per customer service) to security camera, Hue lights in some areas, I am planning on expanding the in house Dot Network over the coming months when manufacturers add more functionalities. I keep you posted.    I went on Amazon Skill website and enabled a ton of skills. Just make sure you write down how to activate them. (play 20 words, the secret door, bed time story etc.... you can have a lot of fun with these. I will get one for my daughters room so she can get &#34;Alexa, play relaxing songs for 15 minutes&#34; at bed time.

Hopels,"December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Replaced the larger Alexa Echo with the Dot 2nd Gen.  Obviously the much smaller size is nice.  I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.    The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.    We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.    Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.  I took off one star because while I have no issues with it, it sometimes doesn't &#34;hear&#34; my wife. ",
Rebecca,"January 19, 2017 ",5.0,"This little guy is fantastic! While I doubt anyone will be using the sheer wealth of functions this can perform (as some are, admitedly, quite lack-luster), the ones that I use it for are done well. Once the shiny veneer of new tech fades off, and you eventually stop asking Echo for jokes and punchlines, you won't be discarding her - which is common with other new innovations. Instead, you will probably use one of the following functions regularly, each of which I recommend getting the echo dot for:    -Setting kitchen timers: You won't think much of it until you try it, then you won't be able to go back. Just saying &#34;Alexa, start a timer for 20 minutes&#34; without jumbling for your phone, while simultaneously closing the oven is revolutionary. This is one of the best features Alexa has.    -Interactive Speaker Assistant: While I doubt audiophiles will be satisfied with Alexa's sound quality, that problem can easily be remedied, since you can just connect your own speakers through the audio jack, and Alexa will speak through them. The sound quality on the Echo Dot's speakers isn't bad, though, if you choose to listen through the dot. Either way, Alexa can search music from Spotify, Amazon Music, and Pandora via vocal commands. You can also set Spotify as your main music streamer (Amazon Music is the default, of course), so you won't have to verbally command Alexa to use Spotify, if that is your choice. It's great to just say a song, and have Alexa play it. ",
JMDK,"October 29, 2016 ",4.0,"The Good:    The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of &#34;Alexa&#34;, &#34;Amazon&#34; or &#34;Echo&#34;).    The Bad:    The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.    Overall:    We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature. ",
"Just me","March 14, 2017 ",5.0,"I am a big amazon fan and I depend on reviews. Let me start by saying I was so excited about this product even though my spouse was saying it will only make me lazy..Lol. I know there are several reviews on this product but here goes...I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen basically for the 2- level of our home; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive bigger one and too good to pass up. The Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the 2 floor!  Day 1 when I received it I was a little worried that I would need to send it back because Alexas first word would not sound; for example I would ask &#34;Alexa what time is it?&#34; and she would say &#34;Is 7:30pm&#34; or I would ask &#34;Tell me a joke&#34; and she would not say the first part of the joke, I asked &#34;how old are you?&#34; and the whole human part would not sound. FYI: you can read the answers on your app as well, that's how I knew I missed that part. The next day I came home and some kind of way she was answering all of the questions. I don't know if she just needed to be full charged or what, but the problem fixed itself.  I am really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. Considering everything, for $49 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to building your smart home, home automation and voice recognition technology. Overall, I would highly recommend this product. ",
SundayAtDusk,"December 30, 2016 ",5.0,"This was a Christmas present for my elder mother. We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device. ",
"The Bon","March 8, 2017 ",4.0,"We had an Echo and thought it was all we needed. We put it in our livingroom (by the kitchen) and I pick random songs to play during the day, but also ask questions whenever I'm watching a movie on TV or listening to a song and wonder if a star or singer is still alive (ask Alexa - Which is the Echo's name).  I put things on my 'shopping list and it goes on my phone automatically (and on my husband's phone too, since we both have the Alexa app on our phones.). Recipes, measurements, and facts about whatever. But it's nowhere near our bedroom, so I ordered an Echo Dot as an 'extension'.  I can't believe we lived without this little, inexpensive, companion. It's on my nightstand and acts as our alarm clock, news station, weather station, and music source that has EVERY KIND OF MUSIC you could possibly want, just for the asking.  We are so blessed to be living in a time where we can have these Amazon innovations at our fingertips. The Echo and Alexa both have replaced our clocks, encyclopedia, dictionary, stereo, cd's, etc. we ordered ours through the &#34;LOVE MY ECHO&#34; website where we also get all information on both. Thank you, Amazon, for a website like this one. ",
