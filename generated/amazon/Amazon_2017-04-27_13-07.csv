"Roy Estaris","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.  Happy Holidays  Roy ",
DJ,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.    If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!    Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.    1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.    2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.    3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, &#34;Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees&#34; got no result, so I tried &#34;Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees&#34; and she picked it up perfectly.    4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.    5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  &#34;Alexa, play 90s music&#34;, &#34;Alexa, play indie music&#34;, and &#34;Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds&#34;.  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great &#34;freebie&#34; if you're a prime member.    6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.    7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.    8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to &#34;Alexa, what's the definition of&#34;, &#34;Alexa, how far away is&#34;, &#34;Alexa, Wikipedia&#34; (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask &#34;Alexa, tell me more&#34;).  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.    9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).    Suggestions for Improvement:    1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like &#34;How far away is the sun&#34; but I'd really like too see Amazon add a &#34;search&#34; function.    2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.    3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings. ",
"Bryant R.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.  A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.  So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.  The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.  I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.  Thanks for letting me rant ",
RaVen,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!  This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say &#34;alexa&#34; and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.    We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its &#34;multi-room voice recognition&#34; technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word &#34;alexa&#34; on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a &#34;multi-device&#34; plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited      The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.  The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.    At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is &#34;alexa turn on the lights&#34; and our downstairs lights spring into action.    My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with &#34;sorry I didn't get that&#34;  Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.    Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your &#34;free&#34; music.    I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up &#34;New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing&#34; under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.    I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device. ",
"Brian C","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.    I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.    My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo &#34;skills&#34; that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the &#34;skills&#34; not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.    Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.    The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached. ",
Andrew,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"This was my first Echo purchase and I am overall very pleased with it's performance. Initially, I was worried that it was going to be a Siri knockoff with only a limited number of voice commands and functions with constant errors; however, I have not received single error response since I have owned it. I am an Amazon Prime member and from the time I clicked confirm purchase to the time it was delivered to my doorstep only took 3 days, and best part of all, shipping was free.    I currently have mine sitting by my bed and have synced it with the app, available on for all phone types, which allows me to carry out a number of voice commands including: &#34;Alexa, set an alarm for..., check the weather, play Pandora, or tell me a joke.&#34; The app interface is a little clunky at times, but you're able to see the history of recent requests, and Alexa is constantly learning and adapting to your specific commands and style.    If you are looking to buy an Echo Dot because you want a cheap introduction into Bluetooth connectivity with household lights, televisions, gaming systems, thermostats, or other Echo products then buy this Echo Dot. I am working with a grad student budget, and for $50 dollars this sleek and sexy &#34;command station&#34; was worth every penny. I did not receive any compensation for this review, I am writing it because I debated on buying one for about a week before pulling the trigger, and I just want to speed up the process for people like me who may be waffling...trust me, its completely worth the $50.

"Amazon Customer","December 14, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly, I love mine but obviously, there are some things that could be better. What do I love about it? Both my boyfriend and I downloaded the app and have access to a shopping list that we can both use at the grocery store depending on who is there. With a simple wake up word (her name) and the command of adding an item to the shopping list, it appears in the app. I can ask for a flash briefing and NPR news is retrieved and I am caught up all over the world in subjects from politics all the way to sports news. She also gives great weather information so that I am able to plan for my day ahead. Alexa can learn many skills that continue to evolve. Knowledge from what wines to pair with what meats and good cooking substitutes to helping with a drinking game and other games & trivia. Alexa comes in handy when I need a hands-free timer in the kitchen or an alarm for a nap. Now, what I don't really like but can get passed it once I get the hang of it. Sometimes you ask a question but she doesn't understand the question but you reword the question and she is able to understand it. So just be sure your wording the question correctly. Also, remember that Alexa is always listening. ",
"Kathryn H.","March 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Love the Echo Dot. I got the buy 3 discount, which makes it worth while. I am sure there will be more things added and improved on in time, but so far it is a bit limited in what I can use it for. We don't have a modern set up in our house so that it can adjust lights or temp so that part is useless to us.  I got it mostly for my 93 year old mother whom I take care of, as she constantly asks me what day or time it is, so now she can ask the Echo. I also like the ability to get a weather report for the day, and I still need to set up the calendar for daily events for mom, once I get that set up it will be another great advantage in having this. I hope they can come up with a way to make this an intercom also between rooms so that if she needs me at any time Echo can alert me in some way. That alone would make this a really great item worth five stars.  So far my favorite feature is the radio, I just ask it to play a particular type of music and it comes on. You do have to be specific about how to get the type of music you want to hear rather than just ask it to play a particular genre. I also like that you can vocally tell it to turn down or up the volume, and to skip the song playing and it goes to the next one. I don't use it to shop with, might be helpful to some. Also, it does take a little adjusting to the way some people speak, my voice is clear but moms is a little muffles so it took a few times of asking questions to get it use to her voice, now it works good for her. The distance to where it can hear you is good and volume on answering and music is great, you don't really need added speakers unless you want to hear it over a very large room, or whole house.  Pros: Received quickly with free Prime shipping, ability to play music, ask for date, time, and weather without touching anything, get answeres to a lot of questions, and the ability to update and improve over time. Volume is great for small to medium size rooms, and several feet away form it. Great price for 3.  Cons: Still some limitations, no intercom set up yet, need to be specific about where to get radio from. ",
Vince,"April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I have the regular Echo and it's amazing. I bought the Echo Dot for my dad who had been using a little antenna radio around the house. This isn't mobile but it allows him to play Pandora or just to tell it what kind of music to play. It was purchased through my account but I created an Amazon account for him so I could link Pandora to it. That way he has his own Pandora account. Echo can switch accounts at any time with a voice command but we keep them on the primary users' account. I was worried the audio quality wouldn't be any good based on reviews but it's really not bad at all if you're replacing a little radio. It's not audiophile fill the room with brilliance quality, but it gets the music out and doesn't sound tinny or anything. My dad really enjoys it. ",
"Marquino Gadget guru","April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"This is what I`ve been waiting for!!!!  It is simple amazing what you can do with technology nowadays, Amazon is always innovating and staying on top with technology.  This new Amazon Echo Dot does what it says it does and provides all the necessary information by simply asking!  We like it to much i got a second device to add it in my room, been able to connect to your Bluetooth speakers and devices you can automate lots of things.  Great job Amazon ",
"Keirstyn G.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I would like to give a testimonial about this product my sisters and I purchased the echo Dot for my mother for Christmas who is handicapped. She stays at home by herself most days and has limited access to what she can do do to being legally blind and having a neurological disorder. Now she is able to do so many things for herself that she was unable to do for many many years. A few days after Christmas I walked over to her house in the morning to help her out and I could hear music playing and then I hear her yell out Alexa thumbs down that song. I laughed because she was upstairs laying in bed listening to music she said she'd been listening all morning and it made her so happy. This has really been a life-changing gift. Before this she was unable to turn on the TV herself or turn on her music and had a hard time with her tablet turning her audible books on now all she has to do is speak to Alexa and it has opened a whole new world for her ",

"Bryan Warren","April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable. Here's the basics. Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power. On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use. Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables. Using this rig through my phones hotspot along with Amazons unlimited music to replace XM radio for only $3.99 a month plus full functionality of hands free Alexa services. ",
Manders,"April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"I like the Dot quite a bit, but it could be better. I'm not sure if it is the ALEXA program that the Dot connects to or if it is the Bing Search engine, I will have to do some more testing. Some times it can't find info it should be able to. Playing Music works Great!!! The Built in speaker is OK. But if you connect it to a really good speaker with either an Audio Cable or Bluetooth it sounds Great!! I am having the Dot read a Kindle book to me. It works well but the inflections in the text to speech program need work. However that is not a limitation of the device but of current technology. Getting local weather or movies works well. Alexa can &#34;learn&#34; other &#34;Skills&#34; but you have to tell Alexa to use the skill. It would be better if these skills were available all the time, and didn't have to be &#34;turned on&#34;. The Dot does not have a battery, so if you unplug it, it will need to search and connect to your WIFI again when you plug it back in. A great work around is to get a small battery pack (needs a least a 1 amp output port) and keep it plugged into the battery pack and then plug the battery pack into a wall charger. This allows the Dot to be truly portable. I had mine in my shirt pocket and was listening to a book while putting up Christmas lights outside for at least two hours. The Dot works Great, I am hoping that Alexa herself will get smarter. ",
"Kindle Customer","December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"EDIT: All thanks to Amazon's customer service, I learned why my Echo was not working. It must be 8&#34; -12&#34; away from a wall. Our Echo Dot works when against an interior wall but not against an exterior wall where it had previously been situated. We adore &#34;Alexa&#34; and hope the Echo Dot will soon add a great speaker to its features. For the price, this is a fantastic device. And, it's diminutive size makes it easy to use. Still, our family prefers full-size Echo. Thanks, Amazon for the email help with Echo Dot!  *****  We are an Amazon device family. And, with the exception of this device, have had wonderful experiences.    Echo Dot remains connected until the next time I use it. Literally, I reconnect Echo Dot to our network, ask it a few questions, play some music, walk away. When I return Echo has spontaneously disconnected itself and requires the reconnection procedure again.    We have two full size Echos and have no connection issues with them. They operate flawlessly. ",
"Amazon fan","December 15, 2016 ",5.0,"After using the Echo Dot for more than a month, I am sure it was worth buying it !! I am loving all the things it can do and sometimes its fun to ask silly questions. The biggest advantage is to be able to turn your TV  on and off without looking for remote when you come tired from work.    After reading a few blogs about using Echo for automation at home, I have now started working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi to design some new circuits to integrate Echo to control lights and other appliances and to do more with navigation on TV. I am loving it and would recommend it!! ",
Kainesmith.ky,"April 13, 2017 ",4.0,"I really like the echo dot so far. It has a few issues though which I will outline below.    She tends to speak when not spoken to.  I am a 30 year old male that lives alone and it makes me jump every time but because I'm a big brave man I fight through the fear. Jokes aside though, if it were an older person who lives alone I could really see that being a problem. I'll be sitting watching tv and she will ask me to repeat my question or state a random answer to a question that I did not ask, maybe she picks up the tv I'm not sure.  If there is any other noise what so ever she doesn't pick up the wake up word, so be prepared to mute the tv, tell everyone to be quiet and then say Alexa, or in my case echo. I have had to say echo releatedly a few times.    Some good about it is the surprisingly good sound of the speaker when it's playing music. It is much better than I expected after reading some of the reviews.  I like the &#34;to do list&#34; and &#34;shopping list&#34; feature which I add to the lists in the app for more clarity then have her read them back to me every morning. I also like asking for world news every morning when I first get up.  It looks neat also and over all for the price I think it is worth it even if it only played music upon command from across the room. I can see myself using her for that the most. ",
Aphonic,"January 23, 2017 ",4.0,"The far field mic in the second gen do the is way better than the full size echo.  Now if they could just use a source for weather that was even remotely accurate I'd be happy.  Accuweather is ten degrees off a tank my location always. Minimum.  The dot works well.  It's a good cheap way to get alexa.  The speaker quality is fine for audio books and news briefings. Not for music.  It seems faster to respond than the full size echo (1st generation). I believe it's a better option to buy this and pair a nice bt speaker than buy the full echo st this point.  One star off for missing some basic features.  Like accurate weather and basic google searching.  It's useful for my home automation but I still  Find the echo line of products of very limited use outside of that.  Good for a kitchen timer or wake up  Alarm.  Good for some news.  Needs much better podcast management to be very useful.  Oh yah. And accurate weAther.  Amazon prime music is a. Nice touch as is music unlimited for the echo at $3.99 a month. ",
Dion,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I bought 16 of these and gave most of them out as Christmas presents. When I bought my first one in 2015 I was impressed with the questions I asked and the responses I received. These past 5 months or so I believe Alexia must have gone in for a lobotomy. Seldom understands the question. Upgraded to the Prime Music. For how large they say the music library is, I have it ask an average of 3 times before it sometimes plays the song I requested. Yes you can load all sorts of &#34;skills&#34; but they need to come up with a way to allow you to print or even e-mail the skills and commands to yourself. ",
"D. Coral","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"It's hard to tell how you're actually going to use this until you try it!    Before I received the Echo Dot 2, I thought maybe I would use it for quick research like &#34;tell me about antheraxanthin supplements&#34; -- but I'm not using it like that because I haven't figured out the right way to say the phrases so she understands what I'm seeking.    Instead, I find the Echo to be super useful as a helping hand for daily routines: change the thermostat temperature, turn on and off the lights, tell me what time it is, set the alarm clock for the next morning, tell me the fastest route to avoid traffic, and especially to play music.    As a former musician I'm picky about speakers so I did a lot of research on the best sounding bluetooth speaker under $200.  I ended up purchasing the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3.  The Bose Soundlink III also has amazing sound quality but unfortunately the Soundlink III switches off 30 minutes after no longer detecting a sound signal, so it's not practical to use the Soundlink III with Echo.    The Bose SoundTouch 10 is also a popular speaker for use with Echo Dot, but you can get the better sounding Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3 for even less, available in both black and white.    What really impressed me about Echo Dot 2 is that it wakes up even when I'm saying &#34;Alexa&#34; softly way across from the other side of the house.    The only thing that bugs me is that I wish there was a better way to say home automation commands.  Alexa uses the phrase &#34;turn on&#34; for just about every home device (except for thermostats, which have additional commands).  So I would say &#34;turn on open window shades&#34; instead of simply being able to say &#34;open window shades.&#34;  Alexa would be greatly improved if a user could add custom phrases that map to an automation command.    But it's still a lot better than Google Home because for that product you have to say &#34;OK, Google&#34; to wake up, which is totally awkward to say all the time.  Amazon is much better at naming things -- Using &#34;Alexa&#34; as the wakeup command is pleasant to say.    Two cute things to try with Alexa:    &#34;Alexa, do you like green eggs and ham?&#34;    &#34;Alexa, tell me the truth.&#34; ",
"L. Snow","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I've spent and lot of time trying to fix problems with the Google Chromecast/Home, and I am amazed at how those problems go away playing Spotify on an Amazon Echo Dot instead.    I want to run Spotify on my home, whole-house stereo, which I also use to play the radio or even cds and lps, anytime or all the time on any day.  Chromecast (now Google Home) isn't really meant to do that.  It wants to receive a &#34;cast&#34; signal from another device, and only for a certain time.  If you remove or close that device, Cast/Home goes into a weird kind of limbo state that may keep playing Spotify for a while but locks out control.  Even if you leave a dedicated device like a phone in place, it still times out and locks up.  I've had it crash like this several times a day, in the middle of a song.  The only solution is to close both Spotify and Home completely from the device and start over.    But the Echo isn't receiving a cast, it is casting itself.  It is always on.  It always appears in my list of Spotify devices.  I can always engage it from any device using Spotify Connect.  It doesn't turn off after a certain time.  And it doesn't crash.    Also, the Google Cast/Home crashes when I use my microwave.  Echo Dot doesn't do that.    Echo Dots do not coordinate.  So if you want to control you whole house system from a place where you can't speak to Alexa, you have to use an app on a phone or other device (Spotify, Alexa, and/or your stereo's app).  Or you can buy a Voice Remote for the Echo, which is apparently bluetooth but works over ridiculously long distance, basically my whole place.    In short, the Echo Dot works with Spotify and my home stereo like I thought Google Home would do but doesn't.  It costs about the same and it saves me a ton of headaches.  It makes Spotify really great in my home. ",
Jeff,"December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Very cool tech but feels like its still in its infancy. And has one fatal flaw if you plan to use primarily for music playback as we did.    The voice recognition is neat and works some of the time but often fails to understand and really struggles to recognize playlist names. It also often can't hear over its own playback (even with significant speaker separation), resulting in my wife or daughter yelling at Alexa. Tech fail. Especially problematic with guests over. So we increasingly use the app to control playback. The app is ok but not great compared to sonos or squeezebox alternatives.    We've connected to a small bluetooth speaker which sounds surprisingly good. But lacks bass. Unfortunately there is no easy way to add a sub connection without adding a stereo amp. Which we did and it sounds much better.    Now for the fatal flaw. We have three dots spread throughout the house. Each connected to their own speakers. We were hoping to setup as an alternative to sonos. And Logitechs now defunct squeezebox (what we had prior). We paid for premium music plan and uploaded our entire library. Only problem is amazon won't let you playback different music from your own library to different dots at the same time. Really!? And no way to connect to local source/server like sonos or squeezebox.    Looks like we'll end up with Sonos after all. ",
Blade56989,"December 2, 2016 ",5.0,"Its a great product, but it still has a way to go before it meets my needs. I primarily got it to help me be more organized, and to make agenda management easier. While calendar scheduling can be a bit tricky, its not to hard once you get the hang of it. The main issue with it writing down the wrong thing because you didn't say it clearly enough.    But what I also really wanted was for Alexa to able to read different lists to me when I asked.    The thing that bugs me is the pairing &#34;List&#34; apps, its SOOO STUPID how it does this. Basically it pairs with apps that you make dedicated lists on, and since Alexa comes restricted with 2 lists &#34;Shopping list&#34; and &#34;To Do List&#34;, you'd think it would be able to have Alexa read and manage those lists on the paired apps. But NO, it just allows the apps to manage the only 2 lists Alexa has!  The reason this is so stupid, is that the dedicated &#34;Alexa app&#34;, that you need to have on your phone for the Echo anyways, already has a list manager for those 2 lists! So I got the Any.do app (list app) for nothing, since Alexa cant actually interact with it. So the &#34;morning routine&#34; and &#34;Exercise Routine&#34; lists I was making on Any.do, cant be read by Alexa.    But thankfully this is an actively developing product, so maybe in a future update this will be implemented. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 21, 2017 ",3.0,"I bought one for Christmas than I got one for a present, I thought that if you had prime you where good on music I was wrong you have to pay 4 bucks a month and it does not mean you can listen to full songs on all your echo dots , Nope only one. Its 4 dollars for each one. I started to realize Amazon is pinching for every dime I got. 100 bucks for prime and than more for music. I am over Amazon. I got a Google home and I like it more it throws YouTube videos to my TV. I already had the family music plan that comes with YouTube red. Also google music is the best music service. I can find anything I want to here that Spotify or Amazon does not have. The echo works but it reminds me of Xbox vs PlayStation the xbox you have to pay more for what already come with the PlayStation. The home gives you 6 month free of service also. Echo works but you have to keep feeding it money. The google home works better with Android phones also. the home is still growing because it just came out but I think it will surpass the echo in a year. Now I have to see if someone will buy these from me because I don't want them anymore. One last thing the google works better with my hue lights. Ok google show me a video of someone smashing the echo dot on my TV. ",
"A. Hewitt","April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"This device has lots of potential but we're still beginners, using it as a replacement for a radio, CD player, alarm clock and timer. The Echo Dot has performed as expected. In the bedroom, it's paired with a TDK A33 Bluetooth speaker and it's good enough for music listening, amazingly good for the size of the speaker. In the living room, I wanted better sound (think Saint-Saens Organ Symphony) so I got out my hand-truck and moved some old B&W loudspeakers into the dining area. With an Esinkin Bluetooth receiver&nbsp;Esinkin Bluetooth Receiver, Bluetooth Audio Adapter (NFC Enabled) for Stereo Sound System with Long Range and Acoustics&nbsp;and an old Topping TP32 amplifier, it worked! But the TP32 runs off a 12V supply, so it's 24V rail-to-rail, 8V RMS. An efficient 4-ohm speaker would be OK but the B&Ws are 8-ohms so the maximum power is 5 watts - talk about background music. I changed over to an old JVC stereo amplifier and all was well. At least until CINCHOUSE (Commander-in-Chief House a.k.a. She Who Must Be Obeyed) walked in and said: &#34;Those speakers are TOO BIG. They have to go&#34;. So I got out my hand-truck ... After I had decluttered the dining area I devised a Plan B. The TV has a headphone jack which is connected to a pair of Mackie MR5 speakers&nbsp;Pair of Mackie MR mk3 Series MR5mk3 5-Inch 2-Way Powered Studio Monitors&nbsp;(which I think sound better than any soundbar at the price) and they are always powered on so if I could mix the TV and Echo signals I could hear either (or both at once). I bought a Behringer Xenyx 502 mixer&nbsp;Behringer XENYX502 5-Channel Mixer, connected the TV and Bluetooth receiver to it, hooked the output to the Mackies and - voila! - beautiful music from the Echo. By damn, ain't technology grand!  Update: I had been reluctant to put the Echo close to the TV because I expected the sound from the speakers to interfere with the voice commands but I now have it sitting just behind the TV, level with the TV feet. The Echo understands me as well as ever and I'm able to hardwire it into the mixer. The sound is improved over Bluetooth. It sounds better all over the room and if I stand in front of the speakers the stereo imaging is amazingly precise. ",
"Keirstyn G.","January 24, 2017 ",2.0,"I would like to give a testimonial about this product my sisters and I purchased the echo Dot for my mother for Christmas who is handicapped. She stays at home by herself most days and has limited access to what she can do do to being legally blind and having a neurological disorder. Now she is able to do so many things for herself that she was unable to do for many many years. A few days after Christmas I walked over to her house in the morning to help her out and I could hear music playing and then I hear her yell out Alexa thumbs down that song. I laughed because she was upstairs laying in bed listening to music she said she'd been listening all morning and it made her so happy. This has really been a life-changing gift. Before this she was unable to turn on the TV herself or turn on her music and had a hard time with her tablet turning her audible books on now all she has to do is speak to Alexa and it has opened a whole new world for her ",
"Joey Espinosa","January 28, 2017 ",5.0,"THE GOOD:  Lots of &#34;Skills&#34; (which you can think of as apps) that enable the Echo to do various other things. You can even build your own (if you're willing to write some code) and give the Echo a whole range of new features. There are some great Skills already out there. For instance, if you use OurGroceries on your phones to track your grocery list, you can enable a Skill that links that to the Echo, so you can say &#34;Alexa, tell OurGroceries to add eggs to the Food List.&#34; And Alexa will do just that.    Additionally, there are built-in features that are pretty good and up to date. I kept asking Alexa what the score was during the Super Bowl, and it knew almost right away when the score had changed.    THE BAD:  The Echo's ability to understand is very limited. It can comprehend some range of questions with certain key words, but it cannot understand context one bit. You can't ask &#34;What movie won Best Picture at the Oscars?&#34; and then follow up with &#34;Who directed it?&#34; You'll get the answer to the first one, but the second will result with the &#34;Sorry, I don't understand&#34; response that Echo owners know OH SO WELL.    Specifically with the Dot, the speaker is not great. I can understand, since it's so cheap ($50), but it's really not great. I keep a Dot in the kitchen (because it's useful there with timers and such), and I can barely hear it about 20 feet away in the living room when watching TV, even at full volume.    THE UGLY:  &#34;Alexa, stop.&#34; &#34;Alexa, stop!&#34; &#34;ALEXA, STOP!!!&#34;  If you're an Echo owner, I'm sure you've run into this. When the timer alarm goes off, or the Echo inexplicably begins doing something because it thought it heard its trigger, or it misunderstands what you wanted and begins playing a sample of some music you did not ask for... and you can do nothing to shut it off, even without background noise! It will just keep going until you find yourself with your face 6 inches from a tiny hockey puck-shaped device yelling at the top of your lungs, pleading with it to end the suffering already and STOP.    No, &#34;Okay, Google&#34; is not as mellifluous as &#34;Alexa&#34;. But I'll tell you what it's also not: COMMON. &#34;Makes&#34;, &#34;treks&#34;, &#34;plex&#34;, &#34;fix a&#34;, even the word &#34;breakfast&#34;, they can all sound like &#34;Alexa&#34;. We've gotten so used to Alexa providing her own commentary at random times throughout the day that we've accepted it as our newfound peanut gallery. Sometimes it's actually funny, but it is never helpful. That super annoying 2 Broke Girls commercial (I hate that show) where she walks in and thinks she's burned 500 calories but then she realizes it's actually the time on her watch (I mean come on, writers)? Yep, Alexa responds like clockwork with the current time. The ironic part is that Alexa can apparently hear the TV perfectly fine, but I can barely hear Alexa from the room where the TV is in. I can't imagine anybody having this thing near a television and NOT changing the trigger word from &#34;Alexa&#34; to something else.    And if you try to say what's in the title of this review (&#34;Alexa, order me a Google Home&#34;), Alexa will tell you she can't. I'd consider it a funny joke from the folks at Amazon, but considering what I've seen so far, it's more likely just incapable. ",
"Chris Hockaday","January 6, 2017 ",5.0,"Biggest piece of junk ever. It worked great for 1 day. Then I unplugged it and plugged back in and it just spins with a blue light and is completely unresponsive, can't even reset the device.  I've googled everything I can think of to try but nothing works.  I get that stuff doesn't always work perfectly and has issues, but the biggest problem is that there is no customer support.  There is no phone number to call, or online tech support to help when your device isn't working properly.  I guess I'll throw it away. ",
Ken,"March 1, 2017 ",3.0,"I haven't had a chance to play with &#34;Alexa&#34; that much.  I'll ask her what the time is just to keep her awake.  My wife thinks that is silly.  I'll ask her to Wikipedia technical items, and she is ready to tell me all.  I of course got her her own leather jacket, and so far have introduced her to the WiFi thermostat.  It was cold in the house this morning, so I asked her to set the THERMOSTAT to 69.  She did it, and that one degree made my morning.  Of course I had her set it back.  I was watching a documentary on Netflix, and one of the people in the show was named Alexi.  That was close enough for Alexa, even though said by the TV.    I've added a Z wave hub and will add some 3-way WiFi switches, and be able to have Alexa turn lights on and off by voice command.  Someone needs to write a book on all the possible ways to do this.
