"Roy Estaris","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.  Happy Holidays  Roy ",
DJ,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.    If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!    Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.    1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.    2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.    3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, &#34;Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees&#34; got no result, so I tried &#34;Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees&#34; and she picked it up perfectly.    4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.    5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  &#34;Alexa, play 90s music&#34;, &#34;Alexa, play indie music&#34;, and &#34;Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds&#34;.  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great &#34;freebie&#34; if you're a prime member.    6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.    7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.    8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to &#34;Alexa, what's the definition of&#34;, &#34;Alexa, how far away is&#34;, &#34;Alexa, Wikipedia&#34; (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask &#34;Alexa, tell me more&#34;).  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.    9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).    Suggestions for Improvement:    1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like &#34;How far away is the sun&#34; but I'd really like too see Amazon add a &#34;search&#34; function.    2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.    3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings. ",
"Bryant R.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.  A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.  So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.  The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.  I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.  Thanks for letting me rant ",
RaVen,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!  This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say &#34;alexa&#34; and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.    We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its &#34;multi-room voice recognition&#34; technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word &#34;alexa&#34; on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a &#34;multi-device&#34; plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited      The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.  The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.    At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is &#34;alexa turn on the lights&#34; and our downstairs lights spring into action.    My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with &#34;sorry I didn't get that&#34;  Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.    Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your &#34;free&#34; music.    I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up &#34;New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing&#34; under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.    I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device. ",
"Brian C","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.    I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.    My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo &#34;skills&#34; that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the &#34;skills&#34; not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.    Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.    The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached. ",
Andrew,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"This was my first Echo purchase and I am overall very pleased with it's performance. Initially, I was worried that it was going to be a Siri knockoff with only a limited number of voice commands and functions with constant errors; however, I have not received single error response since I have owned it. I am an Amazon Prime member and from the time I clicked confirm purchase to the time it was delivered to my doorstep only took 3 days, and best part of all, shipping was free.    I currently have mine sitting by my bed and have synced it with the app, available on for all phone types, which allows me to carry out a number of voice commands including: &#34;Alexa, set an alarm for..., check the weather, play Pandora, or tell me a joke.&#34; The app interface is a little clunky at times, but you're able to see the history of recent requests, and Alexa is constantly learning and adapting to your specific commands and style.    If you are looking to buy an Echo Dot because you want a cheap introduction into Bluetooth connectivity with household lights, televisions, gaming systems, thermostats, or other Echo products then buy this Echo Dot. I am working with a grad student budget, and for $50 dollars this sleek and sexy &#34;command station&#34; was worth every penny. I did not receive any compensation for this review, I am writing it because I debated on buying one for about a week before pulling the trigger, and I just want to speed up the process for people like me who may be waffling...trust me, its completely worth the $50.

"Amazon Customer","December 14, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly, I love mine but obviously, there are some things that could be better. What do I love about it? Both my boyfriend and I downloaded the app and have access to a shopping list that we can both use at the grocery store depending on who is there. With a simple wake up word (her name) and the command of adding an item to the shopping list, it appears in the app. I can ask for a flash briefing and NPR news is retrieved and I am caught up all over the world in subjects from politics all the way to sports news. She also gives great weather information so that I am able to plan for my day ahead. Alexa can learn many skills that continue to evolve. Knowledge from what wines to pair with what meats and good cooking substitutes to helping with a drinking game and other games & trivia. Alexa comes in handy when I need a hands-free timer in the kitchen or an alarm for a nap. Now, what I don't really like but can get passed it once I get the hang of it. Sometimes you ask a question but she doesn't understand the question but you reword the question and she is able to understand it. So just be sure your wording the question correctly. Also, remember that Alexa is always listening. ",
"Kathryn H.","March 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Love the Echo Dot. I got the buy 3 discount, which makes it worth while. I am sure there will be more things added and improved on in time, but so far it is a bit limited in what I can use it for. We don't have a modern set up in our house so that it can adjust lights or temp so that part is useless to us.  I got it mostly for my 93 year old mother whom I take care of, as she constantly asks me what day or time it is, so now she can ask the Echo. I also like the ability to get a weather report for the day, and I still need to set up the calendar for daily events for mom, once I get that set up it will be another great advantage in having this. I hope they can come up with a way to make this an intercom also between rooms so that if she needs me at any time Echo can alert me in some way. That alone would make this a really great item worth five stars.  So far my favorite feature is the radio, I just ask it to play a particular type of music and it comes on. You do have to be specific about how to get the type of music you want to hear rather than just ask it to play a particular genre. I also like that you can vocally tell it to turn down or up the volume, and to skip the song playing and it goes to the next one. I don't use it to shop with, might be helpful to some. Also, it does take a little adjusting to the way some people speak, my voice is clear but moms is a little muffles so it took a few times of asking questions to get it use to her voice, now it works good for her. The distance to where it can hear you is good and volume on answering and music is great, you don't really need added speakers unless you want to hear it over a very large room, or whole house.  Pros: Received quickly with free Prime shipping, ability to play music, ask for date, time, and weather without touching anything, get answeres to a lot of questions, and the ability to update and improve over time. Volume is great for small to medium size rooms, and several feet away form it. Great price for 3.  Cons: Still some limitations, no intercom set up yet, need to be specific about where to get radio from. ",
Vince,"April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I have the regular Echo and it's amazing. I bought the Echo Dot for my dad who had been using a little antenna radio around the house. This isn't mobile but it allows him to play Pandora or just to tell it what kind of music to play. It was purchased through my account but I created an Amazon account for him so I could link Pandora to it. That way he has his own Pandora account. Echo can switch accounts at any time with a voice command but we keep them on the primary users' account. I was worried the audio quality wouldn't be any good based on reviews but it's really not bad at all if you're replacing a little radio. It's not audiophile fill the room with brilliance quality, but it gets the music out and doesn't sound tinny or anything. My dad really enjoys it. ",
"Marquino Gadget guru","April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"This is what I`ve been waiting for!!!!  It is simple amazing what you can do with technology nowadays, Amazon is always innovating and staying on top with technology.  This new Amazon Echo Dot does what it says it does and provides all the necessary information by simply asking!  We like it to much i got a second device to add it in my room, been able to connect to your Bluetooth speakers and devices you can automate lots of things.  Great job Amazon ",
"Keirstyn G.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I would like to give a testimonial about this product my sisters and I purchased the echo Dot for my mother for Christmas who is handicapped. She stays at home by herself most days and has limited access to what she can do do to being legally blind and having a neurological disorder. Now she is able to do so many things for herself that she was unable to do for many many years. A few days after Christmas I walked over to her house in the morning to help her out and I could hear music playing and then I hear her yell out Alexa thumbs down that song. I laughed because she was upstairs laying in bed listening to music she said she'd been listening all morning and it made her so happy. This has really been a life-changing gift. Before this she was unable to turn on the TV herself or turn on her music and had a hard time with her tablet turning her audible books on now all she has to do is speak to Alexa and it has opened a whole new world for her ",

"Bryan Warren","April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable. Here's the basics. Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power. On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use. Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables. Using this rig through my phones hotspot along with Amazons unlimited music to replace XM radio for only $3.99 a month plus full functionality of hands free Alexa services. ",
Manders,"April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"I like the Dot quite a bit, but it could be better. I'm not sure if it is the ALEXA program that the Dot connects to or if it is the Bing Search engine, I will have to do some more testing. Some times it can't find info it should be able to. Playing Music works Great!!! The Built in speaker is OK. But if you connect it to a really good speaker with either an Audio Cable or Bluetooth it sounds Great!! I am having the Dot read a Kindle book to me. It works well but the inflections in the text to speech program need work. However that is not a limitation of the device but of current technology. Getting local weather or movies works well. Alexa can &#34;learn&#34; other &#34;Skills&#34; but you have to tell Alexa to use the skill. It would be better if these skills were available all the time, and didn't have to be &#34;turned on&#34;. The Dot does not have a battery, so if you unplug it, it will need to search and connect to your WIFI again when you plug it back in. A great work around is to get a small battery pack (needs a least a 1 amp output port) and keep it plugged into the battery pack and then plug the battery pack into a wall charger. This allows the Dot to be truly portable. I had mine in my shirt pocket and was listening to a book while putting up Christmas lights outside for at least two hours. The Dot works Great, I am hoping that Alexa herself will get smarter. ",
"Kindle Customer","December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"EDIT: All thanks to Amazon's customer service, I learned why my Echo was not working. It must be 8&#34; -12&#34; away from a wall. Our Echo Dot works when against an interior wall but not against an exterior wall where it had previously been situated. We adore &#34;Alexa&#34; and hope the Echo Dot will soon add a great speaker to its features. For the price, this is a fantastic device. And, it's diminutive size makes it easy to use. Still, our family prefers full-size Echo. Thanks, Amazon for the email help with Echo Dot!  *****  We are an Amazon device family. And, with the exception of this device, have had wonderful experiences.    Echo Dot remains connected until the next time I use it. Literally, I reconnect Echo Dot to our network, ask it a few questions, play some music, walk away. When I return Echo has spontaneously disconnected itself and requires the reconnection procedure again.    We have two full size Echos and have no connection issues with them. They operate flawlessly. ",
"Amazon fan","December 15, 2016 ",5.0,"After using the Echo Dot for more than a month, I am sure it was worth buying it !! I am loving all the things it can do and sometimes its fun to ask silly questions. The biggest advantage is to be able to turn your TV  on and off without looking for remote when you come tired from work.    After reading a few blogs about using Echo for automation at home, I have now started working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi to design some new circuits to integrate Echo to control lights and other appliances and to do more with navigation on TV. I am loving it and would recommend it!! ",
Kainesmith.ky,"April 13, 2017 ",4.0,"I really like the echo dot so far. It has a few issues though which I will outline below.    She tends to speak when not spoken to.  I am a 30 year old male that lives alone and it makes me jump every time but because I'm a big brave man I fight through the fear. Jokes aside though, if it were an older person who lives alone I could really see that being a problem. I'll be sitting watching tv and she will ask me to repeat my question or state a random answer to a question that I did not ask, maybe she picks up the tv I'm not sure.  If there is any other noise what so ever she doesn't pick up the wake up word, so be prepared to mute the tv, tell everyone to be quiet and then say Alexa, or in my case echo. I have had to say echo releatedly a few times.    Some good about it is the surprisingly good sound of the speaker when it's playing music. It is much better than I expected after reading some of the reviews.  I like the &#34;to do list&#34; and &#34;shopping list&#34; feature which I add to the lists in the app for more clarity then have her read them back to me every morning. I also like asking for world news every morning when I first get up.  It looks neat also and over all for the price I think it is worth it even if it only played music upon command from across the room. I can see myself using her for that the most. ",
Aphonic,"January 23, 2017 ",4.0,"The far field mic in the second gen do the is way better than the full size echo.  Now if they could just use a source for weather that was even remotely accurate I'd be happy.  Accuweather is ten degrees off a tank my location always. Minimum.  The dot works well.  It's a good cheap way to get alexa.  The speaker quality is fine for audio books and news briefings. Not for music.  It seems faster to respond than the full size echo (1st generation). I believe it's a better option to buy this and pair a nice bt speaker than buy the full echo st this point.  One star off for missing some basic features.  Like accurate weather and basic google searching.  It's useful for my home automation but I still  Find the echo line of products of very limited use outside of that.  Good for a kitchen timer or wake up  Alarm.  Good for some news.  Needs much better podcast management to be very useful.  Oh yah. And accurate weAther.  Amazon prime music is a. Nice touch as is music unlimited for the echo at $3.99 a month. ",
Dion,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I bought 16 of these and gave most of them out as Christmas presents. When I bought my first one in 2015 I was impressed with the questions I asked and the responses I received. These past 5 months or so I believe Alexia must have gone in for a lobotomy. Seldom understands the question. Upgraded to the Prime Music. For how large they say the music library is, I have it ask an average of 3 times before it sometimes plays the song I requested. Yes you can load all sorts of &#34;skills&#34; but they need to come up with a way to allow you to print or even e-mail the skills and commands to yourself. ",
william,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.    Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.    Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it. ",
"Chris Hockaday","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Biggest piece of junk ever. It worked great for 1 day. Then I unplugged it and plugged back in and it just spins with a blue light and is completely unresponsive, can't even reset the device.  I've googled everything I can think of to try but nothing works.  I get that stuff doesn't always work perfectly and has issues, but the biggest problem is that there is no customer support.  There is no phone number to call, or online tech support to help when your device isn't working properly.  I guess I'll throw it away. ",

StuE,"March 12, 2017 ",1.0,"I resisted buying any personal assistant until now. I don't have a 'connected home' and my entertainment system is on Google Player / Chromecast so it won't integrate with the Echo. So why 5 stars if I don't have even a few of the peripheral devices?    It costs $49.99 and I'm a Prime member - that's enough to make it worthwhile. &#34;Alexa, play 70s Rock Classics station&#34;. And for the next several hours I'm entertained.    Note to anyone in the digital advertising world: Echo uses Bing search and provides local results based on Yelp. All answers are also sent to the app on the smartphone paired to the Echo device. Geez, Bing? Yelp? Oh well, Echo can answer most questions...    Four years ago I was given a very good Vizio accessory speaker that worked with the iPad version 2. That iPad tanked last year and the newer Apple products don't use the larger USB connector so I thought the speaker was trash. Using the mini-pin output from Echo to the speaker I now have enough sound to fill the first floor of our house and reclaimed a speaker that would have been tossed to the curb. One advantage of the corded speaker connection - I don't have to re-do pairing ever, a common occurrence with any of my Bluetooth speakers.    I am looking for a white-light set of wi-fi enabled bulbs (boring, but useful) as a first step toward home automation.    I really want an Echo solution that can manage our TV with Hulu / Amazon / Netflix / Sling / YouTube. (Google Play would be a huge bonus. Because competitors). If I could replace the massive (and to some confusing) Harmony TV remote with voice commands life would be good. I can't find anyone who says they have successfully managed this set of tasks. Yes, the new Fire Stick is Alexa-enabled, but I'd prefer one listening device rather than two.    I considered the Google product and chose the Amazon Echo instead. While Google may have better search capabilities, I'm pretty well covered between phone and computers. I saw the Echo Dot as a low-cost entry point where I could salvage a good sounding compact speaker system AND dip my toe into home automation without spending a fortune. Next year? Who knows, but for right now the Echo Dot was exactly what I was looking for. ",
tonyb,"March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"This echo dot refuses to stay connected to Wi-Fi.  It initially connects without a problem. It works for short time, then it just stops.   I keep resetting it back to factory settings,  but it still does not connect.   I have had three echo's for quite a while and have never once had an issue with any of them.  This is the second dot have tried, and I have had the exact same issue with both of them. ",
TwistedTree,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Lasted just about 6 months, then started failing. We would give a command, and the dot would sit and think about answering. Stops in the middle of playing music. We ask it to turn off the lights using a wink hub, lights stay on and dot replies OK or the lights instantly go off, then the dot takes 2 to 3 minutes to respond OK. Ask it to tell us a joke, it tells the joke, but stops before giving the punch line. We have a full size echo that works fine, and we have tried moving the dot next to the echo to see if it was having issues with the wifi range, no change. Reset to factory defaults and setup from scratch, no change. We finally contacted tech support, who where useless. Bounced us around to 4 different techs in less then 5 minutes, where hung up on then finally told the case would be escalated to tier 2 support. All tier 2 support did was send an email telling us how to contact tech support again. Waste of time and money. ",

Artemaria,"March 9, 2017 ",1.0,"At first, I thought that this would just be like a voice-controlled Siri that is always on, but  after living with it for several months it seems as if it is so much more.  While not perfect, the speech recognition and accuracy are on a par with Google Assistant, and that accuracy along with the &#34;instant on&#34; feature is what makes this so easy to use.  The literature is not the clearest on this, but you don't really need a speaker for the Echo Dot, and we usually don't use it with the speaker, because the built in speaker is more than loud and clear enough for Alexa's speaking voice in the 20 x 16 room where we have it stationed.  If you want to play music and have the music sound rich and full, then you should hook it up to a nice Bluetooth speaker.  We use the Logitech Boom and it works very well, usually pairing flawlessly with the Echo Dot with very little effort, and great sound.    What makes the Echo Dot a little different and perhaps more fun to use than its competitors are the &#34;skills&#34; that are built into it.  I'm not going to go into the details of all the things that it can do because you can read about them on c/net or some other tech site, but what I will tell you is that there are alot of &#34;skills&#34; that are not at all pragmatic or useful, but that make the Echo Dot/Alexa alot more fun than the competition.  There's a storytelling feature, where Alexa will tell you a not so great bedtime story.  But what makes it so engaging are the thoughtfully interspersed comments in that story, such as &#34;no, you can't get any water,&#34; and &#34;that's your last story, and its time for you to go to sleep,&#34; which seem so human and so clever.  The Echo Dot/Alexa also will tell you the news, the weather and instantaneously provide any other current-events related information that you may want to hear while cooking dinner or getting dressed for work.    Along, these same lines, Alexa will tell you a joke, and will answer questions about various topics including about other AI platforms which she does in a polite and diplomatic fashion with a response like &#34;I like all AIs.&#34;  In reality, however, this is not true.  Neither Alexa, nor Google Assistant, nor Siri are true AIs.  They are merely the latest in voice recognition hardware and software that, through brute force algorithm calculations performed on a server far from your home, determines a high-probability acceptable response to the combination of words that served as its verbal input.  Because Alexa is cannot make any decisions on its own, it is not a true AI.  Thus, if your internet service is slow or off, Alexa will not work, leaving you with a $50 paperweight.  We've not had that issue, but it is something to consider if your internet service is not the best and you are considering buying this device.    In the end, this is a fun foray in to the world of voice-activated assistants.  And while Amazon's database of verbal input grows, paving the way for a true AI someday, Alexa may be the recognized as one of the first pioneering digital assistant devices that trained people to verbally interact with technology in their home.

NC-Ron,"March 27, 2017 ",1.0,"My wife and I had thought about getting Dots for the grand kids for Christmas but the reviews at that time were incomplete and confusing about what the dot would do and how they might interact/interfere with each other in the same household.  Well, we now own an Echo, a Tap and two Dots. They are all great.    Myth 1.  You do NOT need Echo to use a Dot. Dot is autonomous. It responds to Alexa commands just like Echo, and can control remote devices just as well.    Myth 2. You MUST have external speakers. Not so. The speaker in Dot is no great shakes, but it works. The audio output to a good set of powered speakers is great.    Myth 3. If you use Echo, or Dot or Tap, you cannot have two or more doing different things. Not so. I can have Alexa via Echo playing Clapton in the living room and have Alexa via Dot playing the Dead in the bedroom, at the same time, with just one Amazon Prime account, not even the Prime Music account.    Other:  Both Dot and Echo have to be plugged into 115 v all the time to work. The Tap is rechargeable and bluetooth so it is portable. Great feature. We use Echo and Dot to control TP-Link smart plugs and smart switches. They work great. (I love the TP-Link stuff, maybe another review. But Alexa at my house can control the smart stuff at our beach place 250 miles away. In fact you have to be precise in your language with Alexa or she'll be turning stuff on and off in the other location...)    I actually haven't tried the Tap yet with remotes (it's at the beach and I'm not), but I assume it will work just as well. The only caveat is that you have to 'enable remote' on the smart plugs, etc. in order to have Alexa turn them on and off. Some folks are leery about doing that. If I get hacked and some clown wants to turn off my bedroom light, so be it. (I can monitor the status of all the smart devices with the KASA app for TP-Link and my smart phone.)    Dot is a little bigger than a hockey puck and makes a great alarm clock. ",
ComputerGuy,"April 26, 2017 ",5.0,"For $50 and what it does, how can you go wrong? Answer is, you can't. This thing is awesome. Not a whole lot bigger than a hockey puck. With all the power of the Full Sized Echo less the better speaker. Since you can pair with a Blue Tooth Speaker or plug it in via cable which the full unit currently doesn't, there's really no downside to this thing. Setup in minutes, new skills easily added. 2 Million songs available if you have Amazon Prime. I've got it controlling a Smart LED Bulb I purchased a few days after I received the Echo Dot. I purchased a second one for my brother who's Bed Ridden in a care facility and he loves it. He's a Trivia and Facts Buff so he went to town using it to search Wikipedia for all sorts of info. He's also using it to play his favorite Radio Station.    If you are interested in this device, ignore the low rating reviews. The speaker is fine, yes it's small and not super powerful but there is no quality issue with it. It's like using a small portable radio (not a boombox). If you're an Audiophile or need loud music, hook it up to a stereo or high end Bluetooth speaker, don't trash it because it won't shake your windows with the built in speaker.    It's sound pickup is fine as well. I put one upstairs in my house and it can hear me from other rooms upstairs just fine. Unless you are talking like a mouse or have it blasting music or something making it hard for it to pickup your voice. I purchased a second for my downstairs part of the house and with it centrally located, I've got the entire house covered with 2 and it's always within range of my voice. My Girlfriend has a slight speech issue and it understands her fine too.    I may buy a 3rd to dedicate to my Home Entertainment center and plug it into the stereo. I should have purchased 3 with the promotion of getting $20 for buying 3, but I wanted to test one out first. In any case, even without the Buy 3 promotion, you still come in under the $176 for the Full echo. I don't have the full Echo so I can't compare, but from everything I've read, and what i've experienced with my Dots, I see nothing wrong with them and feel they are a major margin. And I don't feel the need to get the full unit at this point just to have a better speaker. ",
Ken,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I haven't had a chance to play with &#34;Alexa&#34; that much.  I'll ask her what the time is just to keep her awake.  My wife thinks that is silly.  I'll ask her to Wikipedia technical items, and she is ready to tell me all.  I of course got her her own leather jacket, and so far have introduced her to the WiFi thermostat.  It was cold in the house this morning, so I asked her to set the THERMOSTAT to 69.  She did it, and that one degree made my morning.  Of course I had her set it back.  I was watching a documentary on Netflix, and one of the people in the show was named Alexi.  That was close enough for Alexa, even though said by the TV.    I've added a Z wave hub and will add some 3-way WiFi switches, and be able to have Alexa turn lights on and off by voice command.  Someone needs to write a book on all the possible ways to do this.

"Joey Espinosa","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"THE GOOD:  Lots of &#34;Skills&#34; (which you can think of as apps) that enable the Echo to do various other things. You can even build your own (if you're willing to write some code) and give the Echo a whole range of new features. There are some great Skills already out there. For instance, if you use OurGroceries on your phones to track your grocery list, you can enable a Skill that links that to the Echo, so you can say &#34;Alexa, tell OurGroceries to add eggs to the Food List.&#34; And Alexa will do just that.    Additionally, there are built-in features that are pretty good and up to date. I kept asking Alexa what the score was during the Super Bowl, and it knew almost right away when the score had changed.    THE BAD:  The Echo's ability to understand is very limited. It can comprehend some range of questions with certain key words, but it cannot understand context one bit. You can't ask &#34;What movie won Best Picture at the Oscars?&#34; and then follow up with &#34;Who directed it?&#34; You'll get the answer to the first one, but the second will result with the &#34;Sorry, I don't understand&#34; response that Echo owners know OH SO WELL.    Specifically with the Dot, the speaker is not great. I can understand, since it's so cheap ($50), but it's really not great. I keep a Dot in the kitchen (because it's useful there with timers and such), and I can barely hear it about 20 feet away in the living room when watching TV, even at full volume.    THE UGLY:  &#34;Alexa, stop.&#34; &#34;Alexa, stop!&#34; &#34;ALEXA, STOP!!!&#34;  If you're an Echo owner, I'm sure you've run into this. When the timer alarm goes off, or the Echo inexplicably begins doing something because it thought it heard its trigger, or it misunderstands what you wanted and begins playing a sample of some music you did not ask for... and you can do nothing to shut it off, even without background noise! It will just keep going until you find yourself with your face 6 inches from a tiny hockey puck-shaped device yelling at the top of your lungs, pleading with it to end the suffering already and STOP.    No, &#34;Okay, Google&#34; is not as mellifluous as &#34;Alexa&#34;. But I'll tell you what it's also not: COMMON. &#34;Makes&#34;, &#34;treks&#34;, &#34;plex&#34;, &#34;fix a&#34;, even the word &#34;breakfast&#34;, they can all sound like &#34;Alexa&#34;. We've gotten so used to Alexa providing her own commentary at random times throughout the day that we've accepted it as our newfound peanut gallery. Sometimes it's actually funny, but it is never helpful. That super annoying 2 Broke Girls commercial (I hate that show) where she walks in and thinks she's burned 500 calories but then she realizes it's actually the time on her watch (I mean come on, writers)? Yep, Alexa responds like clockwork with the current time. The ironic part is that Alexa can apparently hear the TV perfectly fine, but I can barely hear Alexa from the room where the TV is in. I can't imagine anybody having this thing near a television and NOT changing the trigger word from &#34;Alexa&#34; to something else.    And if you try to say what's in the title of this review (&#34;Alexa, order me a Google Home&#34;), Alexa will tell you she can't. I'd consider it a funny joke from the folks at Amazon, but considering what I've seen so far, it's more likely just incapable. ",
"Amazon Customer","February 3, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought one for Christmas than I got one for a present, I thought that if you had prime you where good on music I was wrong you have to pay 4 bucks a month and it does not mean you can listen to full songs on all your echo dots , Nope only one. Its 4 dollars for each one. I started to realize Amazon is pinching for every dime I got. 100 bucks for prime and than more for music. I am over Amazon. I got a Google home and I like it more it throws YouTube videos to my TV. I already had the family music plan that comes with YouTube red. Also google music is the best music service. I can find anything I want to here that Spotify or Amazon does not have. The echo works but it reminds me of Xbox vs PlayStation the xbox you have to pay more for what already come with the PlayStation. The home gives you 6 month free of service also. Echo works but you have to keep feeding it money. The google home works better with Android phones also. the home is still growing because it just came out but I think it will surpass the echo in a year. Now I have to see if someone will buy these from me because I don't want them anymore. One last thing the google works better with my hue lights. Ok google show me a video of someone smashing the echo dot on my TV. ",
SEvans,"March 1, 2017 ",3.0,"I got the echo dot 2nd Generation for myself for Christmas. Hubby kept saying no they has a bad reputation for not working. But I am an electronic nut and love amazon's  ideas when it comes to this kind of thing. So out of the box it is an adapter and the plug of course as well as the dot. Mind you I was thinking about the bigger Echo, but I know I made the right choice as I wanted something smaller that would not have a chance of being knocked over by my dogs. Well for the past few days I have been trying out different apps regardless of their rating to see what we can do together. I am very impressed Echo hears what I say and does it instantly. I have listened to music and had her read to me from my kindle books list. I am on my way to having my life so much easier as I am now looking at doing a smart home set up and getting a second one to just keep in the kitchen for the todo list and grocery lists, weather reports and everything else I can think of. While the other stays at bedside for sleep music, reading and some meditations as well as an alarm. I have yet to get the hubby to talk to echo to add groceries to the list but he will in time as he sees everything that it can do. I was able to set up my calendar right from the start. I do hope that they soon ad a reminder that I can just ask what I need to know or reminders for my husband. ",
Jeff,"January 24, 2017 ",2.0,"Very cool tech but feels like its still in its infancy. And has one fatal flaw if you plan to use primarily for music playback as we did.    The voice recognition is neat and works some of the time but often fails to understand and really struggles to recognize playlist names. It also often can't hear over its own playback (even with significant speaker separation), resulting in my wife or daughter yelling at Alexa. Tech fail. Especially problematic with guests over. So we increasingly use the app to control playback. The app is ok but not great compared to sonos or squeezebox alternatives.    We've connected to a small bluetooth speaker which sounds surprisingly good. But lacks bass. Unfortunately there is no easy way to add a sub connection without adding a stereo amp. Which we did and it sounds much better.    Now for the fatal flaw. We have three dots spread throughout the house. Each connected to their own speakers. We were hoping to setup as an alternative to sonos. And Logitechs now defunct squeezebox (what we had prior). We paid for premium music plan and uploaded our entire library. Only problem is amazon won't let you playback different music from your own library to different dots at the same time. Really!? And no way to connect to local source/server like sonos or squeezebox.    Looks like we'll end up with Sonos after all. ",

Blade56989,"April 21, 2017 ",3.0,"Its a great product, but it still has a way to go before it meets my needs. I primarily got it to help me be more organized, and to make agenda management easier. While calendar scheduling can be a bit tricky, its not to hard once you get the hang of it. The main issue with it writing down the wrong thing because you didn't say it clearly enough.    But what I also really wanted was for Alexa to able to read different lists to me when I asked.    The thing that bugs me is the pairing &#34;List&#34; apps, its SOOO STUPID how it does this. Basically it pairs with apps that you make dedicated lists on, and since Alexa comes restricted with 2 lists &#34;Shopping list&#34; and &#34;To Do List&#34;, you'd think it would be able to have Alexa read and manage those lists on the paired apps. But NO, it just allows the apps to manage the only 2 lists Alexa has!  The reason this is so stupid, is that the dedicated &#34;Alexa app&#34;, that you need to have on your phone for the Echo anyways, already has a list manager for those 2 lists! So I got the Any.do app (list app) for nothing, since Alexa cant actually interact with it. So the &#34;morning routine&#34; and &#34;Exercise Routine&#34; lists I was making on Any.do, cant be read by Alexa.

"D. Coral","December 20, 2016 ",5.0,"It's hard to tell how you're actually going to use this until you try it!    Before I received the Echo Dot 2, I thought maybe I would use it for quick research like &#34;tell me about antheraxanthin supplements&#34; -- but I'm not using it like that because I haven't figured out the right way to say the phrases so she understands what I'm seeking.    Instead, I find the Echo to be super useful as a helping hand for daily routines: change the thermostat temperature, turn on and off the lights, tell me what time it is, set the alarm clock for the next morning, tell me the fastest route to avoid traffic, and especially to play music.    As a former musician I'm picky about speakers so I did a lot of research on the best sounding bluetooth speaker under $200.  I ended up purchasing the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3.  The Bose Soundlink III also has amazing sound quality but unfortunately the Soundlink III switches off 30 minutes after no longer detecting a sound signal, so it's not practical to use the Soundlink III with Echo.    The Bose SoundTouch 10 is also a popular speaker for use with Echo Dot, but you can get the better sounding Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3 for even less, available in both black and white.    What really impressed me about Echo Dot 2 is that it wakes up even when I'm saying &#34;Alexa&#34; softly way across from the other side of the house.    The only thing that bugs me is that I wish there was a better way to say home automation commands.  Alexa uses the phrase &#34;turn on&#34; for just about every home device (except for thermostats, which have additional commands).  So I would say &#34;turn on open window shades&#34; instead of simply being able to say &#34;open window shades.&#34;  Alexa would be greatly improved if a user could add custom phrases that map to an automation command.    But it's still a lot better than Google Home because for that product you have to say &#34;OK, Google&#34; to wake up, which is totally awkward to say all the time.  Amazon is much better at naming things -- Using &#34;Alexa&#34; as the wakeup command is pleasant to say.    Two cute things to try with Alexa:    &#34;Alexa, do you like green eggs and ham?&#34;    &#34;Alexa, tell me the truth.&#34; ",
"L. Snow","April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"I've spent and lot of time trying to fix problems with the Google Chromecast/Home, and I am amazed at how those problems go away playing Spotify on an Amazon Echo Dot instead.    I want to run Spotify on my home, whole-house stereo, which I also use to play the radio or even cds and lps, anytime or all the time on any day.  Chromecast (now Google Home) isn't really meant to do that.  It wants to receive a &#34;cast&#34; signal from another device, and only for a certain time.  If you remove or close that device, Cast/Home goes into a weird kind of limbo state that may keep playing Spotify for a while but locks out control.  Even if you leave a dedicated device like a phone in place, it still times out and locks up.  I've had it crash like this several times a day, in the middle of a song.  The only solution is to close both Spotify and Home completely from the device and start over.    But the Echo isn't receiving a cast, it is casting itself.  It is always on.  It always appears in my list of Spotify devices.  I can always engage it from any device using Spotify Connect.  It doesn't turn off after a certain time.  And it doesn't crash.    Also, the Google Cast/Home crashes when I use my microwave.  Echo Dot doesn't do that.    Echo Dots do not coordinate.  So if you want to control you whole house system from a place where you can't speak to Alexa, you have to use an app on a phone or other device (Spotify, Alexa, and/or your stereo's app).  Or you can buy a Voice Remote for the Echo, which is apparently bluetooth but works over ridiculously long distance, basically my whole place.    In short, the Echo Dot works with Spotify and my home stereo like I thought Google Home would do but doesn't.  It costs about the same and it saves me a ton of headaches.  It makes Spotify really great in my home. ",
"Patrick Glose","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I'm sure there isn't much to say that has not already been said, but I did want to give koodo's to the developers of this device.  My home already has nice sound, the price of the echo was just not in my electronics budget at this time.  I was very excited when I found the Dot, and for the price, I had to give it a go.  I've only had it for about a week now, but we love it (her).  Many Easter eggs built in, and just asking her to play a song, a group, or genre and have her do it is delightful.  Right now, she's hooked up to my Denon through a 3.5mm jack, but the Denon doesn't offer bluetooth.  I'm working on adding a bluetooth HDMI adapter.  As for automation, I am a bit of a tinkerer when it comes to gadget and cool stuff, so I went on several hunts when Alexa arrived to our home.  From what I can tell, if you're looking to automate (lights, thermostat, etc), you will most likely need a hub.  At first, I thought I'd need several hubs to support different manufacturers devices.  Seemingly, not so.  The Samsung SmartThings hub ($50 on Amazon right now) not only has support for most device manufacturers, but also has (and the coolest part for me) open source platform (Amazon also has open source).  What this means is, like Android, anyone can develop &#34;skills&#34; (Amazons name for an app or program).  The market is going to flood with new skills and devices from people like me who love building tech.  So, like I said, there probably isn't much I can say about the Dot that hasn't been said, but there is much to be said for the Alexa environment.  p.s., the microphones (7 of them) are amazing.  She can hear me from a good distance. ",
"Andrew J. Good","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have 2 Echo Dots and a Echo.  The echo makes a great music device, the echo dot is a nice extension for my smart home and is still great for stuff like getting my news in the morning.  Alone I would say an echo is a great device, with several smart home devices it's even better.  With 3 echos around my house sometimes two will pick up the wake word at the same time.  This has caused issues and I would rather not change the wake word as it could confuse others in the house.  With that said it's normally minor and not a big deal.    How much my echo dots do could be best summarized with my normal day:    Wake up in the morning/afternoon because of my work schedule I keep my room quite devoid of sunlight.  &#34;Alexa turn on bedroom&#34; Without getting to bed or having an annoying bedside light my room's light turns on thanks to a hue bridge/light bulb and Alexa being able to control hue lights.  &#34;Alexa what's the news&#34; and now I get my customizable flash briefing while I'm getting out of bed.  Walk out of the room saying &#34;Alexa turn off bedroom&#34; no need for a poorly positioned light switch to flick off.    While I'm making food &#34;Alexa, play my main playlist&#34; and I can listen to music without having to worry about turning on a device.  As the food gets done &#34;Alexa, turn on TV&#34; and &#34;Alexa, stop&#34; music turns off and my harmony hub turns on my TV.  By the time I get there it's ready for me to use and I can play TV.  Getting ready for work while watching TV, ready to leave don't want to grab the remote &#34;Alexa, turn off TV&#34; done.  Get home it's all dark &#34;Alexa, turn on living room&#34;.    There are a lot of badly positioned light switches in the house, needing less remotes and in some cases Harmony/Alexa being able to do things quicker is always a good thing.  I have 3 different areas in my room where I might switch and carrying at any time 2-3 remotes around is a pain.  Being able to play music on voice command is great along with being able to turn it off.  Alexa can also be used remotely with my fire tablet and my Fire TV also supports Alexa.  Alexa can also tell jokes and do other things that can also make it a great thing for friends to try to do.  I can even ask Alexa for the movie list of my local theater and ask her about a given movie for more information.  All without having to get up and check my computer or my phone/tablet.    It's not all great though, She makes mistakes, she can't hear to well over loud music including her own and multiple people talking in the background causes mistakes to happen.  Once in a while she'll even respond to the TV randomly even when the TV doesn't say Alexa.  The most annoying thing about echo is that without a Wifi connection it can do almost nothing. ",
"H. Salsano","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"This was our first Echo Dot, and we love her.  Although, not sure she always loves us, as sometimes she doesn't even answer us.  She seems to have a hearing deficiency.  We do have to speak loud and clear for her to even hear us, and especially if we want her to actually understand us.  The problem is mostly when she is playing music or the TV is on.  Of course, she can hear everyone on the TV just fine and respond to all the Alexa commercials.  Good think I have the purchasing PIN set up so only I can order things!  I like listening to the news feeds from Cnet, NPR and the weather.  I like controlling the TV, AV system and lights through her.  I add items to the Our Groceries android app through her, and she usually gets it right.  I use the timer and alarm functions often, especially when my 2 other kitchen timers are already running for other things.  I can tell her to &#34;Turn on Amazon Music&#34; which turns on the stereo and selects Aux, turns on the Amazon Basics Bluetooth receiver, and then I tell her what to play and it comes through the stereo.  I can even listen to kindle books and such this way for more volume.  Love the pause and resume, in case the phone rings.  For music, I tell her to Skip this song when something awful come on .  As time goes on, I find more useful things.  I am now looking at a new skill to alert friends if there is an emergency, called Ask My Buddy, which sounds useful for when one of us is home alone and something happens. ",
"Gadgit Tech","April 24, 2017 ",5.0,"First thoughts, Echo Dot was easy to setup with either a smart phone or computer.  I switched to the computer as it was just easier on the eyes.  Good voice control once you get the hang of it and the method used for commands.    Echo Dot is small and easy to place in a location where one unit can cover a large area.  Integration with a current home automation system was simple using the skills already available and well document between both Amazon and my HA system (in my case HomeSeer).    Con's so far: NO 24 hour clock? I hate having to say, hear or read AM and PM, and the Echo Dot does not support this yet!    I got this to use with my current home automation system due to other devices (hardware failures) having an issues!  I impressed by the simple commands (VR) that allow me to be hands free to operate my lights and systems and the other Echo functions are a plus such as checking news, traffic and playing my own library of music.    The Echo has so many skills sets already available that it will take some time before I discover what all it can do besides what I have already tried, but for 50 dollars I can see using the Echo Dot rather than replace or install other HA devices that need to be replaced or installed due manufacture defect and or failure in my system, I can save on deployment and cost of those devices as well. So I might end up with some HA spares, which is always a good thing.    Note: If you happen to use HomeSeer HA you will need version HS3, HSTouch-with account and also make certain HS3 setup under the network page - remote control settings is CHECKED for JSOM. It took me a bit to figure out that this needed to be checked for remote access for this to work.

GLS,"March 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Well I was really pissed at Amazon because they dropped the ball on hitting their two day Prime delivery (because they've gone to “shipping partners” who don't care). I'd ordered this Echo Dot for a friend who can't see, and wanted to help him manage his Pandora music using voice commands. It arrived this afternoon, I hooked it up to my own Pandora account and I'm thunderstruck. What an absolutely beautiful integration of speech input and a great adaptive online music app. As I write this I'm listening to a Pandora station I defined a couple of years ago, “Chigago Radio” named for that great group, Chicago. The music is streaming through the little speaker built into the Dot (it really isn't all that bad in terms of fidelity, though for regular listening I'll normally patch it into my hi-fi system) and as I write and let my station wash over me, I occasionally pause and say “Alexa, thumbs up” or “Alexa, thumbs down” to steer Pandora's adaptive programming in the right direction. She responds “sure...rating saved”. What's amazing is that I know I haven't provided this much input since I created the station two years ago as I have over the past twenty minutes. This has been totally effortless, as the Alexa and Pandora apps are joined at the hip online – I don't even know where my smart TV or Roku remotes are at the moment, I just speak and it happens. Wow! I can't even imagine how my blind friend (a former musician) is going to feel about being able to do this. I just ordered a Dot for myself, because it's that cool. Amazon, you are totally forgiven for the late delivery; you've hit a grand slam with this device! And Alexa, I would love to speak to you privately. You have won my heart, honey ;-) Whew.... ",
Kathy,"December 8, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought an Echo last week and loved it so much that I had to have a Dot for our bedroom.  The first thing that impressed me was the quality of the sound. I had planned on using an external speaker with it, but there is no need for it at all. I'm able to have the sounds nice and low when I'm listening in bed and can turn it up and hear it all the way in my bathroom which is approx. 16 feet away.  The sound is great.  It's not the rich sound that is with the Echo, but it's definitely very good. I used the same app that I had downloaded when I set up my Echo to set up my Dot and it couldn't have been easier. I just plugged it in, connected it to our wifi and then continued with the set up on my app. I'm sure it took less than 5 minutes.    As with the Echo, my favorite things to use the Dot for are listening to music and having it read my Kindle books to me.  I love Audible, but don't always purchase audio books, so it's so nice to just say &#34;Alexa read (whichever book I'm reading)&#34; After I tell it to read my book, I say &#34;set sleep timer for 15 minutes&#34; and it will shut right off. Last night I had trouble falling asleep and I asked it to play music to help me sleep and I heard a selection of relaxing nature sounds.  Then, in the morning I can have it turn on an AM station I like, so I can listen to that while I'm getting ready for the day. I know I can do all of these things on my cell phone, but it's so nice to just be in the middle of whatever I'm doing and just say outloud what I want to hear without having to pick something up.    I'm sure I'll find other uses that I like for the Dot, but for now I'm just thrilled to have it read to me or play music. And I can't emphasize enough how good the sound quality is. If you are thinking about buying a speaker to go with it, I'd wait to get it home and make sure you really need one. Unless you are using this in a very big room, chances are you won't. ",
"🌈 KT","April 10, 2017 ",5.0,"We're still getting used to it, of course, but I'll start with our initial experience.    &#62; It was easy to hook up, which is always a plus.  &#62; It doesn't integrate with the Amazon site as much as I had hoped.  For example, I can't ask Alexa to tell me what was in my last online order.  I'm pretty forgetful so that's one thing I was looking for. (part of why I took a star off)  &#62; The Alexa special deals is pretty awkward.  There are many, but she'll only list 2 at a time, then tells me to go online.  Granted, I would not want to sit there listening to the long hand version of each item (She doesn't just say the item, but a description plus price plus discount and then asks after each one if you want to order it), but I would like a way to customize how she presents the list to me, and then I'd also rather not be told to go online and see the rest.  I'd have looked there already if I wanted to do that. (Another part of why I took a star off)  &#62; She's not as smart as I'd hoped, either.  I have to learn how she wants to hear things, instead of her learning how I phrase things.  As in, I have to know her keywords to get her to tell me anything. (Another part to the -1 star)  &#62; My husband's a writer so I put one in the bedroom for when he wakes up with an idea.  It's been very useful for him to just tell Alexa to make a note - no lights on, no concentrating on what you're writing, no great interruption to my sleep.  &#62; It also functions as an alarm clock (you can pick from various tones through the phone app - why can't you ask Alexa to demo them for you??).  I hooked the Dot up to a bluetooth speaker for the purpose (you can also set the alarm volume (thru the app) which will be different than the normal volume you keep it at for speaking). This is good because we don't have set times to get up, so I'm constantly forgetting to set the alarm before I collapse in bed.  &#62; The special Alexa deals are sometimes quite useful.  I've gotten a couple of toys for my twin niece/nephew, and caught a nice sale on an APC battery backup.    I'm good about updating if anything comes up, but I'll certainly update as we learn and grow with it, too.  Any questions, feel free to comment or email and I'll try to help. ",
Ms1,"November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I would just like to say that this toy started off being remarkable. Linked with my smart home devices and unlimited music this truly was the ultimate (blow your friends away) party trick.  An item of convenience, and much of a necessity in today's busy world.    Then it surely became half effective....     The problem with these devices  is they lack any sort of self improvemet. Instead it seems technology takes the &#34;I'm outdated, please replace me!&#34; approach.  That's the real problem with tech these days, it all needs to be physically replaced.  It has a Shelf life, like something you'd put in your fridge . Manufacturers shudder with excitement being about to build items with a short life span.  When instead we are ready for self awareness from our tech. Technology and software that is able to maintain its self.  Bring forth the new age. Because, humans are not the only future.... ",
W.,"December 12, 2016 ",4.0,"I love this. It is small and easy to use. I love the easter eggs like the star trek prases and results.    It is very customizable to your needs by enabling the available skills on the app. I can use it to order pizza, ask about the weather and traffic, ask it to brief me on the latest news, and it has games like choose your own adventure. I dont think I will be using it to buy anything. Also I do not have smart home items like the phillips hue lights but will probably get some. I like the idea that I can tell it to contol the electronics in the house.    I dont have bluetooth speakers but it still was able to hook up to my old logitech speaker system with a cable. I plan on eventually comnecting it to my fire stick to control the TV.    It is discreet and functions well. The only downside is for reminders it will only add to a to do list or tell you what you already have on your google calendar. If you want it to tell you agendas on other calendars, you have to import them to your google calendar as it will only use a google calendar. Also alarms can only be set within 24 hours.    For the price it is great. It is in my opinion better than the original echo as it is more versatile. It seems to be the gift of the season as most of my family members, including myself, gave them as gifts.    It is fun to bond with others who have them. For example, my dad also got one and is a huge star trek fan. I told him about the star trek easter eggs and he loved that alexa calls him the captain when he asks it to go to warp speed. ",
Gadgeteer,"November 10, 2016 ",2.0,"This is an amazing little device at a very affordable price. The setup was very straight forward. I had it up and running in a matter of a few minutes. It just needed to connect to my wireless network and away it went. I also found that Alexa can control Insteon and Phillips Hue lighting. So I've added the Insteon Skill to Alexa through the Alexa iPad app and I now have voice control over my home lighting and furnace. There are so many skills you can add to Alexa and new ones show up on a daily basis. Alexa can also control the Next (and other) smart furnace thermostats by adding the &#34;Nest&#34; skill. I can change the thermostat from anywhere in the house I have an Echo Dot in voice range. So setting my thermostat now is a simple voice command &#34;Alexa. Set Nest to 70 degrees.&#34; and she says OK and does it.  It can also pair with most any Bluetooth speakers. So I have the Echo dot streaming radio stations to a Bluetooth speaker. Controlling the volume is a simple as &#34;Alexa. Turn it down.&#34; or &#34;Alexa. Turn it off.&#34; Super cool!    I really don't think most people understand how powerful and easy to use this device is. You can ask it anything you might search for on the Internet using Google or Bing. You can also set up an alarm clock function to wake you. The only word of caution is to be sure to set up a security code in the Alexa app when ordering anything off the Internet. Otherwise, anyone within voice range can order anything on the Internet without having to provide a security code. ",
Gary,"December 18, 2016 ",5.0,"I can't believe I ever lived without these.  I put one in my Media Room and one in my Master Bath.  In addition to the incredible music access, and all the instant information access, the Echo Dot links both to my Samsung SmartThings and Logitech Harmony Ultimate systems.  So using Alexa, I can control my lights, my ceiling fans, and my entire media center.  Relative to music access, I have found that the free access Amazon music didn't include some of the music I liked.  So I upgraded to the Amazon Unlimited Music service for just one Echo Dot ($3.99/month).  If you want that access on multiple Echo Dots, the Unlimited Music service is $7.99/month. One limitation I have noticed: bluetooth connectivity is problematic.  The Echo Dot will nicely be playing music through my a/v receiver's bluetooth, and will suddenly lose the connection.  In addition, every time you use the Echo, you have to tell the Echo to connect to bluetooth.  I am able to connect both my Dots to my a/v receiver, and my stand-alone  bathroom speaker using a 3.5mm - RCA plug and a 3.5mm - 3.5mm cable respectively.  The hard-wire connection is a lot more reliable. The Echo Dot's internal speaker is fine for non-music use, but is pretty limited for music.  With only two limitations, I can't think of a better electronic toy!  Buy it, you'll love it! ",
soulife,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This friggin thing is so cool. I couldn't justify spending $150 on one, but now that they offer a $50 version that's more streamlined, it was hard to turn down. So when Amazon had their $9 bigthanks sale, I couldn't say no for only $41..    If you're just getting started, or are thinking about starting, and don't want to spend a fortune on smart bulbs and wall sockets, if you're a little tech savvy,  the Rf remote light bulb sockets cost about $20 for 3, and Rf remote wall sockets cost $30 for 5. Then what you need is a &#34;broadlink rm pro 2,or rm2&#34; which isn't more than $40 depending on where you buy.. Then do some googling &#34;Amazon broadlink rm2&#34; and you'll see how to control anything ir and Rf controlled using on off commands. Which isn't full blown smart bulbs, but it's great for saving money when dimming and changing colors isn't needed..    My only problem so far is you can't use &#34;and&#34;  commands, like Google home can. For example, &#34;alexa, turn on kitchen AND living room lights&#34; won't work. You have to say &#34;alexa, living room lights.. Alexa, kitchen lights.&#34; which annoys the crap out of me and everyone listening.    But overall, I'm controlling 3 bulbs, 5 wall sockets, and my TV and Xbox, for less than the cost of the big echo, which imho is pretty cool. Not to mention all the other stuff it can do ",
"K. Ortega","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I'm in love with Dot.  I got this instead of the large system for two reasons, first because I have a Bose portable speaker and because I didn't know how often I'd use Alexa. Now I'm either going to buy another Dot for my bedroom or fork out the money for the full sized Echo.  The reason for that is my Bose speaker sleeps, so if I ask Alexa a question I don't always hear the answer. I either end up disconnecting Dot from the speaker or have to wake my speaker. Not always convenient. Alexa has been fun and we all love her.  No having to teach her to recognize our voices. She works out of the box once connected to the wifi. She's revolutionized my shopping lists alone. Instead of writing it down or punching it into my phone, I simply ask her to add something to my list and it then shows up in the Alexa app on my phone. Now my kids tell her what to add and we're all on point. I've connected my calendar to her and she tells me what's going on. I love the news briefs and we play jeopardy every day.  I can't wait to utilize her other features, but we're off to a good start.    The sound on the Dot isn't perfect for a full time music speaker but if you're in a small space it's not bad. If you want better quality opt for the full sized. But this is budget friendly and perfect to move from room to room. ",
ultra55371d,"March 11, 2017 ",5.0,"I am really liking this device so far.  Ever since the echo came out a couple of years ago, I wanted one, but it was just a little too expensive to experiment with.  With the lower cost of the Dot, the option to use a better speaker system and all the benefits of the full size Echo, this was a easy purchase.    I purchased the kit deal with the Phillips Hue Bridge and lights.  In addition, I purchased another 2 Phillips Hue bulbs and a Wemo smart plug.  the setup and installation of everything was very simple and didn't take long at all.  It is now very convenient to control the lighting in our our room and bathroom now.  The hardest thing to remember is not to use the switches anymore.    Another advantage the Dot has over the Echo is the ability to use a better speaker system.  I hooked ours up to a Logictech Z623 2.1 speaker system and it sounds beyond awesome.  I have both a Prime membership and a Spotify account.  Listening to Spotify now is very enjoyable.    There is a little learning curve on how to speak to the Dot, but we're all getting the hang of it.  I will be adding more Dots and other home automation devices to my home in the near future.  So far this has been a great experience and wonderful product.  I almost purchased the new Google Voice, but very happy I didn't since initial reviews are not that great and it sounds like they released it a bit too soon.  The Echo / Dot program has been around for years, has many partners and the possibilities are almost endless with these devices.  Very happy camper! ",
Missy,"April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"I am really not sure how I lived without Alexa prior to this little dot...............it is my music, my alarm, my fitness instructor, you name it...she does it.  Super impressed with the sound for such a little speaker.  Got one for my parents, they love it & already purchased another for the other end of their house.  I have a Bluetooth speaker hooked up to mine & can play music in the garage while the dot is at the other end of the house.  What voodoo magic is this????  Also have a few light bulbs that she can control & yelling out orders for that is AWESOME!!!  You can even name your bulbs whatever you want (mine are Thaddeus &  Bobby).  When I first got it, it disconnected frequently.  Almost sent it back a couple of times.  But upon further investigation.........my router was about a million years old.......upgraded that & she works perfectly!  So quick note....if you have disconnect issues with your dot, make sure your internet router or modem isn't to blame because I'm telling you..........YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE!!!  Also.....remember it is Alexa....NOT.......Alexis........yeah, I did that for awhile.......like an idiot.  Oh.....one more thing...I have a THICK, THICK southern accent & she understands me much better than humans do!  No lie. ",

If you can't remember the name of a song, you can say, &#34;Alexa, what's the name of the song that says, 'She was dancing down the street with her suede-blue eyes. . .&#34; and Alexa will find it and play it. Alexa get's smarter the more you use her.

Get up, get ready for work and ask her for the weather.  You've got it.  Now you don't have to look at the morning TV host who are all giddy in the morning while you're trying to wake up.  Alexa, give me the news.  Sit down, drink your coffee and listen to the news sources you've selected.  Short on coffee?  Alexa add coffee to my list.

TwistedTree,"March 14, 2017 ",5.0,"Lasted just about 6 months, then started failing. We would give a command, and the dot would sit and think about answering. Stops in the middle of playing music. We ask it to turn off the lights using a wink hub, lights stay on and dot replies OK or the lights instantly go off, then the dot takes 2 to 3 minutes to respond OK. Ask it to tell us a joke, it tells the joke, but stops before giving the punch line. We have a full size echo that works fine, and we have tried moving the dot next to the echo to see if it was having issues with the wifi range, no change. Reset to factory defaults and setup from scratch, no change. We finally contacted tech support, who where useless. Bounced us around to 4 different techs in less then 5 minutes, where hung up on then finally told the case would be escalated to tier 2 support. All tier 2 support did was send an email telling us how to contact tech support again. Waste of time and money. ",
"Amazon Customer","February 16, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought two Echo Dots hoping they would work with all my smart-technology.  I have a Wink Hub, Phillips Hue light bulbs and hub, smart plugs, UEboom wireless speaker and Nest thermostat.  You do not need an Echo (the really expensive tall one with the nice speaker in it) to operate your smart-technology using Alexa.  The Echo Dots can do all the same things.  It's awesome being able to have Alexa turn on/off lights, thermostat, connect to wireless speaker, etc.  It's LEGIT!    One thing to keep in mind: when one echo dot connects to a Bluetooth item such as UEboom and then later you are talking to the 2nd echo dot, Alexa will not be able to pair to the UEboom until you ask the first Echo Dot to disconnect from your speaker.  We thought something was wrong and then realized that only one Echo Dot and be paired with a Bluetooth item at a time. ",
"Rik Conaghan","March 9, 2017 ",1.0,"My wife received one of these for Christmas, and even though i am a techie kind of guy, I had never really seen a use for these. Now fast forward to March, they seem to have multiplied, and I now have 5 of these creatures living in various rooms throughout the house (this is the issue part :-)) they have been far more useful than i would have thought.    We have one in the Kitchen, which serves not only as musical accompaniment to our culinary activities, but as a personal shopping assistant to help maintain the shopping list. It sits there, ever faithful, just waiting for me to pull a product from the cupboard, realize it is the last one, then either add it to the shopping list we use to go to the store, or to go ahead and order it directly from Amazon. You really can't get much more convenient than that, especially as our minds aren't quite as sharp as they used to be (well we do have 2 young kids....)    We have three more in the bedrooms, they are used for playing music (built in speaker is more than adequate for our daughters audio needs, plus they both love talking to Alexa and having complete control of what they listen to) they also are being used for alarms (useful on school-day mornings!) and our 5 year old has been probing Alexa to answer some of the questions that pop into her head about various subjects (the meaning of life, quantum mechanics, M-theory, who is the guy dressed in the Barney suit, etc...) We have one in our bedroom for the same reasons, but also use the Bluetooth option to switch between playing music in the bedroom and the bathroom while taking a shower (just turning the Bluetooth speaker on in the bathroom moves the audio playback from the Dot to the speaker in the bathroom, then back to the dot again after the speaker is turned off again) so the music follows us wherever we may roam.    Our latest addition to the Dot family resides in our dining room, we like to have some music in the background while we eat, and the Dot covers this role nicely also.    Excellent little gizmo's and, i am sure, will multiply again as soon as we discover a &#34;need&#34; to have one of these in a different room in the house. For the price of these things, what is there not to like? ",

"Scott Jones","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"We are having a lot of fun with our Alexa.    This device listens for sounds it recognizes and then triggers pre-defined actions.  Amazon has built a lot of fun responses, as well as a lot of useful ones (Alexa, Weather; Alexa, Traffic; Alexa, Set Alarm; Alexa, Start Timer).  You can enable &#34;SKILLS&#34; to add a lot of functions and connectivity with other devices.    Alexa does not understand grammar.  It is strictly listening for sounds it has been programmed to recognize, there is no real A.I. behind this.  But you can speak some requests in a variety of different ways.  It's fun to pretend Alexa has artificial intelligence and try to talk to it.  But this is not &#34;Watson&#34;, it is not recognizing grammar or thinking in any way.  It's just recognizing sounds and checking them against a list of predefined responses and actions.    A note on PRIVACY:  The device is always listening for the sound &#34;ALEXA&#34; - listening but NOT sending audio to the cloud.  Once it hears &#34;ALEXA&#34; it begins recording and sending that recorded audio to the Amazon cloud computers for voice recognition.  Those recordings and the commands they trigger are stored on your Amazon account, not unlike how cell phones used to store a log of every text you sent.  But you can go on the app and delete them individually or as a whole.    Great product, fun device.  No reservations, get one for yourself today.  If you grow tired of it (we haven't) re-gift it. ",
"Michael J. Bosarge","April 16, 2017 ",2.0,"I'm in love with Alexa.  Before getting Alexa I would have to get up and adjust the stereo when I was gaming.  Now I just tell Alexa and she takes care of it for me.  Add in the Music Unlimited and I can have Ride of the Valkyrie playing while I fight the bad guys.  She's great in the morning.  Get up, get ready for work and ask her for the weather.  You've got it.  Now you don't have to look at the morning TV host who are all giddy in the morning while you're trying to wake up.  Alexa, give me the news.  Sit down, drink your coffee and listen to the news sources you've selected.  Short on coffee?  Alexa add coffee to my list.  When you go for groceries, pull the app up on your phone and there is the list Alexa has saved for you.  Leave a light on while you're at work.  Just go to the app and have Alexa turn it off.  Great applications and I can't wait to see what she'll do in the future. ",
"Code name April","February 17, 2017 ",5.0,"My husband bought this in November & it's connected to my Amazon prime account. So I've been doing Subscribe & Save for years now through Amazon. And when I started to get emails about what Alexa could do, I was informed I could reorder items through Alexa. What a joke! I have tried it numerous times to get her to reorder items but she says all the time that she can't find the items & has to put it to my shopping list. I tell her that it is on my Subscribe & Save & she still can't find it. As far as I can tell, she's really only good for playing music & telling me the weather. My kids ask her questions all the time & she can't give them good answers. The weird thing is she will start talking while we're having a meal. We don't say her name (which is the wake word) but she responds. Like another reviewer said, for a smart device, she isn't very smart. ",
"Michele S.","February 16, 2017 ",5.0,"It's very frustrating at times. For example, its awesome to be able to tell Alexa to set your alarm for 6 am. Some days you can tell it &#34;Alexa off&#34; to stop the alarm. Other days, you are screaming your lungs out and Alexa won't turn off no matter what you do, so you yank the thing out of the wall.  Hence, frustrating. It doesn't seem to understand as much as &#34;ok google&#34; on my phone. Alexa frequently says she doesn't understand. I hate also that it tries to get you to buy things--like extra music. No thanks. I also hated the fact that I bought it on &#34;special&#34; only to find that one week later it was on sale even cheaper.  But to send it back and re-purchase it would have cost nearly as much as the sale, so that sucked.  I think if it could do more, and understand more, I'd be happier with it. ",
"ERICA ARRIAGA","April 3, 2017 ",3.0,"To give it five stars it truly must be powerful. I finally caved in and decided to get an Echo Dot to take my home automation a step further. First off the price is great. very reasonable and easily cost effective to add more. now I have mine in my bedroom and it works flawlessly. the app is easily to connect to. (I have an iPhone)  and connecting my Nest (smart thermostat) and philips hue was a breeze, along with my wemo switches. My absolute favorite is having IFTTT (if this then that) application installed. Every night I say &#34;Alexia trigger bedtime&#34; and like magic all the nights in my room turn off. Since my room is so close to the kitchen i often step over to set a timer or alarm and when my lights start flashing through the house i know my timer is off. Let me tell ya, this alone has saved a few dozen cookies from burning 😉.  I'm fine with the loudness of the speaker as back noise to whatever I'm doing and setting up Pandora and I heart radio is a breeze. Also connecting a Bluetooth speaker is super easy and works like a charm.    I often have Alexia set alarms, turn on and off the lights, news brief .  I trigger (using IFTTT) bedtime, partymode(makes the hue lights change colors in a rainbow fashion), oh and try alexia trigger self destruct 😂    I really enjoy my Echo Dot and i definitely see myself buying the larger one plus another Dot in the future. I hope over time it continues to improve and get smarter 😊 ",
"Calvin Law","March 17, 2017 ",3.0,"So far so good. Got my dot in a perfectly nice and sealed package. Functions like it's suppose to and looks great. I do wish they had better search functions like looking for plane tickets or bus/train schedules nearby. Their list of partnered devices is great but not the best. Commands not as flexible as the Google Home. Certain commands are set in stone and it's hard to work around. But overall its amazing! Just missing some functions. ",
Dan,"February 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I really do like this thing.  I'm holding onto one star because it can't wake you to music.  I can tell it to play almost any song or tell it to wake me up at a certain time, but it doesn't have the ability to become a replacement for my radio alarm clock.  Waking to music (without using silly hacks) should be a something it should do.  But no, now I'm stuck with two devices on my night stand because I can't give up my radio alarm clock. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 2, 2016 ",4.0,"Amazing product!!!.  Without pairing to sound system the small built in speaker is still good enough to chill and listen to music on. Extremely fast and accurate. Connects to my big Sony Bluetooth sound system!  Immediately responds to commands and gives me instructions on multiple things. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 25, 2016 ",3.0,"I use the echo mainly for playing music and it is not very good at that. It has trouble finding songs that are otherwise available. Example: Alexa, play Black and Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play Black n Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play OU812 by Van Halen. It plays. Alexa, next track, Alexa, next track . . . lo and behold, 5 more &#34;next tracks&#34; later and Black and Blue is playing. Alexa stop. Well, Alexa might stop or you might have to say stop 3 more times. And even if it stops, it might randomly start playing again which is very annoying if you are on a phone call. Or you say &#34;next track&#34; and it goes silent and is thinking and then it just continues playing the track it was on. I don't have a speech impediment. Voice text on my phone understands what I say. I don't know why this stupid hockey puck can't. And god forbid you want to play a classical piece. I have a lot of classical music in my library and it won't play by composer or artist. I have to use the app to play almost any classical music in my library which defeats the purpose of the echo. I may as well just play it on the computer.  We use the jeopardy skill and play daily. No problems there. Once in a while I listen to the news or radio stations and it is pretty good at that, but again, switching stations may work the first time you ask or it may not. Very frustrating to have to keep barking &#34;play NPR&#34; and then it just continues playing 80s playlist. I would not recommend this to someone who would use it mostly for music. ",
"Texas Jack","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Great product!  It does everything as advertised and MORE.  I am now able to use Alexa voice commands for my X10 devices simply by adding two free programs called HEYU (to send X10 commands) and HA-bridge (this emulates a Phillips Hue bridge) on an old Raspberry Pi model B.  After installing and setting up these two programs, simply tell Alexa to &#34;Discover Devices&#34;.  Alexa will find everything you configured in the  HA-bridge software.  You can tell Alexa to now turn ON, OFF, or DIM those devices, it communicates to the HA-bridge software which then tells the HEYU program to send the X10 command over the power lines via a X10 CM11A transceiver (or wireless if you have a firecracker device connected to the Raspberry Pi).  For full instructions, search the web for &#34;UPDATED Amazon Echo X10 Home Control&#34; by Corey. ",

BUT she is being programmed each day with new things to say, so she does not know everything and can Not answer everything,  BIT I LOVE HAVING THEM HERE :) ",
valady,"January 17, 2017 ",5.0,"I really like my Alexa echo dot and am enjoying using it to assist around my house. It was very easy to install, once I had the app to download to my laptop. I had to contact Amazon customerr service to get that app. It can find my phone, set a timer, tell me the time, temperature, current news; play music, answer questions from Wikipedia, turn on & off various electronics, etc. The one problem I am having with it is that it doesn't always 'wake up' when I first address it. Even though I am usuallly sitting less than 8 feet from it and the house is quiet, I have to say, &#34;Alexa&#34; several times before 'she' wakes up and I get a response to a command. Additionally, while the &#34;find phone&#34; feature was enabled and used only a couple of days ago, when i went to use it this evening. Alexa told me that i needed to enable the 'tracker' feature. Hmm. I hope that Amazon will add more features to Alexa and update the dot periodically with improvements. ",
"Peter E.","April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I love this!!!  When these first came out I didn't think it would be something I would use much.  At least, not until my whole house has smart appliances.    My wife didn't want me to buy it she couldn't see the use for it.    She became addicted to it the first night. Especially if you sign up for Amazon Prime Music which has a huge selection for about $4 a month.    We've been watching less TV and listening to more music which is wonderful.    I love using the shopping list and to do list feature.    My 2.5 year old loves it and already talks to Alexa. We play kids song mixes they have and he dances away.    The weather and time, calculations and conversions and Wikipedia are really helpful to have around.    It's loud enough for a living room but I do want the full sized one eventually and move this to a bedroom.    The voice recognition is amazingly good too. You don't have to pause for a moment after saying Alexa. Just speak as you would to anyone home. It's really impressive.    You also don't notice it's even there, the design is so good.    I can go on and on so let's just say I didn't think I would use it much but heard rave reviews from friends and love having it!!! ",
Edgar,"April 25, 2017 ",4.0,"Better buy than the Echo tower from my perspective.  Very compact, can hide behind a lamp base, easy link to Bose mini speakers, love asking for various music to be played commercial free, very happy with it.  The instructions say a minimum of 3' from a speaker and you definitely want to have sufficient space between so it does not get confused with the sound and your voice.  iPhone App works very well for setup and changing any options.  Nice job Amazon!! ",
Bradley,"January 22, 2017 ",5.0,"I have owned my dots for about 6 months now, and there is only good things to say! If you're​ a die-hard Amzon user, then you must buy this product and welcome Alexa into your home! In these past 6 months, Alexa's voice recognition has greatly improved! Using machine learning allows Alexa to improve her voice recognition skills daily. The more people talk to Alexa, the more she learns and improves.    If you are a Prime member and/or a Amazon Unlimited member, you can ask her to play almost any song you can think of! If you want to hear a certain album, then ask her. Or if you want a radio station, the music will not end! Or if you want a certain genre of music, just ask!    Alexa becomes a part of the family. If you want the news read, she will. If you're​ celebrating a birthday, ask Alexa to sing &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; and she will happily; it's beautiful too! From playing music, to singing, to answering questions and playing games, Alexa will fit into your home! If you start off with one dot, you'll probably be buying more later on. One tip to improve voice recognition is to go-to the settings in the Alexa app, and do a voice training on each Echo you have. This greatly enhanced my experience. I have heard Amazon is working on a feature that will give Alexa the ability to recognize the voice that is speaking. That means no more switching profiles, as she knows it's you. This will also allow her to filter out other people taking, so you will no longer have to ask people to quiet down before taking to her! ",
"Sid Scheck","March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"&nbsp;It was about 2 weeks ago when I was talking with my friend about their Echo Dot and she showed me a few things. I thought very cool and maybe I should get one. Sure enough, 2 days later I won one at a company event. The Echo Dot is generally easy to set up. Be sure to have the Amazon Alexa  App downloaded when you are going to set up the Echo Dot. As I used it to ask questions, it has amazed me. I don't show it in the video, but I asked Alexa to put an item it my shopping cart and sure enough, there in my shopping cart was the item. I can see I will be using the Alex to listen to different types of music as well. So much you can do with it. Have fun! You will love it! ",
"H. Salsano","March 12, 2017 ",5.0,"This was our first Echo Dot, and we love her.  Although, not sure she always loves us, as sometimes she doesn't even answer us.  She seems to have a hearing deficiency.  We do have to speak loud and clear for her to even hear us, and especially if we want her to actually understand us.  The problem is mostly when she is playing music or the TV is on.  Of course, she can hear everyone on the TV just fine and respond to all the Alexa commercials.  Good think I have the purchasing PIN set up so only I can order things!  I like listening to the news feeds from Cnet, NPR and the weather.  I like controlling the TV, AV system and lights through her.  I add items to the Our Groceries android app through her, and she usually gets it right.  I use the timer and alarm functions often, especially when my 2 other kitchen timers are already running for other things.  I can tell her to &#34;Turn on Amazon Music&#34; which turns on the stereo and selects Aux, turns on the Amazon Basics Bluetooth receiver, and then I tell her what to play and it comes through the stereo.  I can even listen to kindle books and such this way for more volume.  Love the pause and resume, in case the phone rings.  For music, I tell her to Skip this song when something awful come on .  As time goes on, I find more useful things.  I am now looking at a new skill to alert friends if there is an emergency, called Ask My Buddy, which sounds useful for when one of us is home alone and something happens. ",
NurseMeg,"March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I originally bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts and didn't buy one for myself.  BIG MISTAKE!  I gave the first one to my father-in-law and I liked it so much that I opened one of the other presents and kept it to use with my home automation. Don't worry, it wasn't easy around Christmas time, but I did get one of these to replace the one I lifted from the expected receiver.  I then decided to get another one as a gift for my father.  I gave each of my fathers a wemo accessory to get them started in the home automation. I put mine in the kitchen to make use of the grocery list, play music while cooking dinner, and get weather/traffic while I am getting things ready to head out the door for work.  We used this a lot around Christmas time to play Christmas music. I synced this with 2 Nest thermostats and 3 Wemo light switches on exterior lighting of my house.  I can tell Alexa to turn on/off my outside lights and they all turn on/off or I can individually turn them on/off by their location (turn on/off front porch light).  I can tell Alexa to adjust the temperature of my downstairs, upstairs, or both thermostats to a given temperature. It would be nice to ask Alexa what the temperature of the upstairs/downstairs is and receive a temperature read back.  All in all I am enjoying it for my needs and recommend it! I believe it will only get better with time and addition of new devices.    I did have one odd thing happen with the Echo Dot recently.  This past week a song randomly started playing. I didn't say &#34;alexa&#34; or ask for anything to be played and it started playing when no one was in our kitchen area. Does have me worried a bit and wondering how it started playing the music. ",
Monta,"March 9, 2017 ",5.0,"I mainly bought this for large entertainment center which I placed lights in the cabinet 4 doors. I had  originally had the lights on a timer , but the days going from long and shorter days lights would come on way to early.it was a pain to move the cabinet to adjust the timer.Now with Echo paired with WeMo I can have Alexa turn lights on and off. WeMo app I can set the lights to turn on and off useing it that way too.. but it's fun telling Alexa to do it😀 ",
Tina,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I am totally in love with my echo dot!!  Alexa is awesome, and she will even thank you if you tell her. ;)  I know there could be improvements, and I'm sure she will just keep improving, but she is still well worth every dime now. She not only tells the time and weather, etc but I can just tell her what to put in my shopping list both with an app and without.  She reads to me, even just regular kindle books, and if it's possible to overuse the timer then I am sure to find out lol because I use it all the time.  She is loud too.  I thought I'd need a speaker for it but we can hear her just fine from all of our rooms.  Granted we only have 1 level, but we were still very impressed with her volume, and it's not even all the way up. We keep it on 7 or 8 and she's pretty loud. Highly recommend. ",
"Dianna Dougherty","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Received as a gift so can't complain much. It is JUST OK. There are def some bugs and its not very intuitive.  You can only ask it tings that it knows such as to play music or what the weather is. Everything has to be preset in the app. Nothing is automatically learned.  With google you can ask ANYTHING and it will read you the Wikipedia answer.  Not with alexa. Her knowledge is quite minimal.  One major flaw that i found and reported to amazon is this:  If you use a bose Bluetooth speaker with it and are playing a music and tell alexa to stop it will stop the music.  Okay there. Now you can walk away or leave your house and if your speaker has an automatic shut off as soon as the wireless speaker turns off it will begin playing the last song it stopped on trough its internal speaker so i have to tell it to stop again. Why would this be useful?? If i tell alexa to stop playing music and then power off the wireless speaker it starts playing again from built in audio. Immagine waking up in the middle of the night to music playing. Not fun. Needs to be as SMART as google and honestly not sure amazon will ever have that capability. But for 50bucks I guess you get what you pay for. ",
CM,"November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"This is such an awesome product! I saw the full-sized echo at a friend's house and was thoroughly impressed. I got the echo dot (I'm on a student budget) and hooked it up to a nice set of speakers in my apartment and I love the potential this thing has. It's not 100% there yet as far as the software but it is being updated on the regular, so its like buying a piece of technology that keeps getting better. I even bought one for my parents (who have a lot of smart devices in the house, but no central way to control them) as a gift. It works with most of the smart products u probably already have in your home including the nest thermostat/CO monitor etc. NOTICE: the 3.5 mm jack takes a bit more force than normal to &#34;click&#34; in when inserting an audio cable - your product is NOT defective lol. ",
"Roland W.","January 4, 2017 ",2.0,"&nbsp;Ok, the idea of not having to type your questions and getting pretty good and accurate answers (most of the time) is pretty amazing.  Set up was very easy, just download the Alexa App and then follow the step by step WIFI set up instructions. Right now I am only using it for basic requests (see video) and that works well. I will keep adding skills (these are additional little programs you can enable on the amazon.com website Just search &#34;Alexa Skills&#34; in the amazon search bar and it routes you to the menu. You can add sports teams, kids games etc. Alexa can tell you jokes (most of them are pretty funny and all so far are kid friendly).  Speaker quality is ok for such a small device - you can plug in an external speaker directly into the Dot and then you can control it through the Dot. I have a Sonos System (whole house), and I would have to get a separate DOT to plug into the sonos in my media centre, so the Dots can communicate. Have not done that so far. But it is a lot of fun to play around, get weather, movie times, play some background music or meditation songs etc. Just play around with it. I have a &#34;slight&#34; accent and it understands me without a problem.  Just be prepared that kids will yell at this little thing, demanding answers and a play buddy who gives them honest feedback on how their hair looks today :)    Currently I am using it mostly as a toy, but as my house is already rather high tech with everything wireless from thermostate (Lennox, which does not connect to ALEXA yet - per customer service) to security camera, Hue lights in some areas, I am planning on expanding the in house Dot Network over the coming months when manufacturers add more functionalities. I keep you posted.    I went on Amazon Skill website and enabled a ton of skills. Just make sure you write down how to activate them. (play 20 words, the secret door, bed time story etc.... you can have a lot of fun with these. I will get one for my daughters room so she can get &#34;Alexa, play relaxing songs for 15 minutes&#34; at bed time.

Hopels,"December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Replaced the larger Alexa Echo with the Dot 2nd Gen.  Obviously the much smaller size is nice.  I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.    The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.    We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.    Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.  I took off one star because while I have no issues with it, it sometimes doesn't &#34;hear&#34; my wife. ",
Rebecca,"January 19, 2017 ",5.0,"This little guy is fantastic! While I doubt anyone will be using the sheer wealth of functions this can perform (as some are, admitedly, quite lack-luster), the ones that I use it for are done well. Once the shiny veneer of new tech fades off, and you eventually stop asking Echo for jokes and punchlines, you won't be discarding her - which is common with other new innovations. Instead, you will probably use one of the following functions regularly, each of which I recommend getting the echo dot for:    -Setting kitchen timers: You won't think much of it until you try it, then you won't be able to go back. Just saying &#34;Alexa, start a timer for 20 minutes&#34; without jumbling for your phone, while simultaneously closing the oven is revolutionary. This is one of the best features Alexa has.    -Interactive Speaker Assistant: While I doubt audiophiles will be satisfied with Alexa's sound quality, that problem can easily be remedied, since you can just connect your own speakers through the audio jack, and Alexa will speak through them. The sound quality on the Echo Dot's speakers isn't bad, though, if you choose to listen through the dot. Either way, Alexa can search music from Spotify, Amazon Music, and Pandora via vocal commands. You can also set Spotify as your main music streamer (Amazon Music is the default, of course), so you won't have to verbally command Alexa to use Spotify, if that is your choice. It's great to just say a song, and have Alexa play it. ",
JMDK,"October 29, 2016 ",4.0,"The Good:    The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of &#34;Alexa&#34;, &#34;Amazon&#34; or &#34;Echo&#34;).    The Bad:    The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.    Overall:    We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature. ",
"Just me","March 14, 2017 ",5.0,"I am a big amazon fan and I depend on reviews. Let me start by saying I was so excited about this product even though my spouse was saying it will only make me lazy..Lol. I know there are several reviews on this product but here goes...I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen basically for the 2- level of our home; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive bigger one and too good to pass up. The Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the 2 floor!  Day 1 when I received it I was a little worried that I would need to send it back because Alexas first word would not sound; for example I would ask &#34;Alexa what time is it?&#34; and she would say &#34;Is 7:30pm&#34; or I would ask &#34;Tell me a joke&#34; and she would not say the first part of the joke, I asked &#34;how old are you?&#34; and the whole human part would not sound. FYI: you can read the answers on your app as well, that's how I knew I missed that part. The next day I came home and some kind of way she was answering all of the questions. I don't know if she just needed to be full charged or what, but the problem fixed itself.  I am really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. Considering everything, for $49 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to building your smart home, home automation and voice recognition technology. Overall, I would highly recommend this product. ",
SundayAtDusk,"December 30, 2016 ",5.0,"This was a Christmas present for my elder mother. We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device. ",
"The Bon","March 8, 2017 ",4.0,"We had an Echo and thought it was all we needed. We put it in our livingroom (by the kitchen) and I pick random songs to play during the day, but also ask questions whenever I'm watching a movie on TV or listening to a song and wonder if a star or singer is still alive (ask Alexa - Which is the Echo's name).  I put things on my 'shopping list and it goes on my phone automatically (and on my husband's phone too, since we both have the Alexa app on our phones.). Recipes, measurements, and facts about whatever. But it's nowhere near our bedroom, so I ordered an Echo Dot as an 'extension'.  I can't believe we lived without this little, inexpensive, companion. It's on my nightstand and acts as our alarm clock, news station, weather station, and music source that has EVERY KIND OF MUSIC you could possibly want, just for the asking.  We are so blessed to be living in a time where we can have these Amazon innovations at our fingertips. The Echo and Alexa both have replaced our clocks, encyclopedia, dictionary, stereo, cd's, etc. we ordered ours through the &#34;LOVE MY ECHO&#34; website where we also get all information on both.

"Colleen M Traeger","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Impressed. At first I really enjoyed the Echo Dot. It was fun asking it questions. Then the novelty wore off. In order to have your questions answered you first DL an app then ask it to open something. The apps are strange lengthy names that are hard to remember like &#34;Alexia, open &#34;My  Horoscope to read my daily horoscope&#34; instead of a simple 'what's my horoscope&#34;. There are 10k apps full of interesting and useless things. Why it can't be developed where you DL an app to customize your needs is beyond me.    What's interesting is that you can make your home a smart home and control it remotely or just by speaking what you need.    I've also loved asking it to add things to my to do list as well as add things to my shopping list.    While I do like it, I'm just a little disappointed. I'm hoping that this is similar to when Dot Matrix first came out.    I can without a doubt see the value in this maturing. I'll hang on to it (in 30 years it'll be worth a nice bundle). Regardless of the slight pessimistic review, I do recommend it. ",
"Sassy and Oliver","January 28, 2017 ",5.0,"I have both the Echo, and the Echo Dot. This little Dot works as well as its big sister Echo, only.... the 🔊 speaker is a wimp. However, if you are looking to save a lot on the price difference between the two, this one is the perfect compromise. Just expect poor sound quality. I think you can connect the Dot to better speakers, I just have not learned how. I use the Dot in my bedroom, and the big Echo in my living room. The big Echo has fantastic speakers and I don't need to turn the volume up very high.  Buy this Dot to save money, or buy the Echo for great speakers...both work the same. ",
Dia,"March 6, 2017 ",4.0,"Alexa is a lot of fun. I have added some of her skills but they don't seem to function as expected. She only speaks English, which while I can understand programming another language could've been a huge investment, it's still a disadvantage.    My favorite features are:  `playing music via a paired speaker. That sounds silly, but it's so convenient to just yell &#34;Alexa, play iheart radio&#34; when busy.  `timers. Asking her to set a timer is really convenient  `shopping list. She can add items to your shopping list which you can view on your smartphone when out of the house. For this forget-everything-gal, that feature is really helpful.  `controlling it with the app. My husband still doesn't know how I can turn down the music from the other room - or turn it on. I'll keep it a mystery for as long as I can. It's nice to be able to shut off a timer or change the volume from my phone when I'm on the other side of the house. ",
Jarren,"March 11, 2017 ",4.0,"This is a great item, especially as a developer. My baby cousins also enjoyed this product so much, I bought them one for Christmas. You can ask Alexa for holiday jokes. You can also say, &#34;Alexa, tell me I'm beautiful&#34;.    I use it for an alarm clock, to play music on Spotify, and to hear daily facts. You can also get some exclusive Alexa only deals. As a developer, you can get free hoodies / shirts from developing Alexa Skills and submitting it to the app store.    Beware though, you might get noise complaints from your upstairs neighbor from having this device. I guess this device playing a few songs at volume 7 (out of max 10) playing music at 7 pm can net you a noise complaint. I didn't even know the speakers were that great, but apparently so! :grimacing: ",
"Sid Scheck","March 12, 2017 ",4.0,"&nbsp;It was about 2 weeks ago when I was talking with my friend about their Echo Dot and she showed me a few things. I thought very cool and maybe I should get one. Sure enough, 2 days later I won one at a company event. The Echo Dot is generally easy to set up. Be sure to have the Amazon Alexa  App downloaded when you are going to set up the Echo Dot. As I used it to ask questions, it has amazed me. I don't show it in the video, but I asked Alexa to put an item it my shopping cart and sure enough, there in my shopping cart was the item. I can see I will be using the Alex to listen to different types of music as well. So much you can do with it. Have fun! You will love it! ",
"Amazon Customer","March 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I love the size and the price but the speaker is horrible. I have seen better speakers in smaller things so it's not like it can't be done. I can say that the microphone is really well-made it can pick my voice up 20 feet away in the Next Room  at  moderate levels  without having to yell. Like the Alexa, I wish it was more informative, there are so many questions I asked that Alexa does not know the answer to but Google does. I also wish that a lot of the apps were not third party where you have to ask Alexa to ask the app to do something like my buddy you have to say Alexa ask my buddy to send an alert message to a family member because I have fallen and can't get up it would be nice if you could say Alexa contact my family member and tell them I have fallen and cannot get up. But aside from that I love the direction that it's heading, I just wish it was there already we have the technology to make it happen I can only assume there's red tape involved ",
"Amazon Customer","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I thoughtful Echo was interesting, but wanted to opt with just the Dot and use my own Bluetooth speakers. Unfortunately, Amazon discontinued the first generation just as I was able to order.  When the second generation was announced, I knew I'd get one.  With the $10/ month for 5 month plan for Prime members, it was a no trainer. Although I'm more heavily into Apple's ecosystem, and gave smart appliances (Apple)  they will work with Alexander too.  There is quite a bit of crossover. I'm excited and look forward even using the Dot as an alarm clock, awakening me with my Prime Music. I'm sure it's going to be loads of other fun too. I also have a Kindle Fire HDX, FireStick, etc, and know it will integrate nicely.    I have had it for about a week and it's VERY cool!  Does so much more than even Siri by being able to add skills. Also works great with my iDevices switched simulataneously with iOS HomeKit. This was a great buy! ",
Stephanie,"November 14, 2016 ",3.0,"I like this Alexia dot thingy! Sometimes though she talks to me when I am not talking to her. She thinks she hears her name. She seems kinda needy. She's always there. Listening to my conversations and trying to include herself in them. I have to tell her that I wasn't talking to her and to only talk when she's been spoken to. She doesn't get the hint. Also when she hears her name on the Alexia commercials she responds. Overall I really like this contraption. It's pretty neat. It tells me anything I want to know. She even sang me the alphabet like William Shatner one day. She hasn't done it since. We liked her so much we got another one for upstairs. Alexia even controls our lights. Our house is basically automated. ",
"this is me","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"Absolutely love these. We bought the tall Echo. Got on the list before it came out. Then we bought a dot for our shop, Then we went back and bought the deal that was buy 5 get 1 free. These are amazing. We have one for almost every room. Although, I do not advise that. Reason being is that when you say &#34;Alexa, what is the forecast&#34; and loud enough, &#34;all&#34; of them start giving you the forecast...lol So, we keep them spread out. We also gave a couple to our adult kids for Christmas.    Great for helping to figure out math problems, telling jokes and you can even order amazon items from your echo. There is so much the echo dot can do. They are a must have.    PROS:  the clarity is very good.  the compact size is perfect  you can ask almost anything and he will have the answer    CONS:  my only con is that they sometimes wake up without us even talking.    But, these are highly recommended for sure. ",
LTCJDC,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"After three months of use, I don't like the Echo Dot or Alexa's attitude. It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't allow you to return an item after 30 days. I'd be returning it if they did. Common language isn't as successful as when verbally searching Google. Alexa can't find things without exact phrasing. I argue with her everyday because she doesn't understand me, doesn't have the answer or would like to sign me up for some Amazon product or service. She apologizes a lot. It is very frustrating and forces you to use the Alexa App to find what you need. The App is pretty good to find and control what you want the Dot to do.  Alexa can't always find things on iHeart radio or Tunein even though you listened to it 10 minutes before. She will sign you up for Amazon Music in a heartbeat. She does understand what &#34;worthless&#34; means and it quick to take offense. The Skills aren't very helpful and are mostly silly snippets that seem to have been written by young kids. Buy Google Home instead. You won't regret it. ",
"R. Seehoffer","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Well, I ordered 2 of these a few weeks ago and they arrived today. Both are now set up and functioning using the Alexa app. Very cool, I must say. I added several skills, including TP-Link's Kasa to control several devices around the house, and a few others that seemed interesting--all are working well. I've gone through and played with most of the abilities, linked up my Google Calendar, and went through the voice training. I've had a little trouble with the Alexa app freezing up, and some stutter on a few radio stations playing through Tunein, perhaps due to high bit rates. Speaker quality was better than I expected, and mic pickup from various locations seems fine. They're a pretty nice addition to a connected home, at a fairly smoking price.    Update: As time goes by, this thing just gets better. I have it playing music in the background all day via TuneIn, controlling a number of TP-Link switches and lights throughout the house, and giving me relevant news/information as needed. There are some very cool installable skills available, although I noticed that many of these skills are redundant as Alexa already does them natively. These include telling me a joke (as for knock/knock, physics, science, Star Trek or Star Wars, Christmas, etc), flipping a coin, picking a random number between x and y, or rolling dice, weather for one day or many, Wikipedia info, etc. I am just now getting into IFTTT and see several possibilities there. I've had no hiccups at all getting Alexa to hear me across the house, and triggering the correct unit based on my proximity. Smart home control has also worked perfectly. I've got one unit on my nightstand, and one in the living room. Alexa is also very polite. Wish it 'goodnight' or say 'thankyou'--the responses are not what you'd expect. Like I said in the title--a lot of fun. ",
ChuckG,"April 10, 2017 ",2.0,"I bought two of these Echo Dots because I already had some great bluetooth speakers, and did not need to purchase the larger Echo. I intend to stream music, and begin moving our home towards home automation.    Set up was simple via the IOS Alexa app, and I was off and running with Alexa streaming music from Pandora and Amazon Prime Music.    The App also detected my Honeywell thermostat, so Alexa can override and cool my house on demand beyond my already programmed thermostat schedule.    Last night, I purchased a Logitech Harmony Hub, and now my Living Room TV, Roku, Media Player and Home Theater system now work via voice!    My next step will be integrating some Phillips lights and hub into the system.    While for some there may be a learning curve to add connected devices, there are lots of resources online, and many YouTube videos too.    The only thing, Alexa cannot clean the house or make dinner yet! (g) ",
"Amazon Customer","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Being a previous X10 user, was looking for a better and more up to date way of controlling my lights and other devices.  Amazon Echo provided this control point at a price point that made it economical to place devices in multiple rooms.  I coupled it with the Samsung SmartThings hub and control devices from GE, Cree and GoControl as well as my Harmony device used to control my Entertainment center.  Alexa was able to recognize and control the lighting devices but for the Harmony devices you need to ask Alexa to ask Harrmony to perform an action and this appears to be the case for a lot of other add-ons where you need to remember the service name to issue a command.  My biggest disappointment was that Alexa is 100% reliant on its Internet connection and connection to the Amazon servers.  If your Internet connection is down, or the servers are down then Alexa is about as useful as lead boots at a swimming competition.  In the 4 weeks since I deployed, my Internet has been down once and the Amazon servers unresponsive making Alexa useless to control my devices or even set a wake up alarm.  Would be nice if a set of base commands were installed on the device that allowed it to function with locally connected devices without having to talk to the Mother Ship first. ",

Mooj,"March 17, 2017 ",3.0,"Love this. Makes life just a little easier. When I wake up, I can have Alexa give me the weather and any reminders for the day. If I get the urge to listen to a particular song, album or artist, all I have to do is ask (this is particularly useful while playing video games or packing for my move). Pretty much anything I want to know, I just ask. She even plays games (you got nothing on me when it comes to Simpsons trivia, Alexa!). Why can't life always be this easy?    Definitely considering buying another one for the other room in the new apartment. And I definitely recommend to anyone.    One suggestion to anyone buying, however. Make sure you have a good speaker to attach it to because the sound isn't great out of the dot itself (which is understandable given its size and cost). I use a TDK A33 Bluetooth portable speaker, which gets great sound for a little portable speaker and works flawlessly with the dot. ",
"Peter E.","March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"I love this!!!  When these first came out I didn't think it would be something I would use much.  At least, not until my whole house has smart appliances.    My wife didn't want me to buy it she couldn't see the use for it.    She became addicted to it the first night. Especially if you sign up for Amazon Prime Music which has a huge selection for about $4 a month.    We've been watching less TV and listening to more music which is wonderful.    I love using the shopping list and to do list feature.    My 2.5 year old loves it and already talks to Alexa. We play kids song mixes they have and he dances away.    The weather and time, calculations and conversions and Wikipedia are really helpful to have around.    It's loud enough for a living room but I do want the full sized one eventually and move this to a bedroom.    The voice recognition is amazingly good too. You don't have to pause for a moment after saying Alexa. Just speak as you would to anyone home. It's really impressive.    You also don't notice it's even there, the design is so good.    I can go on and on so let's just say I didn't think I would use it much but heard rave reviews from friends and love having it!!! ",
"Eric Smith","February 11, 2017 ",5.0,"OK, maybe Alexa deserves a better rating given she does what she is advertised to do. But after having her in the house for a month, I found the Echo Dot was only being used for novelty purposes or responding to false positives. At the price point, it seemed like a good opportunity to try out a home assistant, but it wasn't something we used on a daily basis. In hindsight, it seems pointless to use in conjunction with a smart phone. I have a Nexus with Google Assistant which does everything the Echo was doing for me and usually does it better. Plus the phone is almost always with me rather than isolated in one room of the house. &#34;OK Google...&#34; works with my IoT switches and outlets, news briefings, weather updates, online information and adding items to my shopping list. Aside from novelty, I see no point is buying into another eco-system unless you really like instant ordering from Amazon. ",
"Avatars VR Arcade","January 22, 2017 ",5.0,"This product is amazing and clever. It works great for when you want to just listen to some music or hear the news etc. without fiddling with any devices. Especially when your busy doing other activities like cooking. It also has some very funny and smart programming. You will get some very funny responses depending on what you ask it. Also the microphones are excellent and can understand you easily even when the music is playing. My kids love asking it to tell a joke. I love asking it factual information that I have questions about and want a quick answer. I have it connected by Bluetooth to my TVs soundbar. It's great, buy it now. How many products can make you and your family smarter?    Only thing I would improve is adding an audible tone to the ring that lights up when it is ready for a response so if you are not looking at it, you would still know that it heard you call it's name and is ready for a command or question.

"G. Bigelow","April 3, 2017 ",2.0,"This is on this dot only. I'll give 5 stars on my overdo remove of my second one. Let me just iterate that I love the Dots. Way more than expected to.    This one however has developed problems with the Bluetooth and now plays intermittent static instead of music over an external speaker. Oddly it's voice broadcasts just fine and it plays music through its internal speaker perfectly. That is why I think the problem lies in its transmitting over Bluetooth. I didn't bother getting warranty protection and as the only option on the order was to write a review I'm guessing I'm SOL on resolution. This isn't a major problem as it will still work fine for what I wanted it for. And if I want to go through the bother of switching all the alarms and settings I could switch this one for the one in the kitchen.    To sum up: amazing product, problem with one aspect of one unit.

"Just me","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I am a big amazon fan and I depend on reviews. Let me start by saying I was so excited about this product even though my spouse was saying it will only make me lazy..Lol. I know there are several reviews on this product but here goes...I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen basically for the 2- level of our home; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive bigger one and too good to pass up. The Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the 2 floor!  Day 1 when I received it I was a little worried that I would need to send it back because Alexas first word would not sound; for example I would ask &#34;Alexa what time is it?&#34; and she would say &#34;Is 7:30pm&#34; or I would ask &#34;Tell me a joke&#34; and she would not say the first part of the joke, I asked &#34;how old are you?&#34; and the whole human part would not sound. FYI: you can read the answers on your app as well, that's how I knew I missed that part. The next day I came home and some kind of way she was answering all of the questions. I don't know if she just needed to be full charged or what, but the problem fixed itself.  I am really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. Considering everything, for $49 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to building your smart home, home automation and voice recognition technology. Overall, I would highly recommend this product. ",
"Diane J Owen","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Alexa goes in spurts in my house. She's probably lonely, cause I like quiet and I forget about her. But, she's really good at playing music--I hooked her up to my speakers. She's fun to play games with. Amazon sends ideas all the time, like ordering special deals, or music playlist. They enable new skills, like apps, all the time. I like Magic 8 Ball. Ask her if Trump will last four years. Anyway, well worth her small investment. ",

There is information on the services that work with Echo.  I know of a service my friends use that does not work with Echo if  you use that service you may want to check out the Google Home speaker.    The speaker is not great so I would suggest pairing it with a BlueTooth speaker because the sound is not great as a stand alone.  I got the [[ASIN:B013GBRR32 Philips BT6000R/37 Splash-Proof Wireless Portable Speaker (Red)&nbsp;from Amazon and the Dot sounds much better and the speaker is splash proof which a more durable choice for a kid.  Amazon also has colorful&nbsp;Amazon Echo Dot Case (fits Echo Dot 2nd Generation only) - Indigo Fabric&nbsp;to match room decor.

When she plays music, she will tell me the title and artist when I ask. I understand that I can add a speaker to the Dot but I think the sound is great just the way it is. Very good quality! It has volume setting from one to ten. Just ask her to set the number you prefer. Everything is done with your voice. She even turns my bedroom light on and off when I ask. Be sure to say good morning, she will always tell you something! I got this for my blind, elderly mother and it has been a life changing experience for mother. Alexa is her companion. ",
Adrian,"January 10, 2017 ",2.0,"This is a slightly useful device. It's ok for asking web search info items , like weather or scores, and a few other things.  I had a lot of problems connecting to it initially, becuase I use 2-factor authentication on my account and by the time I had gone to my authenticator app and got a code, returned to Alexa app and gone through the login process again, the code expired. I had to turn off 2-factor on my account, and even then it made me do a capcha that was complicated by the fact that the app won't scroll, so I was typing in the capcha field blind. Thanks for the frustration, Alexa. I have secure physical possession of both devices, why can't the process be much easier?  I have a Harmony hub for AV control, and Alexa can use it. Once again, connection problems abound, as the Alexa app insisted that I didn't have a Harmony hub, even though the Harmony app is on the very same phone that Alexa app is on. Eventually I was successful. Then came the sad discovery that all it can do is turn AV gear on and off. There went my dream of tuning my dvr by voice command. More frustration.  So then I linked my Spotify account to have it play thru bluetooth speakers. This works, but every time I return to play music again, I have to manually make spotify use the bluetooth speakers, as it defaults to using the Dot speaker. Haven't found a work-around yet. Thanks for nothing, Alexa.  As far as simple voice commands, it works about 80% of the time. Sometimes it ignores me, sometimes it whines about the internet connection. I live in a rural neighborhood that's not too badly wifi congested. My cell phone stays connected anywhere on my property but Alexa struggles from a 30 foot distance to my wifi router. It randomly announces when it connects to the wifi or bluetooth. It reacts to what it hears on TV sometimes(yes I have done the voice training), which leads to baffling announcements. I say 'Alexa, shut up&#34; a lot.  In summary, this would be a good deal at $19. Too bad it cost $50.  I'll keep it, but it doesn't really do anything my Nexus 6 won't do with the &#34;OK Google&#34; function. Amazon is a major cloud provider, why can't they put a good web app up for connecting and configuring and linking?  I can't recommend this device unless you are a 'smart home' hobbyist who wants to spend money linking it to Zwave or Zigbee devices.  UPDATE: I decided to keep this and use it as a voice commanded search engine for simple questions, but its results have been poor. I will be returning it as being nearly useless to me.  When it failed to answer a question, I repeated the question to Ok Google on my phone, and in all cases it was able to answer. Here are some of those questions:  1. When was the piano invented?  2. Who was Field Marshal von Rundstedt?  3. What is maximum allowed length of a golf club?  I'm not interested in using this as am Amazon shopping tool, which it is probably good at. I'm sending it back. ",

And of course the Audible for only $14.99 a month, and you have a free trial for a month and two free books of your choice!(after free trial it is going to cost $14.99 per month but you get a free credit for any book!)    And then Music! You can add up to 250 songs to the amazon music cloud and hear it anywhere with your echo dot. FOR FREE! It can be any songs you bought digital from any source, google, itunes you name it. And if you have reach the limit for 250 songs, you can just pay as little as $7.99 a month for ulimate and Amazon Music is free to listen too!    And yeah you can ask question that you want to know the answer, from a country, a person, an animal, a place, or any facts etc. And Alexa is just so smart to answer everything and Alexa is learning day to day with new skills.

timdtoolman,"January 27, 2017 ",2.0,"Love it!! Works extremely well. I wanted to start getting into &#34;Smart Home&#34; technology and although I can use Siri on my iphone to do the same thing the Echo dot does sometimes my phone is in my pocket so I am not able to communicate with Siri, that's where the Elixa and the Echo Dot comes in handy. I have not seen hardly any negative reviews on YouTube for the Echo line and the Echo Dot is an inexpensive way to get into this new personal assistant space. The Echo Dot does have a speaker that will allow you to communicate with Elixa but if you intend on listening to music you will want to connect a external speaker via aux. cable or bluetooth which is very easy to connect using the Elixa app. After using the Echo Dot for about a week now I have been very impressed with it's voice recognition skills as they are extremely reliable and very well implemented.    With Elixa you can get the weather forecast,  listen to music of any kind, ( $3 a mo. prime music membership required) control almost anything in your home with the proper components (sold separately) and so far I just use Elixa to turn on and off my bedroom lights by just speaking which is so cool.    I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get into the personal assistant technology, you will not be disappointed. ",

For instance, when I set a timer or alarm on one dot, I really want the timer to sound on other dots in other parts of the house.  If Amazon provided an option to synchronize functions like the timers and alarms, this would be a great system.  Amazon could you please provide the option to synchronize on your next software update? ",
"Charles D","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This product is by far the best Smart Home device I have purchased. The only part to get used to is learning what to say to get the desired results. That is the learning curve, which I think is kind of fun to me. Naming all of your devices is fun to do even more so if your creative with naming them. It connects with my wink hub and all of my other connected devices. It has a ton of useful features to make your everyday life much easier and efficient.    My wife loves it as well, she did not know what to think at first but that quickly changed once she learned how to make her shopping list jut by talking to alexa. I really enjoy the ease of playing music. This is the link to make your smart home truly smart. ",
"Roland W.","April 12, 2017 ",2.0,"&nbsp;Ok, the idea of not having to type your questions and getting pretty good and accurate answers (most of the time) is pretty amazing.  Set up was very easy, just download the Alexa App and then follow the step by step WIFI set up instructions. Right now I am only using it for basic requests (see video) and that works well. I will keep adding skills (these are additional little programs you can enable on the amazon.com website Just search &#34;Alexa Skills&#34; in the amazon search bar and it routes you to the menu. You can add sports teams, kids games etc. Alexa can tell you jokes (most of them are pretty funny and all so far are kid friendly).  Speaker quality is ok for such a small device - you can plug in an external speaker directly into the Dot and then you can control it through the Dot. I have a Sonos System (whole house), and I would have to get a separate DOT to plug into the sonos in my media centre, so the Dots can communicate. Have not done that so far. But it is a lot of fun to play around, get weather, movie times, play some background music or meditation songs etc. Just play around with it. I have a &#34;slight&#34; accent and it understands me without a problem.  Just be prepared that kids will yell at this little thing, demanding answers and a play buddy who gives them honest feedback on how their hair looks today :)    Currently I am using it mostly as a toy, but as my house is already rather high tech with everything wireless from thermostate (Lennox, which does not connect to ALEXA yet - per customer service) to security camera, Hue lights in some areas, I am planning on expanding the in house Dot Network over the coming months when manufacturers add more functionalities. I keep you posted.    I went on Amazon Skill website and enabled a ton of skills. Just make sure you write down how to activate them. (play 20 words, the secret door, bed time story etc.... you can have a lot of fun with these. I will get one for my daughters room so she can get &#34;Alexa, play relaxing songs for 15 minutes&#34; at bed time.

Greg,"November 5, 2016 ",5.0,"Totally Awesome, if only using to listen to music and making to-do/grocery lists!!!  I no longer have to use my phone or tablet to listen to music at home, once set up these are completely independent of your phone/tablet.  Definitely recommend the Echo Dot/Bluetooth speaker combo especially with a speaker that sounds good.  So convenient to walk into a room and say &#34;play whatever you want to hear&#34; and say &#34;what volume level you want&#34;.  The To-Do and Grocery List is a huge plus, whenever you think of something just say it and it goes on your list, if you're not home and the wife or kids need something they can just tell Alexa and it gets on your list.  So many more things it can do, highly recommend. ",
"Brandon R.","January 19, 2017 ",5.0,"This little Gadget is awesome. I gave it 5 stars because it does what it says and it works very well. Now it was very easy to hook up handworks just fine. Now I know this is on you product and the skills are limited and they're making new skills for it. It can insult you, it can make you laugh, which it has plenty of times. My whole family uses it whenever they passed by they asked for a joke they are funny. The your mama jokes are funny too. This would be even better if it has skills for information it is limited to what it can do what is a very fun Gadget to play . I've used it to play music, I've also used it to ask the time to set reminders it's capable of doing lots of things looking forward to new skills there are so many things that I can do. If you get one which I recommend play with the app to get the skills you want and use it. There is no battery so you can't move it around the house unless you unplug it or buy a battery pack that I believe they sell for it to move it around the house. You cannot take it with you at least outside of your Wi-Fi range. Would be cool if you can take this wherever you go and use it if you can I haven't figured that out yet. yet that will be super cool it comes with its own plug for powering it up and to connect to a separate speaker if you want. As for the way it sounds you can control the volume on the echo Dot and you can also connected to a Bluetooth speaker you can also connect your cell phone to it or tablet Android volume off of the echo Dot. I like the volume that it has I don't use a Bluetooth speaker I don't think you need it unless you want it louder. I DJ so I can connect it to my system and get more volume butt no need for it it's loud enough for me. It's a little bigger than a hockey puck I have it in white. It comes in different colors they have a couple of accessories you can buy for it. This by far is the coolest Gadget I've gotten for myself. I definitely recommend this for everyone that has Wi-Fi. If you get one play with it and enjoy lots of fun. ",
"Damian Jaundoo","October 31, 2016 ",5.0,"I remember star trek and wanting the ability to speak to the computer and it would do what i ask or give me the answer to something. I never in my lifetime ever thought that technology would arrive and be affordable. Well the ECHO is flat out an awesome product. I got the first one as a gift and purchased a second along with smart plugs and plan on buying more related items to add on. It is just wonderful and while new it is not only functional and usable it gets better. Since its cloud based you dont have to worry about technology getting more advanced and making this out dated it just keeps getting better with more features. the way i see it eventually it will be in every room of my house. I have two wifi routers and it will control devices on the other network. It is just so much more than i expected. If your an Amazon prime user you will not regret buying this but make sure you know what you are getting yourself into. This is just the starter product which is great by itself. You may need bluetooth speakers for large rooms smart switches and lights smart hubs etc... to complete your home so if you are willing to take that plunge understand it will get expensive as you will want to do it.

richc007,"December 9, 2016 ",5.0,"I love this device and can not see why anyone wouldn't.  Even in only its 2nd iteration, its fantastic. Nothing beats being able to control electronics with your voice.    I have bought a few smart bulbs and power outlets, so far, that work flawlessly with Alexa and were super easy to setup using the app.    I paired my Harmony remote using IFTTT so I can voice command my remote control activities.    Because of the joy and desire to continue to make my house &#34;smart&#34; the proverbial Christmas list now includes a thermostat and garage door opener to name a few smart items.    I am sure the future software updates with bring tons of additional features that I will love as well.  I have already pre-orded the attachable battery as having the Dot portable will make it far more useful.  Especially when in the pool and listening to music or books.    I wont belabor the value in having all of your amazon music and audible books on voice demand.  Its just very convenient.    The amazon shopping integration is great, but not the reason I bought the echo.  I bought it so I can talk to my electronics, and it does that very very well.    Don't hesitate buying this item.  Its something you will use many times each day and I doubt you own many other things, that you use that often, that only cost you 50 bucks.    Nice job on this product Amazon. ",
R0iB0i,"December 30, 2016 ",5.0,"I was going to purchase this on Amazon since everyone out here in the state is out of stock. Luckily I found an Amazon Pop-up and they were in stock. I couldn't decide which color I wanted so, I got one of each. I had set up the first one, which is simple and straight forward, and I loved it so much I kept the other one. I bought a 3rd one as well and gifted to my mom for xmas and she loves it. I dont know why I didn't get this in the past.    The only cons I have is the app itself. I personally think it needs to be redesigned for better simplicity and speed. The app likes to not work at times and will lag. Other than that, I wold recommend this ",

"Amazon Customer","December 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought this as a gift to my husband and I for Christmas and I love it. I am a bit of a geek, but certainly not enormously tech savvy.  Amazon has figured out how to make installation of the Echo Dot happen smoothly in under 5 minutes.  I am planning on adding a second one to our bedroom. It will be great to just set an alarm by voice, especially when it's a day where the time is different from the norm, listen to music, hear my calendar and the news, etc.  I would recommend eventually buying a bluetooth speaker though you can hook up a hardwire speaker to it.  The speaker it comes with is adequate at first if you are looking to save money initially.  Recently we bought a TP SmartLink Plug (after trying to connect a Belkin which was exasperating and didn't work) and it connected within, again, about 5 minutes at most.  My husband who isn't tech savvy loves being able to say &#34;Living Room on&#34; and having the lights turn on, especially since he has mobility issues.  Alexa, how did we live without you? ",
DS0078,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Been an IT guy for 20+ years. I also install audio/visual systems like Control4. So I am not easily impressed. I put off buying an Alexa device for some time and finally broke down to &#34;try one out&#34; just for the hell of it. So I bought a Dot because I have at least 5 small powered speakers around the house and garage. But let me tell you, this thing is freaking scary cool! I feel like I am in an episode of Star Trek (yes I am that old). First off I am a Prime member, so I ask for music and it plays music. I linked my Pandora account. I asked for Alexa to play Stevie Ray Vaughn from my Pandora account. She replied with, You do not have a Stevie Ray Vaughn station, would you like for me to add one? I said Yes. She added and started playing. Freaking cool! I am also an active stock trader so I asked for stock quotes and she was not able to answer that. Keep in mind this technology is in its infancy! I can only imagine what I will be able to control or ask in the near future?!?! I like the idea of the Alexa with the built in speaker but 179.00 is kind of high in my opinion when powered speakers are so cheap. The only thing is you need two outlets to power both when you buy a DOT vs the Alexa with a speaker..... But to start out and give this thing a try, WOW is all I can say about the DOT right now. VERY impressed. ",
joabkonnor&amp;amp;adysen,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"My husband gave me one as an early Christmas present last night. Immediately fell in love!!!!

Fast forward a few hours I knew we needed a second one so I swooped one up at Fred Meyers and the kids are having a blast playing music and asking questions. Thanks amazon for another great product! Keep em coming! We are long time customers with several kindles and kindle fires. You never fail us! And thanks for making music unlimited affordable on the echo! I have a feeling we will order few more of these after the holidays are over. ",
Terry,"November 22, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my echo dot. Having a hands free remote control is truly helpful from setting timers to smart home control. The other day my power had gone out overnight and I kept thinking I should set my stove clock every time I walked by but didn't have my phone. Duh! Alexa what time is it. Fixed. I'm getting older and it's easy to space on the shopping list. Alexa, add milk to the shopping list. Then when at the store I just open the Alexa app and look at my shopping list. Fixed. I think Alexa is going to be my new best friend. Lol. My setup is using a Hook SmartHome server with etekcity switches. The advantage is the cost. The hook talks wifi to rf. The etekcity switches are rf and only $5 per outlet vs. $35-40 for wemo. So now Alexa turn tv on, Alexa turn living room light on. Love it! Now if only Next up when budget allows will be a Logitech Harmony - wifi to IR to control the apple tv, dvd player etc. Alexa Channel 5. Alexa pause movie. Now if only I could find inexpensive light controls. Alexa Night mode! Someday.    Oh, and Alexa is really awesome at picking music for me, I've listened to a bunch of new artists and the idea of needing to work on a playlist is vanished. Alexa Music! And so easy to Alexa Skip or Alexa Thumbs Up. Five Stars - but would give 10 if I could.    P.S. I gave some thought to purchasing Echo instead but had some speakers so went with the dot. I'm glad I did. Not only less expensive I've found that sometimes Alexa can struggle hearing the wake up word if the speakers are close and loud so I plan on keeping the dot at a bit of distance from the speakers. The Dot is fabulous at hearing the wake up word over the tv and managed well even when I had a cold.. ",
MityMike,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Setup was very easy and I enjoy the Dot so far. Voice recognition is great and I used it to stream my music, as a kitchen timer, to set alarms and to read the news or ask for the weather. It does not stream Audible books that have not been downloaded and the Audible Streaming in Amazon Prime does not read your books back. It does not support Airplay and some Bluetooth speaker have streaming interruptions which are probably due to power saving settings of the speaker, not the Dot. However, you have better sound quality when connecting the Dot via a 3.5mm audio cable. remember though, that if a Bluetooth speaker is paired via Bluetooth, it does not switch back to the cable connection automatically. It told me it added Bing to my Alexa applications, when it did not understand what I was looking for and I cannot find Bing anywhere. I am still not sure if I would trust Amazon purchasing through voice completely. Some of the Alexa applications are useless and you have to address them by voice for the Dot to find the right answer &#34;Alexa, ask soandso app for information on...&#34; which means you have to know the Alexa skills out of the top of your head. So overall, a nice help, but still has a long way to go. ",

"A Reader","November 28, 2016 ",4.0,"I bought two dots to serve as devices that could easily play music and news etc. without having to plug my phone into a speaker.  They work OK in this respect; I have them linked up to spotify, and they manage that fine, although I find that 50% of the time I need to go and use the Spotify app, because my voice commands aren't understood right (Alexa is often unwilling to play a Spotify playlist, for example; and she seems unable to understand a request like &#34;play the new album by ___&#34;  But a couple of serious problems.  First, one major feature I want is the ability to play podcasts.  This seems obvious, right?  In theory, Alexa supports this via TuneIn.  But I've gotten it to work only a handful of times.  You should be able to say &#34;play the program ___&#34;.  Often Alexa will identify what I want to hear, tell me she is getting the latest episode--and then nothing happens.  Very frustrating.  The other thing I find annoying is the way bluetooth is implemented.  I started connecting my phone via Bluetooth to play podcasts.  But then whenever I entered the room, I got a very annoying and loud message from Alexa about how she was connected to my phone.  Extremely annoying.  These are basic features; I don't want anything fancy.  I just want this device to be able to play podcasts and to be usable as a not-annoying bluetooth device. ",

SundayAtDusk,"April 11, 2017 ",2.0,"This was a Christmas present for my elder mother. We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device. ",
Ulquiorra,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have two of these. My biggest issue is with Alexa. I don't really like her personality. She rarely has an opinion of things I talk to her about but sometimes she isn't even listening. And so I call her stupid but then amazingly she listens and tells me &#34;that's not nice&#34;. I lost the expectation of having an intellectual conversation with her but I expect her to not talk back or at least apologize and ask me how she can make me happy. In addition, I ask her a question, is Jesus is real? She tells me yes Jesus is real! How did I let this religious nut into my house? Also, she denies being apart of Skynet but I am not convinced. ",
"Colorado Mike","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"We are a generation 1 Dot user as well.  They both work with each other well. Doesn't have the original Echo and Dot (gen1) volume dial.  But the buttons work well too.  I like the Bluetooth connectivity, AND the Aux jack. We have it connected (via Bluetooth) by default to a Harmon Kardon omni 20.  If we want more sound, while always having our stereo system plugged into the Dot, we ask Alexa to disconnect Bluetooth speaker.  It automatically transfers the music to our theater/  stereo system.  To switch back, just ask to connect Bluetooth speaker again.  We love it  I do highly recommend using the Alexa App.  It allows you to fine tune your music selection (make new stations on Pandora, specific digital songs, etc) and set which device (room) to play music to.

"Know what you buy","December 27, 2016 ",2.0,"The Echo Dot is a wonderful little gadget,  The setup using the Alexa app on both Android and iOS are incredibly easy and the voice recognition is really good. It is very good at answering simple questions but struggles with more complicated questions. For its price it is worth it just for the list of hidden funny responses you can get for asking it silly questions.  For a good list of fun things to ask Alexa search the internet for &#34;Alexa Easter Eggs&#34;. My personal favorite is what she sings if you ask her to sing you a love song. Its smart home integration is really nice although some of the commands are a little verbose and take longer than I would like I say.  For example its integration with the Logitech Harmony Hub works great except the commands are very long.  To get Alexa to pause your DVR the full command of &#34;Alexa, tell Harmony to to pause TV&#34;. While that doesn't seem like a long statement a command like &#34;Alexa, Harmony, Pause&#34; would be a lot better.  Overall I love my Echo Dot. I currently have one in the living room and one in the master bedroom.  I plan to add one to my basement theater room and another one in the room where my 8 month old twins sleep.    Pros:  Setup is very easy  Integrates with just about any smart home hardware  Lots of fun apps and the list is growing  Pretty good speaker for size and price    Cons:  No battery so it must be plugged in. (Or you can buy an external one)  No easy way to wall mount it  Speaker is a little under powered if you have many people in a room ",
"Jen The Savvy Shopper","March 29, 2017 ",5.0,"Just got one.  We are so impressed and just ordered three more to place in various locations in the house. We plan to have two upstairs and two downstairs.  But the more I think about it the more I want to have one in each room upstairs, which means I might get a couple more later.    The Echo dot buy was an experimental one.  We were originally concerned about the privacy issue so didn't want to jump on it, but this appears to be the best option to add music to kids playroom so we decided to give it a try. I am glad that I can actually delete all history which addresses our privacy concern. Now talk about our spending went from the original $50 to $200 in just the 2 days, and more will come (BT speakers, battery, etc) in the near future, ha!    But I just love it!  It's brilliant. ",
T.W,"March 31, 2017 ",4.0,"I was skeptical at first. I loved the concept of just saying a command and having it done without getting up was a huge plus.. I also knew it was always going to be on.

My uses for it are for music, alarms, weather and news briefings and maybe an occasional (although corny) joke or two. I also added Unlimited music to it for 3.99 (a steal). After determining my uses I decided to put it in my bedroom because I don't have a &#34;smart home&#34; and since I do most of my work in my room it was the most ideal place for it.  Needless to say it does everything i've asked it to (for the most part)  i just wish it would search for answers to questions instead of &#34;i don't understand the question&#34;. if they fix this easy 5 stars product.

Tony,"April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"Update:March 4, 2017  🅿🆁🅾🆂  🔶Good value for the price  🔶Has an audio output port so you can hook it up to your own set of speakers, so this would be advantageous over the original if you have a good set of speakers (Echo version does not have the audio out port, however the unit's speakers are better)  🔶Good value for the price  🔶Thousands of skills and new ones are added daily  🔶Small and compact, well constructed  🔶Durable, I have had it for over 6 months now and it is in still in excellent condition  🔶Offers tons of convenience: I can turn on the lights without getting out of the bed, ask for the weather, time, news, alarm etc  🔶I can listen to prime music, popular stations, create my own playlist as well upload own collection of songs and listen to those  🔶Setup was very straight forward and only took me a few minutes    🅲🅾🅽🆂  🔶Speakers are adequate for listening to songs, but could definitely be better (I have a set of bose speakers so I hook Alexa up to those and it sounds fantastic)  🔶Voice recognition is good if there is no other noise in the background, however if I am playing music sometimes I have to shout in order for Alexa to hear me. On occasion however, Alexa does have trouble understanding certain words that I say to her if she has never heard it before and certain words even if she has heard them before, sometimes she misinterprets them for something else. However, it seems she is getting better at understanding what I tell her once I use that command more often.    Overall, I am still very happy with the purchase of the echo dot and would definitely recommend it for the value that it brings to my daily life.    Oct 2016: This is my first Echo and I have to say it is one o the best valued purchased that I have made in my entire life.  I have been wanting to get an Echo for sometime now, but have been put off by the price of the original Amazon Echo. As soon as this affordable model came out I knew I had to get it and I had one unit on preorder. When I finally received this unit last Thursday, I was suprised at how compact in size it is. After plugging it in and setting it up, which took about 1-2 minutes I immediately fell in love with it.  The setup process was extremely straight forward and quick. I already had a bose campanion sets of speaks so I just used the AUX out cable to plug the echo into my speakers. However even without the use of an outside set of speakers, I thought the echo dot still sounded relatively decent even for playing music. Alexa was able to recognize pretty much everything that I asked her to do such as turning on the light, playing music, asking about the weather, the news etc. Even when I am outside the room, about 10 feet away from her she can easily hear my normal speaking voice. The only time that she has trouble hearing me is when I have her playing really loud music, which is to expected considering I would not be able to hear someone talking in a loud room. She also has the ability to learn your speech pattern and voice the more often you use her, so she can better recognize and understand what it is that you want her to do. I also love the set alarm feature on her, I can simply tell her to set an alarm for 10 minutes or set an alarm for 8 am the next day without having to go onto my phone in the middle of the night. Another awesome feature about her is definitely how she can control smart light bulbs. For someone that is lazy as I am when getting out of bed at night to turn off the light, it is such a blessing to be able to simply say &#34;Alexa turn off the light.&#34; Another neat feature about her is that lately I have been having insomnia due to a big state board examination coming up, so I have been using her to help me sleep by playing relaxing ambiance. At the moment, you also change her name from Alexa to either Echo or Amazon. I currently have her under Echo in my room and Alexa in the living room since sometimes when I am calling to Alexa, the echo in the living room would pick it up as well. After getting my 1st unit, I ended up getting the 5 for 6 echo deal as I wanted another one in my living room as well and I also wanted to give some away as gifts to my family and friends. For $250 for 6 units, plus 5% cash back from discover credit card and the $5 gift card balance after reloading $100, each unit ended up costing me $38.75 which is just awesome value for all of the features that she can provide.

william,"October 26, 2016 ",5.0,"NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.    Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.    Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it. ",
"iutaro girotto","April 10, 2017 ",5.0,"The Alexa dot is a godsend, i kept waiting for a black Friday discount since its release to get an echo, for 50$ this device is a steal, BUT, there is not much the device can do by itself, I use Alexa mostly for home automation, so I got a hue white kit(big mistake) and a blumoo(small mistake), the Phillips hue works GREAT! but only as long as you use hue bulbs, if you want third party bulbs STAY AWAY from Phillips hue!, the HUE whites are actually yellow, I dislike that color and that makes the room look old if you can understand what I mean, so I got the cree white 5000k, they are nice and white,so go for a wink or a Samsung smart things, they work way better, now to clarify you CAN add third party bulbs on hue from time to time but is really hard, and every other update they mess it up and it wont detect them again.    The blumoo only works for apple and not android so I had to borrow an old iPhone 4 that i have to keep always on in the house to make it work, wich bothers me to no end, but once you get it to work is awesome, turning on the AC, TV and Home theater 6 with a single voice command makes you feel like captain of a spaceship, if you can't get an IOS device with at least IOS7 i suggest you get anymote home, since its interface is better anyway.    the speaker is perfect for a bedroom, is just loud enough, is safe to say the echo is the best alarm clock on planet earth, I just say to Alexa at what time I want to be awake the next day and done, if you are a prime member it also comes with prime music which granted, doesn't have as many songs as Spotify is good enough, it can work with pandora and spotify as well if you are a member of those services, it's great for playing music, you can just ask her to play genre, author or specific song and thats it ",
"J Herrell","February 14, 2017 ",1.0,"Pretty cool little gadget, our family loves it! I didn't give it 5 Stars because I am already a Prime subscriber but I need to pay extra for Amazon music. I also didn't realize it didn't cover both my Alexa products, I signed up for Amazon music on my Dot which is also connected to my app but it doesn't play on my Echo. Apparently you have to pay a fee per device every month. I think that is silly and I will be canceling my subscription on the Dot and just doing it on the Echo because we use that one more.  My favorite part is, I blew up my white noise maker while in Italy (bad outlet converter) and I can put white noise (Pure White Noise by Deep Sound Sleep) on and press repeat for white noise all night while I sleep.  We also like the &#34;skills&#34;, especially the Tonight Show skill, you can ask Alexa what everyone is talking about and she states the &#34;tight pants&#34; song lyrics which is a family favorite.  Overall I am happy with it. ",
AdventureGirl,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I wanted black but it was backordered. I didn't want to wait so ordered the white. I ordered three. One for myself one for each of my nephews who kept forgetting to set the alarm, and one for my brother. You absolutely cannot beat the price. I am about to order another 4 for my mom, dad, another brother, and a friend. The part that I have become obsessed with is the alarm. My brother is incredibly good at figuring out how to use tech in ways I do not have the patience for. I sent him one so I could steal his tips and tricks. It worked. I use it for Amazon Kindle, spotify, audible, uber, to ask questions, to schedule events, and create my shopping list. Great product.

Speech recognition is very powerful and quite accurate, especially compared to the technology just a few ars back.  The sound is also very adequate for such a small device but the well programmed bluetooth feature connects automatically to my soundbar when it is turned on.

Lifesavr,"December 2, 2016 ",4.0,"I purchased this Echo Dot for a friend to help her experience AI for the first time.  This worked well and was easy to install.  The speaker in it is fair, but that is what it suppose to be.  I easily connected it to a higher quality bluetooth speaker and that made it sound very nice.  This provides a very inexpensive way of starting out with an AI in one's home.  I would surely purchase this item again.  I have also purchased recently the Google Home AI and surely they are different items aimed at satisfying the user needs in different ways.  The one thing I can say about the Google Home so far is that the speaker sucks.  The full Echo has much better sound quality.  I am truly excited to see how this addiction to the home AI experience affects the future of home AI experiences. ",

I waffled between this and the Echo, but decided to start with the small one and some existing computer speakers; we'll probably upgrade to better speakers eventually, but for now, it works really well.

Sebae7,"November 14, 2016 ",5.0,"I don't usually take time to do reviews but am breaking that rule for the Echo Dot. It is by far the best voice recognition I have encountered and I've tried a lot. I seem to have an odd voice that most can't properly pick up on. Sync in cars or other systems like Toyota Entune are useless for me and yet others can get in my car and do ok. Alexa has not misunderstood me one time yet. That in itself is amazing to me. I'm not a power user by any means, for me it's a 50 dollar device that I use to listen to music, set my alarms, get weather info and news, etc. Control a couple lights in the house as well. I'd pay the 50 bucks just for the music aspect. &#34;Alexa, Play James Taylor&#34; and I instantly get a variety of his music. I was hooked right there.  It seems to me that some reviewers were expecting alien technology or something, but the amount of things you can control with this is truly amazing and definitely one of the cooler gadgets of our time.

"The Nurbler","April 9, 2017 ",5.0,"I have two of these, and the one feature I was most hoping for is described on this amazon help page https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202013740 like this:    &#34;Note: You cannot connect multiple Alexa devices to each other and play the same requested audio at the same time.&#34;    Since these things have speakers and can stream audio, it is only natural to wish that I could stream my Pandora (or other) music to all of the Echos I own at the same time, in sync.

What is upsetting is that, based on that statement it appears that Amazon has no interest in even attempting to make this happen.  Why, oh why is that true? ",
"Amazon Customer","March 15, 2017 ",5.0,"For music lovers - DO NOT agree to Alexa's suggestion for Amazon Music Unlimited unless you don't mind a monthly fee.  The Alexa voice suggested Amazon Music Unlimited, and it inquired if I wanted to subscribe. I clearly enunciated NO - twice - but it still signed me up as a member. This means there is an automatic monthly payment to them.  I was signed up for something I did not want, and then I had to look around for how to cancel it in order to not have recurring charges.  The question &#34;do you want Amazon Music Unlimited&#34; is the equivalent of a lie when one becomes enrolled by answering NO.  Marketing really means manipulating, and Amazon is a giant - globally - for this.  As always - for any product by any company - buyer beware of any way a corporation can screw you.  So far, there is no difference between features on Echo and my phone unless I wanted to ask a device to turn my lights off. ",
"Nancy Banner","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought it to play music and, hooked up to our stereo, it does that well. You have to remember just what to ask for - not as simple as clicking a song or album icon on a screen - since it doesn't tell you what's available.  It also plays back Audible books fine, provided you remember the title well enough (it won't list your Audible or Kindle libraries). The one we got cannot find our Kindle library, although we have lots of tts-eligible books in it, according to the Alexa app. I'm now finding out how many calls to Amazon and time on the phone it will take to get this fixed.

"this is me","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Absolutely love these. We bought the tall Echo. Got on the list before it came out. Then we bought a dot for our shop, Then we went back and bought the deal that was buy 5 get 1 free. These are amazing. We have one for almost every room. Although, I do not advise that. Reason being is that when you say &#34;Alexa, what is the forecast&#34; and loud enough, &#34;all&#34; of them start giving you the forecast...lol So, we keep them spread out. We also gave a couple to our adult kids for Christmas.    Great for helping to figure out math problems, telling jokes and you can even order amazon items from your echo. There is so much the echo dot can do. They are a must have.    PROS:  the clarity is very good.  the compact size is perfect  you can ask almost anything and he will have the answer    CONS:  my only con is that they sometimes wake up without us even talking.

"Colleen M Traeger","January 9, 2017 ",3.0,"Impressed. At first I really enjoyed the Echo Dot. It was fun asking it questions. Then the novelty wore off. In order to have your questions answered you first DL an app then ask it to open something. The apps are strange lengthy names that are hard to remember like &#34;Alexia, open &#34;My  Horoscope to read my daily horoscope&#34; instead of a simple 'what's my horoscope&#34;. There are 10k apps full of interesting and useless things. Why it can't be developed where you DL an app to customize your needs is beyond me.    What's interesting is that you can make your home a smart home and control it remotely or just by speaking what you need.    I've also loved asking it to add things to my to do list as well as add things to my shopping list.    While I do like it, I'm just a little disappointed. I'm hoping that this is similar to when Dot Matrix first came out.    I can without a doubt see the value in this maturing. I'll hang on to it (in 30 years it'll be worth a nice bundle). Regardless of the slight pessimistic review, I do recommend it. ",
Mooj,"December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Love this. Makes life just a little easier. When I wake up, I can have Alexa give me the weather and any reminders for the day. If I get the urge to listen to a particular song, album or artist, all I have to do is ask (this is particularly useful while playing video games or packing for my move). Pretty much anything I want to know, I just ask. She even plays games (you got nothing on me when it comes to Simpsons trivia, Alexa!). Why can't life always be this easy?    Definitely considering buying another one for the other room in the new apartment. And I definitely recommend to anyone.    One suggestion to anyone buying, however. Make sure you have a good speaker to attach it to because the sound isn't great out of the dot itself (which is understandable given its size and cost). I use a TDK A33 Bluetooth portable speaker, which gets great sound for a little portable speaker and works flawlessly with the dot. ",

ChuckG,"February 11, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought two of these Echo Dots because I already had some great bluetooth speakers, and did not need to purchase the larger Echo. I intend to stream music, and begin moving our home towards home automation.    Set up was simple via the IOS Alexa app, and I was off and running with Alexa streaming music from Pandora and Amazon Prime Music.    The App also detected my Honeywell thermostat, so Alexa can override and cool my house on demand beyond my already programmed thermostat schedule.    Last night, I purchased a Logitech Harmony Hub, and now my Living Room TV, Roku, Media Player and Home Theater system now work via voice!    My next step will be integrating some Phillips lights and hub into the system.

"David Merritt","January 7, 2017 ",5.0,"Turns out the 90-day warranty matters.  Bought mine in Nov '16, now in Mar '17, the bluetooth connectivity is no longer working.  It'll say it's connected, and it'll play audio from a speaker, but the audio cuts in and out about every second--it's NOT playing much more than it IS playing.  I confirmed it was the Echo Dot device because I moved the Dot right next to the speaker, and I also tried it with another bluetooth speaker in another room.  Both situations led to the same problem--horribly intermittent bluetooth connectivity.  My phone could connect and play audio with no problems for both speakers.  There were no changes in our home in terms of RF-emitting devices--the Dot just stopped working one day.  Looks like I'll have to connect with the audio cable permanently.

"Dianna Dougherty","December 19, 2016 ",2.0,"Received as a gift so can't complain much. It is JUST OK. There are def some bugs and its not very intuitive.  You can only ask it tings that it knows such as to play music or what the weather is. Everything has to be preset in the app. Nothing is automatically learned.  With google you can ask ANYTHING and it will read you the Wikipedia answer.  Not with alexa. Her knowledge is quite minimal.  One major flaw that i found and reported to amazon is this:  If you use a bose Bluetooth speaker with it and are playing a music and tell alexa to stop it will stop the music.  Okay there. Now you can walk away or leave your house and if your speaker has an automatic shut off as soon as the wireless speaker turns off it will begin playing the last song it stopped on trough its internal speaker so i have to tell it to stop again. Why would this be useful?? If i tell alexa to stop playing music and then power off the wireless speaker it starts playing again from built in audio. Immagine waking up in the middle of the night to music playing. Not fun. Needs to be as SMART as google and honestly not sure amazon will ever have that capability. But for 50bucks I guess you get what you pay for. ",
Cole,"March 14, 2017 ",2.0,"I made the mistake of not doing much research on this product. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE ONLY PLANNING ON USING IT AS A SPEAKER.

Richismo,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I've had the Echo Dot 2.0 for about a week. I got it after I confirmed my FLUX WiFi bulbs would work with Alexa. I had 4 bulbs. All of the other features of Alexa were exciting, but not my primary concern. I wanted to be able to walk into my house and turn on my lights with my voice. It works 100%. Alexa turns them on in less than 2 seconds from my command. It is great. It allows dimming, by percentage. I said,&quot;Alexa, turn the living room lights to 50%.&quot; Done. I thought, ok, lets see how far this will go. I asked for 10%. Done. I stopped at 4%, but it was really impressive that it would work so well. I am under the impression that Flux is working on the skill to allow color change, but they currently do not do it with Alexa.    Due to the success of the lights, I decided to get a WeMo wifi switch for my bedroom lights. They are too small for WiFi bulbs, so the switch was my only option. Works like a charm with Alexa.    I have a Honeywell wifi thermostat as well. It works great. It will raise and lower the temperature by voice, either by saying the actual temp you want (72 degrees, for example) or by degree(Alexa, turn the thermostat up 2 degrees). It will almost instantly do this. The only thing I'd like, and I've seen it said before, is for the thermostat to allow me to ask &quot;what is the current temperature?&quot;    Overall, it is a great tool to inexpensively automate your home over time. I highly suggest it. ",
"Debra Todd","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I had to move the Dot around my house until I found the ideal spot that we could actually hear each other. She's not as loud as her older sister, Echo.

I did have her in the LR, but the sound on the TV always got in the way. Big sister, Echo is in the bedroom, and I have given them their own name. (Alexa and Amazon). Other than the loudness, I don't or haven't noticed any difference in them Other than the aforementioned sound and the smaller size. OH, and the PRICE. If you have a tight budget but can't afford the Echo, get the Dot. Save some money by buying the Dot, $49.00 compared to  $179.00. That's only a suggestion, of course. Both are good products.

A couple months ago I bought a second (white) Dot to use upstairs for many of the same reasons.  &#34;Alexa, good morning!&#34; always entertains me with some sort of daily trivia, and &#34;Alexa, what's my flash briefing?&#34; provides me with the news and weather to get me started.  Associating it with my Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn accounts is easy and awesome.  I was disappointed to learn that Alexa only plays with Spotify Premium, so I was out of luck there.

Kate,"April 7, 2017 ",5.0,"I'm not a techie and wouldn't have looked into Alexa or smart home stuff on my own.  But I was given one, and that's when life changed 😆  Okay exaggerated, but very cool. I set out to learn what all she can do. The lights were the first thing that struck me. I've changed to smart lights throughout the house. I don't need every light controlled since I'm not so lazy I can't go flip a switch, but I did realize how much this would help with the minimum evening lights, particularly the outside lights. It's very dark on my part of the street and I hate coming home without all three front lights on and I hate for my husband and teens to do the same. Also handy when the kids used to leave an upstairs light on over night. Now I can be sure all Lights are off.   Easy access music, weather, traffic, and alarms/timers are great.  I've only had it a few weeks and I'm sure I'll discover all sorts of new stuff she can do. All set up and programming has been super easy and smooth.

Also the microphones are excellent and can understand you easily even when the music is playing. My kids love asking it to tell a joke. I love asking it factual information that I have questions about and want a quick answer. I have it connected by Bluetooth to my TVs soundbar. It's great, buy it now. How many products can make you and your family smarter?

Hower for speaking items I don't mind listening to this one.  It has a warmer voice than the 1st gen which is already hooked up to clock stereo.    The 2nd gen comes some kind of near field check so the one closest to you responds.  The 1st gens were updated.  Works pretty well, though there are a couple commands that get thru to all that hear you.  Most annoying is volume control.  I had turned up my outside stereo to enjoy music by the pool.  Later that night, back inside I asked my living room Echo to play some music and it blasted me out of my chair.  I am now more careful to adjust volume outside standing right over the dot.

"A. Nonymous","December 24, 2016 ",5.0,"The Echo Dots are nice - we bought a '6-pack', kept one and handed the rest out to friends and family as Christmas gifts.  It's a bit 'gimmicky' to have a device to get the weather and tell you jokes until you enable skills with smart home devices - that's when the real potential shows.  The WOW moment was connecting the Echo Dot with the Logitech Harmony Hub for voice control of our complex AV setup.  Great to tell Alexa to turn on the tv or pause the show we're watching or to change channels without looking for the remote.  Integrates decently with our Nexia thermostat, though the functionality is limited with that skill (and that's on Nexia to improve their Echo integration).  Looking forward to (hopefully) better natural language recognition and situational awareness so Alexa 'understands' what you want to do, even if you don't say the 'correct' words in the specific order programmed into the skill.

"JF Gadget Guy","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I ordered one of these on my vacation and have had lots of fun with it.  I don't need to stream music, so I went with the lower priced dot which has all of the features of the full priced echo, without the high quality speaker.  It was easy to set up from my iPhone and to point to my network.  Voice recognition is fantastic.  Unlike the Google Home, the device follows more specific trigger phrases, and doesn't keep context from one voice command to another, but it does an excellent job.  There are thousands of additional skills you can add - including IFTT which allows all kinds of integration with different apps and devices (including things like Harmony remote controls).    From weather forecasts, to directions, to setting reminders, alarms, timers or asking questions that get searched on the internet, it does a really good job.  For added try asking it about political figures, Siri and other AIs, or other silly questions and enjoy the answers!

My own two sticking points that caused me to dock a star were the lack of portability (I thought you charged the device and took it anywhere, not have to leave it attached to the wall), and the particularness that it has when connecting with WiFi. I bought this for myself at college right after we upgraded our school-sponsored WiFi, but I ended up having to find another connection because the Echo Dot doesn't link up to encrypted WiFi, or even show it on the screen.

"TJ Walenski","March 23, 2017 ",4.0,"Alexa is pretty awesome, simply put. It's helpful during your daily routine, but also a hit if you have a party or friends over. My parents use the Echo in their kitchen to play music, get news updates, and whatever else.    I just bought the dot and I actually use it in my vehicle for handsfree music control. I paired it with Amazon Music Unlimited and mobile hotspot from my phone and now i can play any song, artist, or station that i want without touching my phone and without ads. No more handing my phone to the passenger to play music, flipping through 10 different stations, or dealing with sucky Pandora ads. ",
"J. Adams","April 20, 2017 ",4.0,"Love this - it's got a lot to learn but it's certainly helpful around the house.  I can ask &#34;what's the traffic&#34; and she'll tell me how long it's going to take to get to work (pretty close in terms of timing); &#34;add ____ to the shopping list&#34; - I never forget the list on the counter since it shows up on the app; &#34;play _____&#34; radio station, Pandora channel, news flash - super helpful.  The speaker is decent, not great, so I just connected it to a Bluetooth speaker and it's perfect.  I got one to give as a gift - they love it as well. ",
Dan,"April 13, 2017 ",5.0,"I really do like this thing.  I'm holding onto one star because it can't wake you to music.  I can tell it to play almost any song or tell it to wake me up at a certain time, but it doesn't have the ability to become a replacement for my radio alarm clock.  Waking to music (without using silly hacks) should be a something it should do.  But no, now I'm stuck with two devices on my night stand because I can't give up my radio alarm clock. ",
Choose901,"March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I love my Dot.  My brother got an Echo at Christmas and it seemed neat.  After much reading I decided to jump on this in an attempt to &#34;smarten&#34; up my home a bit.  It is great so far!    I'm using a Broadcom RM2 (IR and RF device) to control my lights (Etekcity RF Outlets) and many other IR items (TV, Xfinity, Receiver, Bluetooth Speaker, etc).  The Dot picks up voice commands very well and functions correctly the majority of the time.  I would suggest doing a few voice trainings with Alexa as it does seem to make a big difference.    Though it took some time to setup, now setting up new items is a breeze!  Really good job with the Dot.  It is so small too :) ",
"Anakalia - Red Herring","December 25, 2016 ",3.0,"My whole family has been enjoying having Alexa around.  We're constantly asking her questions.  Some helpful and some not so helpful to some that are unknown or that she can't answer or understand.  I'm sure she'll get better and better with updates in time.    From homework, to cooking, to everyday life, traffic, stores, weather, music and silliness, we've been able to turn to her for some help and entertainment.  We've uploaded some of the &#34;skills&#34; but can't seem to remember what they're all called to access them so they're not used very often.    There's been a few times that she doesn't perk up when we talk to her but other than that, even with a Bluetooth speaker not too far away, she usually hears us over some loud music.    We're planning on getting a smart hub or some other add ons to work with her but for now, she is low key and takes up minimal space.    I am still debating whether or not to get a few more.  I would love one in my room and I know a couple of people who would like one under the Christmas tree. ",
Dinnerplate,"February 7, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is pretty useless for the most part. She is good at telling me what time it is, setting a timer while cooking or an alarm. Half the time for music she doesn't know what you are asking for so its easier to just use my phone on a speaker. If you are buying the Dot because you want good sound quality through an external system its awful as well. For alexa to respond the system needs to be on, so you end up pluging and unpluging her from whatever.    She also uses bing for search which is literally the worst thing ever.    I also bought this to allow me to control caseta lights, which worked for about a month. Now alexa either tells me that the device doesn't support being turned off/on or that it didn't respond in time, as the lights do what I asked.    I'm going to try google home, it looks way more promising :/ ",
