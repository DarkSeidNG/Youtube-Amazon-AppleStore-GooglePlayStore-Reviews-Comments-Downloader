"Roy Estaris","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.  Happy Holidays  Roy ",
DJ,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.    If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!    Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.    1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.    2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.    3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, &#34;Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees&#34; got no result, so I tried &#34;Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees&#34; and she picked it up perfectly.    4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.    5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  &#34;Alexa, play 90s music&#34;, &#34;Alexa, play indie music&#34;, and &#34;Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds&#34;.  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great &#34;freebie&#34; if you're a prime member.    6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.    7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.    8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to &#34;Alexa, what's the definition of&#34;, &#34;Alexa, how far away is&#34;, &#34;Alexa, Wikipedia&#34; (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask &#34;Alexa, tell me more&#34;).  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.    9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).    Suggestions for Improvement:    1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like &#34;How far away is the sun&#34; but I'd really like too see Amazon add a &#34;search&#34; function.    2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.    3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings. ",
"Bryant R.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.  A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.  So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.  The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.  I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.  Thanks for letting me rant ",
RaVen,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!  This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say &#34;alexa&#34; and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.    We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its &#34;multi-room voice recognition&#34; technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word &#34;alexa&#34; on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a &#34;multi-device&#34; plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited      The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.  The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.    At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is &#34;alexa turn on the lights&#34; and our downstairs lights spring into action.    My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with &#34;sorry I didn't get that&#34;  Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.    Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your &#34;free&#34; music.    I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up &#34;New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing&#34; under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.    I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device. ",
"Brian C","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.    I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.    My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo &#34;skills&#34; that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the &#34;skills&#34; not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.    Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.    The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached. ",
Andrew,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"This was my first Echo purchase and I am overall very pleased with it's performance. Initially, I was worried that it was going to be a Siri knockoff with only a limited number of voice commands and functions with constant errors; however, I have not received single error response since I have owned it. I am an Amazon Prime member and from the time I clicked confirm purchase to the time it was delivered to my doorstep only took 3 days, and best part of all, shipping was free.    I currently have mine sitting by my bed and have synced it with the app, available on for all phone types, which allows me to carry out a number of voice commands including: &#34;Alexa, set an alarm for..., check the weather, play Pandora, or tell me a joke.&#34; The app interface is a little clunky at times, but you're able to see the history of recent requests, and Alexa is constantly learning and adapting to your specific commands and style.    If you are looking to buy an Echo Dot because you want a cheap introduction into Bluetooth connectivity with household lights, televisions, gaming systems, thermostats, or other Echo products then buy this Echo Dot. I am working with a grad student budget, and for $50 dollars this sleek and sexy &#34;command station&#34; was worth every penny. I did not receive any compensation for this review, I am writing it because I debated on buying one for about a week before pulling the trigger, and I just want to speed up the process for people like me who may be waffling...trust me, its completely worth the $50.

"Amazon Customer","December 14, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly, I love mine but obviously, there are some things that could be better. What do I love about it? Both my boyfriend and I downloaded the app and have access to a shopping list that we can both use at the grocery store depending on who is there. With a simple wake up word (her name) and the command of adding an item to the shopping list, it appears in the app. I can ask for a flash briefing and NPR news is retrieved and I am caught up all over the world in subjects from politics all the way to sports news. She also gives great weather information so that I am able to plan for my day ahead. Alexa can learn many skills that continue to evolve. Knowledge from what wines to pair with what meats and good cooking substitutes to helping with a drinking game and other games & trivia. Alexa comes in handy when I need a hands-free timer in the kitchen or an alarm for a nap. Now, what I don't really like but can get passed it once I get the hang of it. Sometimes you ask a question but she doesn't understand the question but you reword the question and she is able to understand it. So just be sure your wording the question correctly. Also, remember that Alexa is always listening. ",
"Kathryn H.","March 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Love the Echo Dot. I got the buy 3 discount, which makes it worth while. I am sure there will be more things added and improved on in time, but so far it is a bit limited in what I can use it for. We don't have a modern set up in our house so that it can adjust lights or temp so that part is useless to us.  I got it mostly for my 93 year old mother whom I take care of, as she constantly asks me what day or time it is, so now she can ask the Echo. I also like the ability to get a weather report for the day, and I still need to set up the calendar for daily events for mom, once I get that set up it will be another great advantage in having this. I hope they can come up with a way to make this an intercom also between rooms so that if she needs me at any time Echo can alert me in some way. That alone would make this a really great item worth five stars.  So far my favorite feature is the radio, I just ask it to play a particular type of music and it comes on. You do have to be specific about how to get the type of music you want to hear rather than just ask it to play a particular genre. I also like that you can vocally tell it to turn down or up the volume, and to skip the song playing and it goes to the next one. I don't use it to shop with, might be helpful to some. Also, it does take a little adjusting to the way some people speak, my voice is clear but moms is a little muffles so it took a few times of asking questions to get it use to her voice, now it works good for her. The distance to where it can hear you is good and volume on answering and music is great, you don't really need added speakers unless you want to hear it over a very large room, or whole house.  Pros: Received quickly with free Prime shipping, ability to play music, ask for date, time, and weather without touching anything, get answeres to a lot of questions, and the ability to update and improve over time. Volume is great for small to medium size rooms, and several feet away form it. Great price for 3.  Cons: Still some limitations, no intercom set up yet, need to be specific about where to get radio from. ",
Vince,"April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I have the regular Echo and it's amazing. I bought the Echo Dot for my dad who had been using a little antenna radio around the house. This isn't mobile but it allows him to play Pandora or just to tell it what kind of music to play. It was purchased through my account but I created an Amazon account for him so I could link Pandora to it. That way he has his own Pandora account. Echo can switch accounts at any time with a voice command but we keep them on the primary users' account. I was worried the audio quality wouldn't be any good based on reviews but it's really not bad at all if you're replacing a little radio. It's not audiophile fill the room with brilliance quality, but it gets the music out and doesn't sound tinny or anything. My dad really enjoys it. ",
"Marquino Gadget guru","April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"This is what I`ve been waiting for!!!!  It is simple amazing what you can do with technology nowadays, Amazon is always innovating and staying on top with technology.  This new Amazon Echo Dot does what it says it does and provides all the necessary information by simply asking!  We like it to much i got a second device to add it in my room, been able to connect to your Bluetooth speakers and devices you can automate lots of things.  Great job Amazon ",
Aphonic,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"The far field mic in the second gen do the is way better than the full size echo.  Now if they could just use a source for weather that was even remotely accurate I'd be happy.  Accuweather is ten degrees off a tank my location always. Minimum.  The dot works well.  It's a good cheap way to get alexa.  The speaker quality is fine for audio books and news briefings. Not for music.  It seems faster to respond than the full size echo (1st generation). I believe it's a better option to buy this and pair a nice bt speaker than buy the full echo st this point.  One star off for missing some basic features.  Like accurate weather and basic google searching.  It's useful for my home automation but I still  Find the echo line of products of very limited use outside of that.  Good for a kitchen timer or wake up  Alarm.  Good for some news.  Needs much better podcast management to be very useful.  Oh yah. And accurate weAther.  Amazon prime music is a. Nice touch as is music unlimited for the echo at $3.99 a month. ",
"LUCY  Von","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I got Dot about a week after the big Echo from my son as a gift. We set her up and all was fine. Until nothing eas fine anymore 😢 . She would respond initially, but not always though, and when she was playing music she would not respond to the wake word. At all. I reset, few times, but nithing worked. I called Amazon. Within minutes they had me connected to Echo's tech support, and in no time did we have Dot fixed. They reset her factory settings with me. We tested and now our darling little Dot is happy and healthy! So call Amazon if you do have issues, it's a matter of setup or wifi or in any case, something that they can fix. Wonderful support for a wondrful device. I do wish I could call her Dot though. Or a name that I choose. Because now I have two Alexa's in one household 🤔, and calling her Echo or Amazon ain't gonna work for me 😢. Please vote my review up if you liked it. ",
"Kindle Customer","April 20, 2017 ",4.0,"EDIT: All thanks to Amazon's customer service, I learned why my Echo was not working. It must be 8&#34; -12&#34; away from a wall. Our Echo Dot works when against an interior wall but not against an exterior wall where it had previously been situated. We adore &#34;Alexa&#34; and hope the Echo Dot will soon add a great speaker to its features. For the price, this is a fantastic device. And, it's diminutive size makes it easy to use. Still, our family prefers full-size Echo. Thanks, Amazon for the email help with Echo Dot!  *****  We are an Amazon device family. And, with the exception of this device, have had wonderful experiences.    Echo Dot remains connected until the next time I use it. Literally, I reconnect Echo Dot to our network, ask it a few questions, play some music, walk away. When I return Echo has spontaneously disconnected itself and requires the reconnection procedure again.    We have two full size Echos and have no connection issues with them. They operate flawlessly. ",
"Lantana Al","January 11, 2017 ",5.0,"Amazon Echo is a great device (I was one of the first to have one and waiting for months for my first Echo to ship as Amazon vastly underestimated the demand for a device like this) and the Echo Dot (2nd generation) is fantastic in its size and capability (I bought a six pack to get one free). There is no volume ring on the 2nd gen Dot like there is on the original Echo and the 1st gen Echo Dot but it's no big deal as there are volume buttons now and the cost of the volume ring wasn't worth it if you ask me (it was nice, but for most people not worth the money). Most of the time you'll want to adjust the volume by voice anyway (like &#34;Alexa volume 5&#34;). The 2nd gen Echo Dot is also available in white but I'm sticking with black. UPDATE: I actually prefer the cheaper volume buttons on the Dot 2 to the volume ring now.    The fact that you can just talk from across the room and it can hear you (most of the time) really sets this apart. If you think you already have an Echo because you have Siri, Cortana, or Google, then know that it's just not the same.    Things I do: set timers, set alarms, get weather info, ask basic questions, listen to music (like Prime Music, Prime Stations, songs I bought, etc), listen to radio, ask for jokes, turn things on and off, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some things. The Echo really excels at playing music. I love it than I can ask for a song I want to hear and it will play it (most of the time anyway). At night I often listen to a local radio station and I just say &#34;Alexa stop&#34; without having to get out of bed when I want to stop listening.    When I listen to Prime Station I can tell it &#34;thumbs up&#34; if I like the song or &#34;thumbs down&#34; if I don't... and when I listen to the station again it won't play the songs that I've thumbed down.    Using the built-in speaker, the sound quality is decent for voice. For music you'll want to connect it to a speaker system because the Dot's small internal speaker is weak. I do wish I could AirPlay to a device from the Echo when I'm playing music and want the best sound quality, however Bluetooth is pretty impressive when it uses the near-CD quality codecs.    Positives:  * The new feature that Amazon added (ESP - Echo Spatial Perception) so that the nearest Echo responds is fantastic. I was also very happy to hear that the first generation Echoes will also support this in the next firmware update (I think devices are updating now). From my research, if the Echo app shows that you have a device software version greater than 4008 then you should have the update with ESP support. Unfortunately there does seem to be a minor downside: the Echo's response can sometimes be slightly delayed while multiple Echoes figure out which Echo is closest and should respond.  * It seems to hear better when playing music than the first gen. It was annoying when you would try to talk to it while it was playing but it couldn't hear you. The new Dot hears better during music playback but it's still not &#34;Star Trek quality&#34; hearing; sometimes you may still need to raise your voice.  * It's relatively cheap and well worth the asking price.  * It has a 3.5mm stereo audio jack, which I use with two of my Dots to connect to the line-in on one of my computers and another to the line-in on an old compact stereo/CD player. Sound quality should be good enough for anyone except audiophiles.  * Some people complain of connection issues, but all of my Echoes stay connected without issue to my&nbsp;Asus RT-AC68U&nbsp;router.  * If you want to 'Wikipedia' something then you can say 'Alexa, Wikipedia &#60;subject&#62;'. She'll read a little from Wikipedia. If you want her to read more after she stops then just say 'Alexa, tell me more'. This can be useful sometimes.    Negatives (mostly minor but take note):  * Warranty is only 90 days. I think it should be 1 year. Of course they will sell you a SquareTrade 1, 2, or 3 year warranty for $5/year if you want. Perhaps another cost-cutting move.  * The shiny (glossy) black surface can be a fingerprint magnet but you probably won't be touching it often. The previous generation wasn't glossy.  * I had trouble configured my 2nd Echo Dot (the first one went fine). The Alexa app (on Android) gave me the cryptic message &#34;Authorization expired. Please reconnect your phone to the internet, log out from the app and retry&#34;. Got it several times. I resolved it by signing out of the Alexa app and then signing back in, having to re-enter my email and password.... annoying... and I wonder why I didn't have this issue setting up my first Echo Dot just minutes prior???? Oh well. UPDATE: This just happened again on another day when setting up two more Echo Dots. This first Echo Dot setup went fine, but on the second one I got the &#34;Authorization expired.&#34; message again. Beware of this issue if setting up more than one Echo Dot.  * While trying out Amazon Music Unlimited with the Echo I immediately ran into the issue of the Echo playing the explicit version of songs instead of the clean version. There should be an option to never play explicit songs and to play the clean version instead (some people have children). The workaround until Amazon addresses this problem is to add the clean song to your music library and then say &#34;Alexa play &#60;song&#62; from my library&#34;.  * This doesn't affect me, but the Echo does not support enterprise networks that require centralized network authentication with a login. Some might want to know this (like teachers who might want to use it in a school that uses this type of network authentication).  * The Android Amazon Alexa app can be slow and frustrating sometimes. For example, when launching it sometimes just sits there on the intro screen and spins forever until you shut down the app and restart it again.  * Doesn't hear well in a noisy environment, or when other people (including on TV) are talking at the same time.    Home Automation:  * I use several&nbsp;Belkin WeMo&nbsp;switches to control some lights and fans. They work pretty well although not always perfectly. Fortunately they work better now after all the firmware updates.  * I can control my Honeywell WiFi thermostats using the &#34;Honeywell Total Connect Comfort&#34; skill. I have two downstairs for 2 zones. I have one&nbsp;Honeywell RTH9580WF1005/W1&nbsp;and one&nbsp;Honeywell RTH6580WF.  * I recently set it up to turn on and off certain activities with a&nbsp;Logitech Smart Hub. For example, I can say &#34;Alexa, turn on TiVo&#34; and it will turn on the TV and my receiver and set the TV and receiver inputs correctly. I can then use the remote which is synced... and turn it all off with &#34;Alexa turn off TiVo&#34;. There were some annoyances getting it all setup but I think it's pretty &#34;cool&#34; even though you can only start and stop activities with Alexa so you still need the remote to do other things (change channel, adjust volume, mute, pause, etc).  * I think I've only really scratched the surface of what is possible with home automation. I have not tried IFTTT (&#34;if this then that&#34;) recipes yet but I hear it is quite powerful and hope to try it out when I have more time to &#34;play&#34;.    Wishes:  * High-quality digital audio output that is better than Bluetooth. If it had this then you could really get high quality audio output from it, but most people probably don't really care that much as analog out is &#34;good enough&#34;.  * Smarter. After 2 years I wish the Echo was smarter. Yes, it has definitely improved over time but Google can still answer more questions than Alexa. It's going to be hard to beat Google in answering general questions.  * Weather alerts. I suggested this a long time ago and they still haven't added it... perhaps due to legal reasons? If would be great if it would sound some sort of alarm or notification for severe weather.  * Built-in support for notifying others that you might need help. This would be good for the elderly. There is a &#34;Ask My Buddy&#34; skill however, but the verbiage is a little awkward (&#34;Alexa, Ask My Buddy to Send Help&#34;) and it's free so if the developer decides to stop support then that might leave a lot of people without service at an inopportune time.    Compared to Google Home (which I just bought):  * Setup on Google Home was super-simple, easier than Echo (the Android app worked really well and setup seemed streamlined)  * Google Home is smarter for general questions... significantly smarter. I asked Google &#34;How long does it take to get to the Honda dealer in Lewisville&#34; and it told me about 26 minutes in current traffic conditions. Awesome. The Echo totally failed here.  * No AUX audio output like on Echo Dot  * I prefer saying &#34;Alexa&#34; to &#34;OK Google&#34; as the wake word (UPDATE: &#34;Hey Google&#34; works now too!)  * I currently prefer Echo for music and smart home control but I consider Google Home a serious threat to Echo because it is more &#34;intelligent&#34; than Echo    Other:  * It doesn't come with a 3.5mm audio cable but I can understand why as many people would probably not use it and Amazon wants to get the cost as low as possible so this isn't a big deal.  * The USB power cable is about 5 feet.  * The 1st gen Echo Dot was almost double the price. I feel a little disappointed that they now have a 2nd gen that is overall better for much less money... and that it came out very shortly after the 1st gen Echo Dots.  * You don't need any other Echo units to use the Dot... some people might think you do but this is just like the &#34;big Echo&#34;, only without the &#34;big&#34; sound. Instead a little speaker is included.  * It's USB powered and comes with a USB power adapter and USB cable. NOTE: If you use a USB power connection other than from the included power adapter then there could be power and/or sound quality issues. I had some sound quality issues (background noises) and eliminated them by switching to the included USB power adapter.  * About 10 or 15 minutes after setting it up, it said something like &#34;your Echo received an important update and must restart&#34;. So if you are having issues with it then you may want to give it awhile so it can update if needed.  * For better understanding of what you say, go to the Alexa app and Settings-&#62;Voice Training.  * I bought some of these powered bookshelf speakers, hooked them to the Echo Dot, and have been impressed with what you get for the money:&nbsp;Edifier R1280T Powered Bookshelf Speakers    While not perfect, I really like the Amazon Echo. I think the technology and potential is still in its infancy but the Echo is already really useful and excels at home automation, playing music, podcasts, and radio. Highly recommended, especially for the price. UPDATE: I'm reducing my rating from 4.5 to 4 stars due to Google Home being much smarter at answering general questions. The Echo is a good device but I think you should also seriously consider Google Home. ",
Artemaria,"April 13, 2017 ",4.0,"At first, I thought that this would just be like a voice-controlled Siri that is always on, but  after living with it for several months it seems as if it is so much more.  While not perfect, the speech recognition and accuracy are on a par with Google Assistant, and that accuracy along with the &#34;instant on&#34; feature is what makes this so easy to use.  The literature is not the clearest on this, but you don't really need a speaker for the Echo Dot, and we usually don't use it with the speaker, because the built in speaker is more than loud and clear enough for Alexa's speaking voice in the 20 x 16 room where we have it stationed.  If you want to play music and have the music sound rich and full, then you should hook it up to a nice Bluetooth speaker.  We use the Logitech Boom and it works very well, usually pairing flawlessly with the Echo Dot with very little effort, and great sound.    What makes the Echo Dot a little different and perhaps more fun to use than its competitors are the &#34;skills&#34; that are built into it.  I'm not going to go into the details of all the things that it can do because you can read about them on c/net or some other tech site, but what I will tell you is that there are alot of &#34;skills&#34; that are not at all pragmatic or useful, but that make the Echo Dot/Alexa alot more fun than the competition.  There's a storytelling feature, where Alexa will tell you a not so great bedtime story.  But what makes it so engaging are the thoughtfully interspersed comments in that story, such as &#34;no, you can't get any water,&#34; and &#34;that's your last story, and its time for you to go to sleep,&#34; which seem so human and so clever.  The Echo Dot/Alexa also will tell you the news, the weather and instantaneously provide any other current-events related information that you may want to hear while cooking dinner or getting dressed for work.    Along, these same lines, Alexa will tell you a joke, and will answer questions about various topics including about other AI platforms which she does in a polite and diplomatic fashion with a response like &#34;I like all AIs.&#34;  In reality, however, this is not true.  Neither Alexa, nor Google Assistant, nor Siri are true AIs.  They are merely the latest in voice recognition hardware and software that, through brute force algorithm calculations performed on a server far from your home, determines a high-probability acceptable response to the combination of words that served as its verbal input.  Because Alexa is cannot make any decisions on its own, it is not a true AI.  Thus, if your internet service is slow or off, Alexa will not work, leaving you with a $50 paperweight.  We've not had that issue, but it is something to consider if your internet service is not the best and you are considering buying this device.    In the end, this is a fun foray in to the world of voice-activated assistants.  And while Amazon's database of verbal input grows, paving the way for a true AI someday, Alexa may be the recognized as one of the first pioneering digital assistant devices that trained people to verbally interact with technology in their home.

NC-Ron,"October 24, 2016 ",4.0,"My wife and I had thought about getting Dots for the grand kids for Christmas but the reviews at that time were incomplete and confusing about what the dot would do and how they might interact/interfere with each other in the same household.  Well, we now own an Echo, a Tap and two Dots. They are all great.    Myth 1.  You do NOT need Echo to use a Dot. Dot is autonomous. It responds to Alexa commands just like Echo, and can control remote devices just as well.    Myth 2. You MUST have external speakers. Not so. The speaker in Dot is no great shakes, but it works. The audio output to a good set of powered speakers is great.    Myth 3. If you use Echo, or Dot or Tap, you cannot have two or more doing different things. Not so. I can have Alexa via Echo playing Clapton in the living room and have Alexa via Dot playing the Dead in the bedroom, at the same time, with just one Amazon Prime account, not even the Prime Music account.    Other:  Both Dot and Echo have to be plugged into 115 v all the time to work. The Tap is rechargeable and bluetooth so it is portable. Great feature. We use Echo and Dot to control TP-Link smart plugs and smart switches. They work great. (I love the TP-Link stuff, maybe another review. But Alexa at my house can control the smart stuff at our beach place 250 miles away. In fact you have to be precise in your language with Alexa or she'll be turning stuff on and off in the other location...)    I actually haven't tried the Tap yet with remotes (it's at the beach and I'm not), but I assume it will work just as well. The only caveat is that you have to 'enable remote' on the smart plugs, etc. in order to have Alexa turn them on and off. Some folks are leery about doing that. If I get hacked and some clown wants to turn off my bedroom light, so be it. (I can monitor the status of all the smart devices with the KASA app for TP-Link and my smart phone.)    Dot is a little bigger than a hockey puck and makes a great alarm clock. ",
ComputerGuy,"April 26, 2017 ",5.0,"For $50 and what it does, how can you go wrong? Answer is, you can't. This thing is awesome. Not a whole lot bigger than a hockey puck. With all the power of the Full Sized Echo less the better speaker. Since you can pair with a Blue Tooth Speaker or plug it in via cable which the full unit currently doesn't, there's really no downside to this thing. Setup in minutes, new skills easily added. 2 Million songs available if you have Amazon Prime. I've got it controlling a Smart LED Bulb I purchased a few days after I received the Echo Dot. I purchased a second one for my brother who's Bed Ridden in a care facility and he loves it. He's a Trivia and Facts Buff so he went to town using it to search Wikipedia for all sorts of info. He's also using it to play his favorite Radio Station.    If you are interested in this device, ignore the low rating reviews. The speaker is fine, yes it's small and not super powerful but there is no quality issue with it. It's like using a small portable radio (not a boombox). If you're an Audiophile or need loud music, hook it up to a stereo or high end Bluetooth speaker, don't trash it because it won't shake your windows with the built in speaker.    It's sound pickup is fine as well. I put one upstairs in my house and it can hear me from other rooms upstairs just fine. Unless you are talking like a mouse or have it blasting music or something making it hard for it to pickup your voice. I purchased a second for my downstairs part of the house and with it centrally located, I've got the entire house covered with 2 and it's always within range of my voice. My Girlfriend has a slight speech issue and it understands her fine too.    I may buy a 3rd to dedicate to my Home Entertainment center and plug it into the stereo. I should have purchased 3 with the promotion of getting $20 for buying 3, but I wanted to test one out first. In any case, even without the Buy 3 promotion, you still come in under the $176 for the Full echo. I don't have the full Echo so I can't compare, but from everything I've read, and what i've experienced with my Dots, I see nothing wrong with them and feel they are a major margin. And I don't feel the need to get the full unit at this point just to have a better speaker. ",
Manders,"March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"I like the Dot quite a bit, but it could be better. I'm not sure if it is the ALEXA program that the Dot connects to or if it is the Bing Search engine, I will have to do some more testing. Some times it can't find info it should be able to. Playing Music works Great!!! The Built in speaker is OK. But if you connect it to a really good speaker with either an Audio Cable or Bluetooth it sounds Great!! I am having the Dot read a Kindle book to me. It works well but the inflections in the text to speech program need work. However that is not a limitation of the device but of current technology. Getting local weather or movies works well. Alexa can &#34;learn&#34; other &#34;Skills&#34; but you have to tell Alexa to use the skill. It would be better if these skills were available all the time, and didn't have to be &#34;turned on&#34;. The Dot does not have a battery, so if you unplug it, it will need to search and connect to your WIFI again when you plug it back in. A great work around is to get a small battery pack (needs a least a 1 amp output port) and keep it plugged into the battery pack and then plug the battery pack into a wall charger. This allows the Dot to be truly portable. I had mine in my shirt pocket and was listening to a book while putting up Christmas lights outside for at least two hours. The Dot works Great, I am hoping that Alexa herself will get smarter. ",
Dion,"April 24, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought 16 of these and gave most of them out as Christmas presents. When I bought my first one in 2015 I was impressed with the questions I asked and the responses I received. These past 5 months or so I believe Alexia must have gone in for a lobotomy. Seldom understands the question. Upgraded to the Prime Music. For how large they say the music library is, I have it ask an average of 3 times before it sometimes plays the song I requested. Yes you can load all sorts of &#34;skills&#34; but they need to come up with a way to allow you to print or even e-mail the skills and commands to yourself. ",
"Bryan Warren","December 15, 2016 ",5.0,"So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable. Here's the basics. Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power. On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use. Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables. Using this rig through my phones hotspot along with Amazons unlimited music to replace XM radio for only $3.99 a month plus full functionality of hands free Alexa services. ",
william,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.    Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.    Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it. ",
"Chris Hockaday","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Biggest piece of junk ever. It worked great for 1 day. Then I unplugged it and plugged back in and it just spins with a blue light and is completely unresponsive, can't even reset the device.  I've googled everything I can think of to try but nothing works.  I get that stuff doesn't always work perfectly and has issues, but the biggest problem is that there is no customer support.  There is no phone number to call, or online tech support to help when your device isn't working properly.  I guess I'll throw it away. ",

StuE,"March 12, 2017 ",1.0,"I resisted buying any personal assistant until now. I don't have a 'connected home' and my entertainment system is on Google Player / Chromecast so it won't integrate with the Echo. So why 5 stars if I don't have even a few of the peripheral devices?    It costs $49.99 and I'm a Prime member - that's enough to make it worthwhile. &#34;Alexa, play 70s Rock Classics station&#34;. And for the next several hours I'm entertained.    Note to anyone in the digital advertising world: Echo uses Bing search and provides local results based on Yelp. All answers are also sent to the app on the smartphone paired to the Echo device. Geez, Bing? Yelp? Oh well, Echo can answer most questions...    Four years ago I was given a very good Vizio accessory speaker that worked with the iPad version 2. That iPad tanked last year and the newer Apple products don't use the larger USB connector so I thought the speaker was trash. Using the mini-pin output from Echo to the speaker I now have enough sound to fill the first floor of our house and reclaimed a speaker that would have been tossed to the curb. One advantage of the corded speaker connection - I don't have to re-do pairing ever, a common occurrence with any of my Bluetooth speakers.    I am looking for a white-light set of wi-fi enabled bulbs (boring, but useful) as a first step toward home automation.    I really want an Echo solution that can manage our TV with Hulu / Amazon / Netflix / Sling / YouTube. (Google Play would be a huge bonus. Because competitors). If I could replace the massive (and to some confusing) Harmony TV remote with voice commands life would be good. I can't find anyone who says they have successfully managed this set of tasks. Yes, the new Fire Stick is Alexa-enabled, but I'd prefer one listening device rather than two.    I considered the Google product and chose the Amazon Echo instead. While Google may have better search capabilities, I'm pretty well covered between phone and computers. I saw the Echo Dot as a low-cost entry point where I could salvage a good sounding compact speaker system AND dip my toe into home automation without spending a fortune. Next year? Who knows, but for right now the Echo Dot was exactly what I was looking for. ",
tonyb,"March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"This echo dot refuses to stay connected to Wi-Fi.  It initially connects without a problem. It works for short time, then it just stops.   I keep resetting it back to factory settings,  but it still does not connect.   I have had three echo's for quite a while and have never once had an issue with any of them.  This is the second dot have tried, and I have had the exact same issue with both of them. ",
TwistedTree,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Lasted just about 6 months, then started failing. We would give a command, and the dot would sit and think about answering. Stops in the middle of playing music. We ask it to turn off the lights using a wink hub, lights stay on and dot replies OK or the lights instantly go off, then the dot takes 2 to 3 minutes to respond OK. Ask it to tell us a joke, it tells the joke, but stops before giving the punch line. We have a full size echo that works fine, and we have tried moving the dot next to the echo to see if it was having issues with the wifi range, no change. Reset to factory defaults and setup from scratch, no change. We finally contacted tech support, who where useless. Bounced us around to 4 different techs in less then 5 minutes, where hung up on then finally told the case would be escalated to tier 2 support. All tier 2 support did was send an email telling us how to contact tech support again. Waste of time and money. ",
