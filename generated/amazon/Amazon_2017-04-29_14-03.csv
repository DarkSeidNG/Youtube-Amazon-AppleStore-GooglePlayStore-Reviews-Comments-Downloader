"E. Ervin","July 20, 2016 ",5.0,"This was not purchased for my own consumption but for the consumption of our youngest. This is one of her favorite things and she was very happy when she saw what I had bought for her. She tells me that these twizzlers are delicious and she likes them a lot. I like the way they are packaged in individual wrappers and in a very nice container. The funny thing was me trying to open an individual one for our little grandson. When I got it open, my husband thought it was for him and promptly ate it. I had an irritated little fellow on my hands for a few minutes. Both of those boys like twizzlers. They are very fresh and tasty. ",
"L. Sackman","October 28, 2015 ",2.0,"It's twizzlers, of course it is good.  I put this on my desk at work during the summer.  It's a good warm weather snack and with them being individually wrapped you don't have to worry about whose hands are in the candy jar.  Of course, I am biased when it comes to twizzlers.  I used these when I stopped smoking as I found it much better than a lollipop and instead of taking a puff, I took a bite. ",
david,"July 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I know I am being picky but these are tiny strips of the candy with a whole lot of packaging.  It does not appear to be as much Twizzlers candy as you get in the discount stores in a package for 99 cents.  It would be good for an office where people might wish just a tiny sweet snack.  No complaints on the Twizzler candy that I do love..just the packaging.  Each tiny strand of candy is individually wrapped and frustrating to open as the wrapper does not tear easily.  Anyway I will always buy Twizzlers, just not with all this packaging. ",
"J. Lowrie","July 31, 2016 ",5.0,"Twizzlers. Red candy goodness. These are like semi-soft red crack. Some say they have a strawberry flavor but all I know is that their is a Twizzler favorited fruit that they sell each spring.  This is a big tub of Twizzlers. While an OD is unlikely this big bucket could do it. So munch them with caution.    If you like Twizzlers and don't like to share then this is for you. If you fear zombies and want a lifetime supply of Twizzlers get a few cases of these. A guaranteed hit for any Twizzler fan. ",
Lori,"October 28, 2015 ",2.0,"Twizzlers: This is a very nice tub.  The lid fits back on securely. Each piece is individually wrapped.  I was pleasantly surprised how fresh they were. This is the way to buy them, individually wrapped, they will stay fresh for a long time.  There are 105 pieces of licorice in the tub. Now I didn't actually count them, however the tub is packed full. ðŸ˜„ ",
"Cosala Salaci","December 12, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought these for me, me! My children found my hiding place and have fallen in love with them. I have resigned myself to the fact that they are probably doing me a favour in making sure that I don't eat them all myself. They are really good and really reasonably priced. ",
LilyGirl,"September 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I like snack time and these licorice are individually wrapped. I don't like them to go stale so I purchase the individually wrapped ones. Licorice is just something yummy I like. The box is great to keep and contain them in. I like the strawberry flavor. There are 105 in the box but honestly that is never enough for me. Then people think that I want to share my licorice. So yeah they are that good that I want to hide them. I like that I can get them off of pantry. It is just so convenient. Twizzlers are a scrumptious. ",
JonnyLotto,"December 19, 2016 ",5.0,"I love Twizzlers.    I hate the stupid wrappers. Not the idea of individually wrapped Twizzlers, but the plastic they use to wrap these Twizzlers in is absolutely too light and clings to everything with the slightest motivation from a positive ion charge. ",
KH,"February 4, 2016 ",5.0,"Love how they are individually wrapped for freshness.  When I have bought Twizzlers in the past, unless you eat the whole package at once, they go stale and hard.  It is a bit of a pain to unwrap them when you want to eat several at one time; but it is worth it to ensure the freshness. ",
"Old Coast Customer","October 18, 2016 ",4.0,"I bought these as a desk top item to facilitate my coworkers stopping and chatting and grabbing one.  Works like a charm.  Everyone seems to recognize and love these twizzlers. ",
"Princess Mimi","July 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I ordered this product for my daughter's birthday party. I received it within two days of my original order date. The Twizzlers are soft to chew and they were longer than average size. Of course the flavor is great. This item is going to go very well on my daughter's candy table. I definitely recommend purchasing this item. These treats are perfect for parties. Using amazon prime was very convenient, if you don't have you should get it. It's worth the $$. ",
"Jared Castle","October 28, 2015 ",2.0,"Licorice is versatile. birthday parties, school lunches and holiday treats. I periodically keep a tub at the office to fend off co-workers who roam around in the afternoon, looking for a snack.    Licorice requires tender, loving care. Unlike hard candy, which can (and often does) sit for months in the bottom of your grandmother's purse, licorice tastes best soft and fresh. Storage should be airtight and at room temperature. That favors&nbsp;Twizzlers Twists (Strawberry, 105-Count), which come individually wrapped â€” perfect for packing into school lunches. These twists are OU Kosher Certified and 30 calories per piece.    The same canâ€™t be said for&nbsp;Twizzlers Twists (Rainbow Assortment, 12.4-Ounce Bag), with six flavors: blue raspberry, grape, lemonade, orange, strawberry, and watermelon. The twists are OU Kosher Certified and 40 calories per piece. See my pictures to see how the bag easily tears.    Of the two versions of Twizzlers, my sons (ages 13 and 12) prefer the individually wrapped strawberry twists. We had a birthday party with nine kids last weekend and you can see in the photos how many pieces from the rainbow assortment are still left. We sealed them up in a plastic bag, but I donâ€™t expect them to be eaten soon.    For years now, Iâ€™ve purchased four-pound tubs of&nbsp;Red Vines Red Licorice Twists&nbsp;for my kids. Red Vines are Star-K kosher-certified with no fat and only 140 calories per serving (five pieces/vines). My sons still favor Red Vines over Twizzlers because of the softer, more dough-like texture.    Rating: Three stars ",
"It&#039;s me","September 13, 2016 ",5.0,"What a large tub of licorice.  I love twizzlers and this is such a big pile of them I don;'t mind sharing.  They are perfect since they are individually wrapped that when people decide to share in your candy off your desk they aren't getting their grubby hands all over the ones you are going to eat yourself. ",
"D. L. Brown","May 15, 2016 ",3.0,"Yummy, this was a fun buy. I saw them and just had to have this container of Twizzlers yummy goodness. I like  everything about the container of good, the licorice is delicious and very fresh. This is sure to delight the real Twizzlers lover. I love it, highly recommend it, I will buy another. ",
"Amazon Customer","May 30, 2016 ",5.0,"These are great because they are individually wrapped so it is much more sanitary When my grandchildren and their friends (or anyone else)  reach in they are not  touching the other ones. ",
"Leigh Meeker","April 26, 2015 ",5.0,"I keep these in my office and my coworkers love them.  It's a great snack that doesn't bust diets.  The individual wrapping works well in an office setting where many people are putting their hands in this container. ",
KYKat,"April 18, 2016 ",5.0,"A HUGE tub of twizzlers for a great price!  These are my family's go-to snack.  Being individually wrapped is awesome for taking some with us on trips.  They were fresh and super yummy.  As soon as they arrived today, everyone was attacking the tub.  Awesome product! ",
"J. Donch","March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"It might be this one batch but, IMHO there is an absence of flavor which I had expected.  My grand daughter (a 6 year old world class candy expert) confirmed this when I offered one: &#34;you can't taste anything&#34; ",
"Linda Puckett","June 26, 2016 ",5.0,"Twizzlers are my favorite candy!  I bought these prewrapped twizzlers for Trick or Treat and for myself but was so disappointed to see how skinny and small they were.  I was not looking for a great price for a large amount ($5 for a little over 100 per container).  I was looking for the regular sized individually wrapped Twizzlers for freshness and my own convience. Would I by them again?  Not really sure. ",
"Amazon Customer","January 1, 2017 ",2.0,"product was as described and the price was comparable to grocery stores. I did notice that a few of the twizzlers seemed to be shorter/smaller than others, which is why I deducted one star. ",
mizzbellabella,"July 20, 2016 ",5.0,"I prefer Twizzlers over Red Vines any day of the week.  But, I had to take a star off because I didn't expect them to be individually wrapped...??? ",
MaxedMac,"October 28, 2015 ",2.0,"Packaging is great and convenient, like the individual wrapping.  Flavor is a bit to be desired however.  To me these taste a little bland. ",

They are each individually wrapped which makes them great for throwing in a backpack, lunch or keeping a few in the glove compartment for sweet tooth emergencies. I find the strawberry flavor to be rather artificial and waxy tasting myself but daughter loves them so... The fact that they come in a large container is another plus and they would male a nice snack for kids at a party or event. Overall a good purchase. ",

"Laurie Evans","October 28, 2015 ",5.0,"I think, for the future, I will purchase the bagged Twizzlers for home consumption rather than these individually wrapped twists.  Perfectly suitable in an office or public setting when you don't want everyone's grimy paws touching your food.  Plus, these twists are smaller - shorter and skinnier than their bagged counterparts.  I suppose having to work for your taste treat might be a good thing though - keeps you from over-indulging.  Nice for a grab and go or sugary pick-me-up stowed away in the car or purse. ",

"E. Ervin","January 11, 2015 ",5.0,"This is going to be a very odd review. 1. The computer tells me that the twizzlers have not arrived at my daughter's house. 2. She called me right after school so very pleased and happy that they arrived. She said that she knew how much I loved her because I sent her one of her most favorite things and she was enjoying the strawberry flavor. 3. I don't know what to think about any of this. But I am very glad that she is happy and pleased with her treat. I am wondering if the twizzler fairies got mixed up somehow and maybe they are going to send her another one for free. That would be nice, wouldn't it? Twizzlers are a great favorite of our girl. Five stars for the product and five stars for the mystery. ",

Shipping was fast on this product (surprised that it was shipped from Sam's Club)  Although, when I opened this package yesterday and went to eat some, I was very disappointed.  The licorice is stale - it is not soft like it is supposed to be.  I looked the date this morning and it is listed as 10/2015. ",
