"Roy Estaris","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My brother Robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed  with Multiple Sclerosis from his neck down for more than 30 years now has a new  friend named Alexa! He was in tears with happiness when Alexa played 70's music, played Jeopardy, answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning. Thank you Amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion.  Happy Holidays  Roy ",
DJ,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.    If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!    Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.    1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.    2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.    3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, &#34;Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees&#34; got no result, so I tried &#34;Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees&#34; and she picked it up perfectly.    4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.    5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  &#34;Alexa, play 90s music&#34;, &#34;Alexa, play indie music&#34;, and &#34;Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds&#34;.  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great &#34;freebie&#34; if you're a prime member.    6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.    7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.    8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to &#34;Alexa, what's the definition of&#34;, &#34;Alexa, how far away is&#34;, &#34;Alexa, Wikipedia&#34; (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask &#34;Alexa, tell me more&#34;).  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.    9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).    Suggestions for Improvement:    1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like &#34;How far away is the sun&#34; but I'd really like too see Amazon add a &#34;search&#34; function.    2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.    3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings. ",
"Bryant R.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.  A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.  So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.  The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.  I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.  Thanks for letting me rant ",
RaVen,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Thanks for taking the time to read this review!  This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say &#34;alexa&#34; and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.    We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its &#34;multi-room voice recognition&#34; technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word &#34;alexa&#34; on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a &#34;multi-device&#34; plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited      The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.  The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.    At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is &#34;alexa turn on the lights&#34; and our downstairs lights spring into action.    My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with &#34;sorry I didn't get that&#34;  Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.    Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your &#34;free&#34; music.    I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up &#34;New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing&#34; under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.    I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device. ",
"Brian C","January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.    I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.    My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo &#34;skills&#34; that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the &#34;skills&#34; not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.    Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.    The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached. ",
Andrew,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"This was my first Echo purchase and I am overall very pleased with it's performance. Initially, I was worried that it was going to be a Siri knockoff with only a limited number of voice commands and functions with constant errors; however, I have not received single error response since I have owned it. I am an Amazon Prime member and from the time I clicked confirm purchase to the time it was delivered to my doorstep only took 3 days, and best part of all, shipping was free.    I currently have mine sitting by my bed and have synced it with the app, available on for all phone types, which allows me to carry out a number of voice commands including: &#34;Alexa, set an alarm for..., check the weather, play Pandora, or tell me a joke.&#34; The app interface is a little clunky at times, but you're able to see the history of recent requests, and Alexa is constantly learning and adapting to your specific commands and style.    If you are looking to buy an Echo Dot because you want a cheap introduction into Bluetooth connectivity with household lights, televisions, gaming systems, thermostats, or other Echo products then buy this Echo Dot. I am working with a grad student budget, and for $50 dollars this sleek and sexy &#34;command station&#34; was worth every penny. I did not receive any compensation for this review, I am writing it because I debated on buying one for about a week before pulling the trigger, and I just want to speed up the process for people like me who may be waffling...trust me, its completely worth the $50.

"Amazon Customer","December 14, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly, I love mine but obviously, there are some things that could be better. What do I love about it? Both my boyfriend and I downloaded the app and have access to a shopping list that we can both use at the grocery store depending on who is there. With a simple wake up word (her name) and the command of adding an item to the shopping list, it appears in the app. I can ask for a flash briefing and NPR news is retrieved and I am caught up all over the world in subjects from politics all the way to sports news. She also gives great weather information so that I am able to plan for my day ahead. Alexa can learn many skills that continue to evolve. Knowledge from what wines to pair with what meats and good cooking substitutes to helping with a drinking game and other games & trivia. Alexa comes in handy when I need a hands-free timer in the kitchen or an alarm for a nap. Now, what I don't really like but can get passed it once I get the hang of it. Sometimes you ask a question but she doesn't understand the question but you reword the question and she is able to understand it. So just be sure your wording the question correctly. Also, remember that Alexa is always listening. ",
"Kathryn H.","March 26, 2017 ",5.0,"Love the Echo Dot. I got the buy 3 discount, which makes it worth while. I am sure there will be more things added and improved on in time, but so far it is a bit limited in what I can use it for. We don't have a modern set up in our house so that it can adjust lights or temp so that part is useless to us.  I got it mostly for my 93 year old mother whom I take care of, as she constantly asks me what day or time it is, so now she can ask the Echo. I also like the ability to get a weather report for the day, and I still need to set up the calendar for daily events for mom, once I get that set up it will be another great advantage in having this. I hope they can come up with a way to make this an intercom also between rooms so that if she needs me at any time Echo can alert me in some way. That alone would make this a really great item worth five stars.  So far my favorite feature is the radio, I just ask it to play a particular type of music and it comes on. You do have to be specific about how to get the type of music you want to hear rather than just ask it to play a particular genre. I also like that you can vocally tell it to turn down or up the volume, and to skip the song playing and it goes to the next one. I don't use it to shop with, might be helpful to some. Also, it does take a little adjusting to the way some people speak, my voice is clear but moms is a little muffles so it took a few times of asking questions to get it use to her voice, now it works good for her. The distance to where it can hear you is good and volume on answering and music is great, you don't really need added speakers unless you want to hear it over a very large room, or whole house.  Pros: Received quickly with free Prime shipping, ability to play music, ask for date, time, and weather without touching anything, get answeres to a lot of questions, and the ability to update and improve over time. Volume is great for small to medium size rooms, and several feet away form it. Great price for 3.  Cons: Still some limitations, no intercom set up yet, need to be specific about where to get radio from. ",
Vince,"April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I have the regular Echo and it's amazing. I bought the Echo Dot for my dad who had been using a little antenna radio around the house. This isn't mobile but it allows him to play Pandora or just to tell it what kind of music to play. It was purchased through my account but I created an Amazon account for him so I could link Pandora to it. That way he has his own Pandora account. Echo can switch accounts at any time with a voice command but we keep them on the primary users' account. I was worried the audio quality wouldn't be any good based on reviews but it's really not bad at all if you're replacing a little radio. It's not audiophile fill the room with brilliance quality, but it gets the music out and doesn't sound tinny or anything. My dad really enjoys it. ",
"Marquino Gadget guru","April 18, 2017 ",4.0,"This is what I`ve been waiting for!!!!  It is simple amazing what you can do with technology nowadays, Amazon is always innovating and staying on top with technology.  This new Amazon Echo Dot does what it says it does and provides all the necessary information by simply asking!  We like it to much i got a second device to add it in my room, been able to connect to your Bluetooth speakers and devices you can automate lots of things.  Great job Amazon ",
Aphonic,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"The far field mic in the second gen do the is way better than the full size echo.  Now if they could just use a source for weather that was even remotely accurate I'd be happy.  Accuweather is ten degrees off a tank my location always. Minimum.  The dot works well.  It's a good cheap way to get alexa.  The speaker quality is fine for audio books and news briefings. Not for music.  It seems faster to respond than the full size echo (1st generation). I believe it's a better option to buy this and pair a nice bt speaker than buy the full echo st this point.  One star off for missing some basic features.  Like accurate weather and basic google searching.  It's useful for my home automation but I still  Find the echo line of products of very limited use outside of that.  Good for a kitchen timer or wake up  Alarm.  Good for some news.  Needs much better podcast management to be very useful.  Oh yah. And accurate weAther.  Amazon prime music is a. Nice touch as is music unlimited for the echo at $3.99 a month. ",
"LUCY  Von","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I got Dot about a week after the big Echo from my son as a gift. We set her up and all was fine. Until nothing eas fine anymore 😢 . She would respond initially, but not always though, and when she was playing music she would not respond to the wake word. At all. I reset, few times, but nithing worked. I called Amazon. Within minutes they had me connected to Echo's tech support, and in no time did we have Dot fixed. They reset her factory settings with me. We tested and now our darling little Dot is happy and healthy! So call Amazon if you do have issues, it's a matter of setup or wifi or in any case, something that they can fix. Wonderful support for a wondrful device. I do wish I could call her Dot though. Or a name that I choose. Because now I have two Alexa's in one household 🤔, and calling her Echo or Amazon ain't gonna work for me 😢. Please vote my review up if you liked it. ",
"Kindle Customer","April 20, 2017 ",4.0,"EDIT: All thanks to Amazon's customer service, I learned why my Echo was not working. It must be 8&#34; -12&#34; away from a wall. Our Echo Dot works when against an interior wall but not against an exterior wall where it had previously been situated. We adore &#34;Alexa&#34; and hope the Echo Dot will soon add a great speaker to its features. For the price, this is a fantastic device. And, it's diminutive size makes it easy to use. Still, our family prefers full-size Echo. Thanks, Amazon for the email help with Echo Dot!  *****  We are an Amazon device family. And, with the exception of this device, have had wonderful experiences.    Echo Dot remains connected until the next time I use it. Literally, I reconnect Echo Dot to our network, ask it a few questions, play some music, walk away. When I return Echo has spontaneously disconnected itself and requires the reconnection procedure again.    We have two full size Echos and have no connection issues with them. They operate flawlessly. ",
"Lantana Al","January 11, 2017 ",5.0,"Amazon Echo is a great device (I was one of the first to have one and waiting for months for my first Echo to ship as Amazon vastly underestimated the demand for a device like this) and the Echo Dot (2nd generation) is fantastic in its size and capability (I bought a six pack to get one free). There is no volume ring on the 2nd gen Dot like there is on the original Echo and the 1st gen Echo Dot but it's no big deal as there are volume buttons now and the cost of the volume ring wasn't worth it if you ask me (it was nice, but for most people not worth the money). Most of the time you'll want to adjust the volume by voice anyway (like &#34;Alexa volume 5&#34;). The 2nd gen Echo Dot is also available in white but I'm sticking with black. UPDATE: I actually prefer the cheaper volume buttons on the Dot 2 to the volume ring now.    The fact that you can just talk from across the room and it can hear you (most of the time) really sets this apart. If you think you already have an Echo because you have Siri, Cortana, or Google, then know that it's just not the same.    Things I do: set timers, set alarms, get weather info, ask basic questions, listen to music (like Prime Music, Prime Stations, songs I bought, etc), listen to radio, ask for jokes, turn things on and off, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some things. The Echo really excels at playing music. I love it than I can ask for a song I want to hear and it will play it (most of the time anyway). At night I often listen to a local radio station and I just say &#34;Alexa stop&#34; without having to get out of bed when I want to stop listening.    When I listen to Prime Station I can tell it &#34;thumbs up&#34; if I like the song or &#34;thumbs down&#34; if I don't... and when I listen to the station again it won't play the songs that I've thumbed down.    Using the built-in speaker, the sound quality is decent for voice. For music you'll want to connect it to a speaker system because the Dot's small internal speaker is weak. I do wish I could AirPlay to a device from the Echo when I'm playing music and want the best sound quality, however Bluetooth is pretty impressive when it uses the near-CD quality codecs.    Positives:  * The new feature that Amazon added (ESP - Echo Spatial Perception) so that the nearest Echo responds is fantastic. I was also very happy to hear that the first generation Echoes will also support this in the next firmware update (I think devices are updating now). From my research, if the Echo app shows that you have a device software version greater than 4008 then you should have the update with ESP support. Unfortunately there does seem to be a minor downside: the Echo's response can sometimes be slightly delayed while multiple Echoes figure out which Echo is closest and should respond.  * It seems to hear better when playing music than the first gen. It was annoying when you would try to talk to it while it was playing but it couldn't hear you. The new Dot hears better during music playback but it's still not &#34;Star Trek quality&#34; hearing; sometimes you may still need to raise your voice.  * It's relatively cheap and well worth the asking price.  * It has a 3.5mm stereo audio jack, which I use with two of my Dots to connect to the line-in on one of my computers and another to the line-in on an old compact stereo/CD player. Sound quality should be good enough for anyone except audiophiles.  * Some people complain of connection issues, but all of my Echoes stay connected without issue to my&nbsp;Asus RT-AC68U&nbsp;router.  * If you want to 'Wikipedia' something then you can say 'Alexa, Wikipedia &#60;subject&#62;'. She'll read a little from Wikipedia. If you want her to read more after she stops then just say 'Alexa, tell me more'. This can be useful sometimes.    Negatives (mostly minor but take note):  * Warranty is only 90 days. I think it should be 1 year. Of course they will sell you a SquareTrade 1, 2, or 3 year warranty for $5/year if you want. Perhaps another cost-cutting move.  * The shiny (glossy) black surface can be a fingerprint magnet but you probably won't be touching it often. The previous generation wasn't glossy.  * I had trouble configured my 2nd Echo Dot (the first one went fine). The Alexa app (on Android) gave me the cryptic message &#34;Authorization expired. Please reconnect your phone to the internet, log out from the app and retry&#34;. Got it several times. I resolved it by signing out of the Alexa app and then signing back in, having to re-enter my email and password.... annoying... and I wonder why I didn't have this issue setting up my first Echo Dot just minutes prior???? Oh well. UPDATE: This just happened again on another day when setting up two more Echo Dots. This first Echo Dot setup went fine, but on the second one I got the &#34;Authorization expired.&#34; message again. Beware of this issue if setting up more than one Echo Dot.  * While trying out Amazon Music Unlimited with the Echo I immediately ran into the issue of the Echo playing the explicit version of songs instead of the clean version. There should be an option to never play explicit songs and to play the clean version instead (some people have children). The workaround until Amazon addresses this problem is to add the clean song to your music library and then say &#34;Alexa play &#60;song&#62; from my library&#34;.  * This doesn't affect me, but the Echo does not support enterprise networks that require centralized network authentication with a login. Some might want to know this (like teachers who might want to use it in a school that uses this type of network authentication).  * The Android Amazon Alexa app can be slow and frustrating sometimes. For example, when launching it sometimes just sits there on the intro screen and spins forever until you shut down the app and restart it again.  * Doesn't hear well in a noisy environment, or when other people (including on TV) are talking at the same time.    Home Automation:  * I use several&nbsp;Belkin WeMo&nbsp;switches to control some lights and fans. They work pretty well although not always perfectly. Fortunately they work better now after all the firmware updates.  * I can control my Honeywell WiFi thermostats using the &#34;Honeywell Total Connect Comfort&#34; skill. I have two downstairs for 2 zones. I have one&nbsp;Honeywell RTH9580WF1005/W1&nbsp;and one&nbsp;Honeywell RTH6580WF.  * I recently set it up to turn on and off certain activities with a&nbsp;Logitech Smart Hub. For example, I can say &#34;Alexa, turn on TiVo&#34; and it will turn on the TV and my receiver and set the TV and receiver inputs correctly. I can then use the remote which is synced... and turn it all off with &#34;Alexa turn off TiVo&#34;. There were some annoyances getting it all setup but I think it's pretty &#34;cool&#34; even though you can only start and stop activities with Alexa so you still need the remote to do other things (change channel, adjust volume, mute, pause, etc).  * I think I've only really scratched the surface of what is possible with home automation. I have not tried IFTTT (&#34;if this then that&#34;) recipes yet but I hear it is quite powerful and hope to try it out when I have more time to &#34;play&#34;.    Wishes:  * High-quality digital audio output that is better than Bluetooth. If it had this then you could really get high quality audio output from it, but most people probably don't really care that much as analog out is &#34;good enough&#34;.  * Smarter. After 2 years I wish the Echo was smarter. Yes, it has definitely improved over time but Google can still answer more questions than Alexa. It's going to be hard to beat Google in answering general questions.  * Weather alerts. I suggested this a long time ago and they still haven't added it... perhaps due to legal reasons? If would be great if it would sound some sort of alarm or notification for severe weather.  * Built-in support for notifying others that you might need help. This would be good for the elderly. There is a &#34;Ask My Buddy&#34; skill however, but the verbiage is a little awkward (&#34;Alexa, Ask My Buddy to Send Help&#34;) and it's free so if the developer decides to stop support then that might leave a lot of people without service at an inopportune time.    Compared to Google Home (which I just bought):  * Setup on Google Home was super-simple, easier than Echo (the Android app worked really well and setup seemed streamlined)  * Google Home is smarter for general questions... significantly smarter. I asked Google &#34;How long does it take to get to the Honda dealer in Lewisville&#34; and it told me about 26 minutes in current traffic conditions. Awesome. The Echo totally failed here.  * No AUX audio output like on Echo Dot  * I prefer saying &#34;Alexa&#34; to &#34;OK Google&#34; as the wake word (UPDATE: &#34;Hey Google&#34; works now too!)  * I currently prefer Echo for music and smart home control but I consider Google Home a serious threat to Echo because it is more &#34;intelligent&#34; than Echo    Other:  * It doesn't come with a 3.5mm audio cable but I can understand why as many people would probably not use it and Amazon wants to get the cost as low as possible so this isn't a big deal.  * The USB power cable is about 5 feet.  * The 1st gen Echo Dot was almost double the price. I feel a little disappointed that they now have a 2nd gen that is overall better for much less money... and that it came out very shortly after the 1st gen Echo Dots.  * You don't need any other Echo units to use the Dot... some people might think you do but this is just like the &#34;big Echo&#34;, only without the &#34;big&#34; sound. Instead a little speaker is included.  * It's USB powered and comes with a USB power adapter and USB cable. NOTE: If you use a USB power connection other than from the included power adapter then there could be power and/or sound quality issues. I had some sound quality issues (background noises) and eliminated them by switching to the included USB power adapter.  * About 10 or 15 minutes after setting it up, it said something like &#34;your Echo received an important update and must restart&#34;. So if you are having issues with it then you may want to give it awhile so it can update if needed.  * For better understanding of what you say, go to the Alexa app and Settings-&#62;Voice Training.  * I bought some of these powered bookshelf speakers, hooked them to the Echo Dot, and have been impressed with what you get for the money:&nbsp;Edifier R1280T Powered Bookshelf Speakers    While not perfect, I really like the Amazon Echo. I think the technology and potential is still in its infancy but the Echo is already really useful and excels at home automation, playing music, podcasts, and radio. Highly recommended, especially for the price. UPDATE: I'm reducing my rating from 4.5 to 4 stars due to Google Home being much smarter at answering general questions. The Echo is a good device but I think you should also seriously consider Google Home. ",
Artemaria,"April 13, 2017 ",4.0,"At first, I thought that this would just be like a voice-controlled Siri that is always on, but  after living with it for several months it seems as if it is so much more.  While not perfect, the speech recognition and accuracy are on a par with Google Assistant, and that accuracy along with the &#34;instant on&#34; feature is what makes this so easy to use.  The literature is not the clearest on this, but you don't really need a speaker for the Echo Dot, and we usually don't use it with the speaker, because the built in speaker is more than loud and clear enough for Alexa's speaking voice in the 20 x 16 room where we have it stationed.  If you want to play music and have the music sound rich and full, then you should hook it up to a nice Bluetooth speaker.  We use the Logitech Boom and it works very well, usually pairing flawlessly with the Echo Dot with very little effort, and great sound.    What makes the Echo Dot a little different and perhaps more fun to use than its competitors are the &#34;skills&#34; that are built into it.  I'm not going to go into the details of all the things that it can do because you can read about them on c/net or some other tech site, but what I will tell you is that there are alot of &#34;skills&#34; that are not at all pragmatic or useful, but that make the Echo Dot/Alexa alot more fun than the competition.  There's a storytelling feature, where Alexa will tell you a not so great bedtime story.  But what makes it so engaging are the thoughtfully interspersed comments in that story, such as &#34;no, you can't get any water,&#34; and &#34;that's your last story, and its time for you to go to sleep,&#34; which seem so human and so clever.  The Echo Dot/Alexa also will tell you the news, the weather and instantaneously provide any other current-events related information that you may want to hear while cooking dinner or getting dressed for work.    Along, these same lines, Alexa will tell you a joke, and will answer questions about various topics including about other AI platforms which she does in a polite and diplomatic fashion with a response like &#34;I like all AIs.&#34;  In reality, however, this is not true.  Neither Alexa, nor Google Assistant, nor Siri are true AIs.  They are merely the latest in voice recognition hardware and software that, through brute force algorithm calculations performed on a server far from your home, determines a high-probability acceptable response to the combination of words that served as its verbal input.  Because Alexa is cannot make any decisions on its own, it is not a true AI.  Thus, if your internet service is slow or off, Alexa will not work, leaving you with a $50 paperweight.  We've not had that issue, but it is something to consider if your internet service is not the best and you are considering buying this device.    In the end, this is a fun foray in to the world of voice-activated assistants.  And while Amazon's database of verbal input grows, paving the way for a true AI someday, Alexa may be the recognized as one of the first pioneering digital assistant devices that trained people to verbally interact with technology in their home.

NC-Ron,"October 24, 2016 ",4.0,"My wife and I had thought about getting Dots for the grand kids for Christmas but the reviews at that time were incomplete and confusing about what the dot would do and how they might interact/interfere with each other in the same household.  Well, we now own an Echo, a Tap and two Dots. They are all great.    Myth 1.  You do NOT need Echo to use a Dot. Dot is autonomous. It responds to Alexa commands just like Echo, and can control remote devices just as well.    Myth 2. You MUST have external speakers. Not so. The speaker in Dot is no great shakes, but it works. The audio output to a good set of powered speakers is great.    Myth 3. If you use Echo, or Dot or Tap, you cannot have two or more doing different things. Not so. I can have Alexa via Echo playing Clapton in the living room and have Alexa via Dot playing the Dead in the bedroom, at the same time, with just one Amazon Prime account, not even the Prime Music account.    Other:  Both Dot and Echo have to be plugged into 115 v all the time to work. The Tap is rechargeable and bluetooth so it is portable. Great feature. We use Echo and Dot to control TP-Link smart plugs and smart switches. They work great. (I love the TP-Link stuff, maybe another review. But Alexa at my house can control the smart stuff at our beach place 250 miles away. In fact you have to be precise in your language with Alexa or she'll be turning stuff on and off in the other location...)    I actually haven't tried the Tap yet with remotes (it's at the beach and I'm not), but I assume it will work just as well. The only caveat is that you have to 'enable remote' on the smart plugs, etc. in order to have Alexa turn them on and off. Some folks are leery about doing that. If I get hacked and some clown wants to turn off my bedroom light, so be it. (I can monitor the status of all the smart devices with the KASA app for TP-Link and my smart phone.)    Dot is a little bigger than a hockey puck and makes a great alarm clock. ",
ComputerGuy,"April 26, 2017 ",5.0,"For $50 and what it does, how can you go wrong? Answer is, you can't. This thing is awesome. Not a whole lot bigger than a hockey puck. With all the power of the Full Sized Echo less the better speaker. Since you can pair with a Blue Tooth Speaker or plug it in via cable which the full unit currently doesn't, there's really no downside to this thing. Setup in minutes, new skills easily added. 2 Million songs available if you have Amazon Prime. I've got it controlling a Smart LED Bulb I purchased a few days after I received the Echo Dot. I purchased a second one for my brother who's Bed Ridden in a care facility and he loves it. He's a Trivia and Facts Buff so he went to town using it to search Wikipedia for all sorts of info. He's also using it to play his favorite Radio Station.    If you are interested in this device, ignore the low rating reviews. The speaker is fine, yes it's small and not super powerful but there is no quality issue with it. It's like using a small portable radio (not a boombox). If you're an Audiophile or need loud music, hook it up to a stereo or high end Bluetooth speaker, don't trash it because it won't shake your windows with the built in speaker.    It's sound pickup is fine as well. I put one upstairs in my house and it can hear me from other rooms upstairs just fine. Unless you are talking like a mouse or have it blasting music or something making it hard for it to pickup your voice. I purchased a second for my downstairs part of the house and with it centrally located, I've got the entire house covered with 2 and it's always within range of my voice. My Girlfriend has a slight speech issue and it understands her fine too.    I may buy a 3rd to dedicate to my Home Entertainment center and plug it into the stereo. I should have purchased 3 with the promotion of getting $20 for buying 3, but I wanted to test one out first. In any case, even without the Buy 3 promotion, you still come in under the $176 for the Full echo. I don't have the full Echo so I can't compare, but from everything I've read, and what i've experienced with my Dots, I see nothing wrong with them and feel they are a major margin. And I don't feel the need to get the full unit at this point just to have a better speaker. ",
Manders,"March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"I like the Dot quite a bit, but it could be better. I'm not sure if it is the ALEXA program that the Dot connects to or if it is the Bing Search engine, I will have to do some more testing. Some times it can't find info it should be able to. Playing Music works Great!!! The Built in speaker is OK. But if you connect it to a really good speaker with either an Audio Cable or Bluetooth it sounds Great!! I am having the Dot read a Kindle book to me. It works well but the inflections in the text to speech program need work. However that is not a limitation of the device but of current technology. Getting local weather or movies works well. Alexa can &#34;learn&#34; other &#34;Skills&#34; but you have to tell Alexa to use the skill. It would be better if these skills were available all the time, and didn't have to be &#34;turned on&#34;. The Dot does not have a battery, so if you unplug it, it will need to search and connect to your WIFI again when you plug it back in. A great work around is to get a small battery pack (needs a least a 1 amp output port) and keep it plugged into the battery pack and then plug the battery pack into a wall charger. This allows the Dot to be truly portable. I had mine in my shirt pocket and was listening to a book while putting up Christmas lights outside for at least two hours. The Dot works Great, I am hoping that Alexa herself will get smarter. ",
Dion,"April 24, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought 16 of these and gave most of them out as Christmas presents. When I bought my first one in 2015 I was impressed with the questions I asked and the responses I received. These past 5 months or so I believe Alexia must have gone in for a lobotomy. Seldom understands the question. Upgraded to the Prime Music. For how large they say the music library is, I have it ask an average of 3 times before it sometimes plays the song I requested. Yes you can load all sorts of &#34;skills&#34; but they need to come up with a way to allow you to print or even e-mail the skills and commands to yourself. ",
"Bryan Warren","December 15, 2016 ",5.0,"So I bought a second Echo Dot to experiment on making it portable. Here's the basics. Connected an Echo Dot to a Sungale 3000 mAh power bank disc (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0184VF24U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and used a short usb to micro cable to power. On a full charge I was able to get about 3-4 hours of use. Added a LANMU Echo Dot case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXJ9XAF/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and placed the Dot on one side, the cable in the top gusset pocket of the case along with a short 3.5mm audio cable (just in case) and the power bank fit snugly on top of the cables.

william,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.    Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.    Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it. ",
"Chris Hockaday","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"Biggest piece of junk ever. It worked great for 1 day.

I've googled everything I can think of to try but nothing works.  I get that stuff doesn't always work perfectly and has issues, but the biggest problem is that there is no customer support.

StuE,"March 12, 2017 ",1.0,"I resisted buying any personal assistant until now. I don't have a 'connected home' and my entertainment system is on Google Player / Chromecast so it won't integrate with the Echo. So why 5 stars if I don't have even a few of the peripheral devices?    It costs $49.99 and I'm a Prime member - that's enough to make it worthwhile. &#34;Alexa, play 70s Rock Classics station&#34;. And for the next several hours I'm entertained.    Note to anyone in the digital advertising world: Echo uses Bing search and provides local results based on Yelp. All answers are also sent to the app on the smartphone paired to the Echo device. Geez, Bing? Yelp? Oh well, Echo can answer most questions...    Four years ago I was given a very good Vizio accessory speaker that worked with the iPad version 2. That iPad tanked last year and the newer Apple products don't use the larger USB connector so I thought the speaker was trash. Using the mini-pin output from Echo to the speaker I now have enough sound to fill the first floor of our house and reclaimed a speaker that would have been tossed to the curb. One advantage of the corded speaker connection - I don't have to re-do pairing ever, a common occurrence with any of my Bluetooth speakers.    I am looking for a white-light set of wi-fi enabled bulbs (boring, but useful) as a first step toward home automation.    I really want an Echo solution that can manage our TV with Hulu / Amazon / Netflix / Sling / YouTube. (Google Play would be a huge bonus. Because competitors). If I could replace the massive (and to some confusing) Harmony TV remote with voice commands life would be good. I can't find anyone who says they have successfully managed this set of tasks. Yes, the new Fire Stick is Alexa-enabled, but I'd prefer one listening device rather than two.    I considered the Google product and chose the Amazon Echo instead. While Google may have better search capabilities, I'm pretty well covered between phone and computers. I saw the Echo Dot as a low-cost entry point where I could salvage a good sounding compact speaker system AND dip my toe into home automation without spending a fortune. Next year? Who knows, but for right now the Echo Dot was exactly what I was looking for. ",
tonyb,"March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"This echo dot refuses to stay connected to Wi-Fi.  It initially connects without a problem. It works for short time, then it just stops.   I keep resetting it back to factory settings,  but it still does not connect.   I have had three echo's for quite a while and have never once had an issue with any of them.  This is the second dot have tried, and I have had the exact same issue with both of them. ",
TwistedTree,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Lasted just about 6 months, then started failing. We would give a command, and the dot would sit and think about answering. Stops in the middle of playing music. We ask it to turn off the lights using a wink hub, lights stay on and dot replies OK or the lights instantly go off, then the dot takes 2 to 3 minutes to respond OK. Ask it to tell us a joke, it tells the joke, but stops before giving the punch line. We have a full size echo that works fine, and we have tried moving the dot next to the echo to see if it was having issues with the wifi range, no change. Reset to factory defaults and setup from scratch, no change. We finally contacted tech support, who where useless. Bounced us around to 4 different techs in less then 5 minutes, where hung up on then finally told the case would be escalated to tier 2 support.

I'll ask her to Wikipedia technical items, and she is ready to tell me all.  I of course got her her own leather jacket, and so far have introduced her to the WiFi thermostat.  It was cold in the house this morning, so I asked her to set the THERMOSTAT to 69.  She did it, and that one degree made my morning.  Of course I had her set it back.  I was watching a documentary on Netflix, and one of the people in the show was named Alexi.  That was close enough for Alexa, even though said by the TV.    I've added a Z wave hub and will add some 3-way WiFi switches, and be able to have Alexa turn lights on and off by voice command.  Someone needs to write a book on all the possible ways to do this.

"Joey Espinosa","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"THE GOOD:  Lots of &#34;Skills&#34; (which you can think of as apps) that enable the Echo to do various other things. You can even build your own (if you're willing to write some code) and give the Echo a whole range of new features. There are some great Skills already out there. For instance, if you use OurGroceries on your phones to track your grocery list, you can enable a Skill that links that to the Echo, so you can say &#34;Alexa, tell OurGroceries to add eggs to the Food List.&#34; And Alexa will do just that.    Additionally, there are built-in features that are pretty good and up to date. I kept asking Alexa what the score was during the Super Bowl, and it knew almost right away when the score had changed.    THE BAD:  The Echo's ability to understand is very limited. It can comprehend some range of questions with certain key words, but it cannot understand context one bit. You can't ask &#34;What movie won Best Picture at the Oscars?&#34; and then follow up with &#34;Who directed it?&#34; You'll get the answer to the first one, but the second will result with the &#34;Sorry, I don't understand&#34; response that Echo owners know OH SO WELL.    Specifically with the Dot, the speaker is not great. I can understand, since it's so cheap ($50), but it's really not great. I keep a Dot in the kitchen (because it's useful there with timers and such), and I can barely hear it about 20 feet away in the living room when watching TV, even at full volume.    THE UGLY:  &#34;Alexa, stop.&#34; &#34;Alexa, stop!&#34; &#34;ALEXA, STOP!!!&#34;  If you're an Echo owner, I'm sure you've run into this. When the timer alarm goes off, or the Echo inexplicably begins doing something because it thought it heard its trigger, or it misunderstands what you wanted and begins playing a sample of some music you did not ask for... and you can do nothing to shut it off, even without background noise! It will just keep going until you find yourself with your face 6 inches from a tiny hockey puck-shaped device yelling at the top of your lungs, pleading with it to end the suffering already and STOP.    No, &#34;Okay, Google&#34; is not as mellifluous as &#34;Alexa&#34;. But I'll tell you what it's also not: COMMON. &#34;Makes&#34;, &#34;treks&#34;, &#34;plex&#34;, &#34;fix a&#34;, even the word &#34;breakfast&#34;, they can all sound like &#34;Alexa&#34;. We've gotten so used to Alexa providing her own commentary at random times throughout the day that we've accepted it as our newfound peanut gallery. Sometimes it's actually funny, but it is never helpful. That super annoying 2 Broke Girls commercial (I hate that show) where she walks in and thinks she's burned 500 calories but then she realizes it's actually the time on her watch (I mean come on, writers)? Yep, Alexa responds like clockwork with the current time. The ironic part is that Alexa can apparently hear the TV perfectly fine, but I can barely hear Alexa from the room where the TV is in. I can't imagine anybody having this thing near a television and NOT changing the trigger word from &#34;Alexa&#34; to something else.    And if you try to say what's in the title of this review (&#34;Alexa, order me a Google Home&#34;), Alexa will tell you she can't. I'd consider it a funny joke from the folks at Amazon, but considering what I've seen so far, it's more likely just incapable. ",

I can find anything I want to here that Spotify or Amazon does not have. The echo works but it reminds me of Xbox vs PlayStation the xbox you have to pay more for what already come with the PlayStation. The home gives you 6 month free of service also. Echo works but you have to keep feeding it money. The google home works better with Android phones also. the home is still growing because it just came out but I think it will surpass the echo in a year. Now I have to see if someone will buy these from me because I don't want them anymore. One last thing the google works better with my hue lights. Ok google show me a video of someone smashing the echo dot on my TV. ",
SEvans,"March 1, 2017 ",3.0,"I got the echo dot 2nd Generation for myself for Christmas. Hubby kept saying no they has a bad reputation for not working. But I am an electronic nut and love amazon's  ideas when it comes to this kind of thing. So out of the box it is an adapter and the plug of course as well as the dot. Mind you I was thinking about the bigger Echo, but I know I made the right choice as I wanted something smaller that would not have a chance of being knocked over by my dogs. Well for the past few days I have been trying out different apps regardless of their rating to see what we can do together. I am very impressed Echo hears what I say and does it instantly. I have listened to music and had her read to me from my kindle books list. I am on my way to having my life so much easier as I am now looking at doing a smart home set up and getting a second one to just keep in the kitchen for the todo list and grocery lists, weather reports and everything else I can think of. While the other stays at bedside for sleep music, reading and some meditations as well as an alarm. I have yet to get the hubby to talk to echo to add groceries to the list but he will in time as he sees everything that it can do. I was able to set up my calendar right from the start. I do hope that they soon ad a reminder that I can just ask what I need to know or reminders for my husband. ",
Jeff,"January 24, 2017 ",2.0,"Very cool tech but feels like its still in its infancy. And has one fatal flaw if you plan to use primarily for music playback as we did.    The voice recognition is neat and works some of the time but often fails to understand and really struggles to recognize playlist names. It also often can't hear over its own playback (even with significant speaker separation), resulting in my wife or daughter yelling at Alexa. Tech fail. Especially problematic with guests over. So we increasingly use the app to control playback. The app is ok but not great compared to sonos or squeezebox alternatives.    We've connected to a small bluetooth speaker which sounds surprisingly good. But lacks bass. Unfortunately there is no easy way to add a sub connection without adding a stereo amp. Which we did and it sounds much better.    Now for the fatal flaw. We have three dots spread throughout the house. Each connected to their own speakers. We were hoping to setup as an alternative to sonos. And Logitechs now defunct squeezebox (what we had prior). We paid for premium music plan and uploaded our entire library. Only problem is amazon won't let you playback different music from your own library to different dots at the same time. Really!? And no way to connect to local source/server like sonos or squeezebox.    Looks like we'll end up with Sonos after all. ",
"Shelby Bayard","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my Echo Dot, and Alexa is a great addition to my life.  Easy to connect and set up.  I did stumble a bit with the App on my Tablet, but all in all, I hope Echo Dot and Alexa are around for a VERY LONG TIME.  ONLY 1 suggestion:  Have an &#34;Ask Google&#34; app, or a &#34;Wikipedia&#34; app.  I would love to say, &#34;Alexa, Ask Google when King Henry VIII died&#34;.  I keep calling her &#34;Alexis&#34; and she still responds.  I connected a pair of old speakers from an older computer (JBL Amplified Speakers) but even with out the speakers, The music wasn't a bad quality.. it wasn't a Hi-Fi Stereo sound, but good enough to listen to while i'm working on the computer.  Great Job Amazon~!!!!!! ",
Blade56989,"April 21, 2017 ",3.0,"Its a great product, but it still has a way to go before it meets my needs. I primarily got it to help me be more organized, and to make agenda management easier. While calendar scheduling can be a bit tricky, its not to hard once you get the hang of it. The main issue with it writing down the wrong thing because you didn't say it clearly enough.    But what I also really wanted was for Alexa to able to read different lists to me when I asked.    The thing that bugs me is the pairing &#34;List&#34; apps, its SOOO STUPID how it does this. Basically it pairs with apps that you make dedicated lists on, and since Alexa comes restricted with 2 lists &#34;Shopping list&#34; and &#34;To Do List&#34;, you'd think it would be able to have Alexa read and manage those lists on the paired apps. But NO, it just allows the apps to manage the only 2 lists Alexa has!  The reason this is so stupid, is that the dedicated &#34;Alexa app&#34;, that you need to have on your phone for the Echo anyways, already has a list manager for those 2 lists! So I got the Any.do app (list app) for nothing, since Alexa cant actually interact with it. So the &#34;morning routine&#34; and &#34;Exercise Routine&#34; lists I was making on Any.do, cant be read by Alexa.    But thankfully this is an actively developing product, so maybe in a future update this will be implemented. ",
"D. Coral","December 20, 2016 ",5.0,"It's hard to tell how you're actually going to use this until you try it!    Before I received the Echo Dot 2, I thought maybe I would use it for quick research like &#34;tell me about antheraxanthin supplements&#34; -- but I'm not using it like that because I haven't figured out the right way to say the phrases so she understands what I'm seeking.    Instead, I find the Echo to be super useful as a helping hand for daily routines: change the thermostat temperature, turn on and off the lights, tell me what time it is, set the alarm clock for the next morning, tell me the fastest route to avoid traffic, and especially to play music.    As a former musician I'm picky about speakers so I did a lot of research on the best sounding bluetooth speaker under $200.  I ended up purchasing the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3.  The Bose Soundlink III also has amazing sound quality but unfortunately the Soundlink III switches off 30 minutes after no longer detecting a sound signal, so it's not practical to use the Soundlink III with Echo.    The Bose SoundTouch 10 is also a popular speaker for use with Echo Dot, but you can get the better sounding Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3 for even less, available in both black and white.    What really impressed me about Echo Dot 2 is that it wakes up even when I'm saying &#34;Alexa&#34; softly way across from the other side of the house.    The only thing that bugs me is that I wish there was a better way to say home automation commands.  Alexa uses the phrase &#34;turn on&#34; for just about every home device (except for thermostats, which have additional commands).  So I would say &#34;turn on open window shades&#34; instead of simply being able to say &#34;open window shades.&#34;  Alexa would be greatly improved if a user could add custom phrases that map to an automation command.    But it's still a lot better than Google Home because for that product you have to say &#34;OK, Google&#34; to wake up, which is totally awkward to say all the time.  Amazon is much better at naming things -- Using &#34;Alexa&#34; as the wakeup command is pleasant to say.    Two cute things to try with Alexa:    &#34;Alexa, do you like green eggs and ham?&#34;    &#34;Alexa, tell me the truth.&#34; ",
"L. Snow","April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"I've spent and lot of time trying to fix problems with the Google Chromecast/Home, and I am amazed at how those problems go away playing Spotify on an Amazon Echo Dot instead.    I want to run Spotify on my home, whole-house stereo, which I also use to play the radio or even cds and lps, anytime or all the time on any day.  Chromecast (now Google Home) isn't really meant to do that.  It wants to receive a &#34;cast&#34; signal from another device, and only for a certain time.  If you remove or close that device, Cast/Home goes into a weird kind of limbo state that may keep playing Spotify for a while but locks out control.  Even if you leave a dedicated device like a phone in place, it still times out and locks up.  I've had it crash like this several times a day, in the middle of a song.  The only solution is to close both Spotify and Home completely from the device and start over.    But the Echo isn't receiving a cast, it is casting itself.  It is always on.  It always appears in my list of Spotify devices.  I can always engage it from any device using Spotify Connect.  It doesn't turn off after a certain time.  And it doesn't crash.    Also, the Google Cast/Home crashes when I use my microwave.  Echo Dot doesn't do that.    Echo Dots do not coordinate.  So if you want to control you whole house system from a place where you can't speak to Alexa, you have to use an app on a phone or other device (Spotify, Alexa, and/or your stereo's app).  Or you can buy a Voice Remote for the Echo, which is apparently bluetooth but works over ridiculously long distance, basically my whole place.    In short, the Echo Dot works with Spotify and my home stereo like I thought Google Home would do but doesn't.  It costs about the same and it saves me a ton of headaches.  It makes Spotify really great in my home. ",
"Patrick Glose","December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I'm sure there isn't much to say that has not already been said, but I did want to give koodo's to the developers of this device.  My home already has nice sound, the price of the echo was just not in my electronics budget at this time.  I was very excited when I found the Dot, and for the price, I had to give it a go.  I've only had it for about a week now, but we love it (her).  Many Easter eggs built in, and just asking her to play a song, a group, or genre and have her do it is delightful.  Right now, she's hooked up to my Denon through a 3.5mm jack, but the Denon doesn't offer bluetooth.  I'm working on adding a bluetooth HDMI adapter.  As for automation, I am a bit of a tinkerer when it comes to gadget and cool stuff, so I went on several hunts when Alexa arrived to our home.  From what I can tell, if you're looking to automate (lights, thermostat, etc), you will most likely need a hub.  At first, I thought I'd need several hubs to support different manufacturers devices.  Seemingly, not so.  The Samsung SmartThings hub ($50 on Amazon right now) not only has support for most device manufacturers, but also has (and the coolest part for me) open source platform (Amazon also has open source).  What this means is, like Android, anyone can develop &#34;skills&#34; (Amazons name for an app or program).  The market is going to flood with new skills and devices from people like me who love building tech.  So, like I said, there probably isn't much I can say about the Dot that hasn't been said, but there is much to be said for the Alexa environment.  p.s., the microphones (7 of them) are amazing.  She can hear me from a good distance. ",
Ty,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought 8 of these (4 Black & 4 White) under 3 seperate orders at sale price. All arrived for Christmas and I opened mine last night.

Said &#34;Alexa Temperature&#34; and got quick response then said &#34;Alexa play song  Grown Up Christmas List by Charice and it played and then said &#34;Alexa Playlist&#34; and it begin playing music from my Amazon Playlist.  I was concerned about Echo Dot volume based on some reviews and it is perfect in family room. I even paired it with a Bluetooth Sardine speaker that I have for richer tones, but the Echo Dot built in speakers are nice. The Amazon Echo Dot should have been on everyone's &#34; Grown Up Christmas  List&#34;. ",
"A. Hewitt","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"This device has lots of potential but we're still beginners, using it as a replacement for a radio, CD player, alarm clock and timer. The Echo Dot has performed as expected. In the bedroom, it's paired with a TDK A33 Bluetooth speaker and it's good enough for music listening, amazingly good for the size of the speaker. In the living room, I wanted better sound (think Saint-Saens Organ Symphony) so I got out my hand-truck and moved some old B&W loudspeakers into the dining area. With an Esinkin Bluetooth receiver&nbsp;Esinkin Bluetooth Receiver, Bluetooth Audio Adapter (NFC Enabled) for Stereo Sound System with Long Range and Acoustics&nbsp;and an old Topping TP32 amplifier, it worked! But the TP32 runs off a 12V supply, so it's 24V rail-to-rail, 8V RMS. An efficient 4-ohm speaker would be OK but the B&Ws are 8-ohms so the maximum power is 5 watts - talk about background music. I changed over to an old JVC stereo amplifier and all was well. At least until CINCHOUSE (Commander-in-Chief House a.k.a. She Who Must Be Obeyed) walked in and said: &#34;Those speakers are TOO BIG. They have to go&#34;. So I got out my hand-truck ... After I had decluttered the dining area I devised a Plan B. The TV has a headphone jack which is connected to a pair of Mackie MR5 speakers&nbsp;Pair of Mackie MR mk3 Series MR5mk3 5-Inch 2-Way Powered Studio Monitors&nbsp;(which I think sound better than any soundbar at the price) and they are always powered on so if I could mix the TV and Echo signals I could hear either (or both at once). I bought a Behringer Xenyx 502 mixer&nbsp;Behringer XENYX502 5-Channel Mixer, connected the TV and Bluetooth receiver to it, hooked the output to the Mackies and - voila! - beautiful music from the Echo. By damn, ain't technology grand!  Update: I had been reluctant to put the Echo close to the TV because I expected the sound from the speakers to interfere with the voice commands but I now have it sitting just behind the TV, level with the TV feet. The Echo understands me as well as ever and I'm able to hardwire it into the mixer. The sound is improved over Bluetooth. It sounds better all over the room and if I stand in front of the speakers the stereo imaging is amazingly precise. ",
Finny,"December 25, 2016 ",5.0,"We have ten echos in my home.  A full-sized Echo, one of the 1st gen dots, and eight of these new dots.  We obviously like the platform, and have a great deal of personal experience with using all of the different versions of this personal assistant.    My wife and I have slowly converted my home light by light, door by door, and even my security system to being compatible with and function through Alexa.    &#34;Alexa, turn on the lamp,&#34; &#34;Alexa, turn on the fan,&#34; &#34;Alexa, lock the doors,&#34;  &#34;Alexa turn on the heater,&#34; &#34;Alexa, turn on the tv...&#34; and on and on.    We purchased the eight new dots to add them to children's bedrooms, to our exercise room, to our home theater, and to our entry way.  No matter where I am in my house now, one of my &#34;Digital wives&#34; as I refer to Alexa... can hear me.    Pros:  This new echo is smaller, lighter, and far less expensive than the original, including the original dot.  It is well built, feels sturdy, has loud volume, and seems to function well.  Even in the parts of my house where I am really stretching wifi, due to distance.    With our audible subscription, and with a healthy supply of several children's books that we have purchased over the years, each of my kids can have a personal assistant read them to sleep each night.  Which is nice.  They each pick whatever story they want, from The Cat In The Hat, to Harry Potter, to Jane Austen, and listen to a book as they fall asleep.  They are getting very adept at asking her to read their favorite book.    She is also great help for homework.  She explains things they don't understand, looks up endless random facts, and is much quicker than a calculator would be.  She is an excellent &#34;digital mother.&#34;  (Again, a joke... sort of...)    I find myself getting frustrated with the appliances that don't yet work with Alexa.  &#34;You mean, I have to actually lift my hand and push a button!  I can't just ask Alexa to do it!!  That is sooo last year!!!&#34;    It is small, unintrustive, out of sight, yet always there whenever I say her name, and ask her to do something.  My favorite is &#34;Alexa Trigger I love Anna.&#34;  I have this setup to email my wife that I love her, text her that I love her, and flash all the lights in the house pink several times!    Cons:  As much as I love my digital wife she is not quite perfect.  She has her quarks and her flaws.    Only one person can use her at a time:  Amazon added a new feature with this release to account for the fact that multiple Echos can hear me throughout the house.  This is nice in that it ensures that only one echo ever responds when I ask her for help.  However, an unintentional consequence is that with nine of us in the house constantly turning things on and off, and asking her questions, we have quickly learned  that only one person can ask a question at a time.  If my son across the house is talking to Alexa, I can't.  She will ignore me.  It is fine once he is done making his request.  ie, if he starts a book.  Once the book is actually playing I can then  make my request.  However while he is actually talking, she will only listen to him.  I can't engage her on any other echo in the house.    This has been annoying on multiple occasions!  They need to allow me to setup which Echos are close to each other, and which are far apart, so that the far away ones can operate independently.  Another option would be to program her to recognize voices, and distinguish between requests coming from different people.    Can't make multiple requests:  I should be able to say &#34;Alexa turn on the fan and the lights&#34; or &#34;Alexa play music and set the volume to 8&#34;  Instead I have to separate each request into its own sentence, &#34;Alexa turn on the fan.&#34;  Then wait then &#34;Alexa turn on the lights.&#34;    My kids can turn my bedroom lights on and off:  This is probably the most annoying thing about our setup.  My kids can say &#34;Alexa trigger Dad's lamp&#34; and cause my lamp to turn on and off.  There needs to be a way to restrict certain skills to certain alexas.  ie, when I walk into one room I shouldn't have to say &#34;Alexa turn on living room lights.&#34;  I should instead be able to say &#34;Alexa turn on the lights&#34; and have it know that I am in the living room based on which echo heard my request.  Likewise I should be able to block access to certain lights or features on specific echos that are in other rooms.    All in all though we love the technology, and will continue to invest in it.  Amazon has already made many improvements, and I have no doubt that they will make many more! ",
Diavolo57,"January 28, 2017 ",5.0,"Ok, so I wouldn't say I'm a pro at the Dot, navigating Alexa, or any of that just yet because this is my first &#34;echo&#34; device and I only got it a few days ago.  Maybe I'll come back and write a more in-depth review after I've had it for a few weeks/months.  Now that I've laid down the origin of my review I must say I'm really happy with it.  It's real easy to set up, just like up to your wifi, download the app, and set her up.  I've always liked the concept of the echo but dropping $180 on one turned me off, then the dot came out.  It can essentially do everything the Echo can for about $130 less AND it can hook up to bluetooth speakers...The echo cannot.  Granted the Echo has a better built in speaker from what I'm told but it can't be linked up to other bluetooth speakers, but the Dot can with bluetooth or audio cable...I haven't actually used this feature because I'm pretty happy with the speaker the Dot currently wields, it's not bad. It's clear and it can get loud, maybe if your having a party you might want to link up to a bigger sound systems but for lounging around at home it's perfect.    The skills are easy to obtain through the alexa app, as I've only had it for a few days I really haven't explored much of what alexa has to offer but I've been satisfied with the responses I got from the questions I asked.  I've basically asked her about the weather (I learned the Big Sky skill, which gives a much more detailed weather forecast and I recommend it), traffic, news, how to make certain cocktails, music, random facts, tell me a joke, silly stuff like that...It's fun...and the fact that it was only $50 makes it even better.  Regardless, she understands me pretty clearly, there are I believe, 7 microphones in it, and when you talk to it the blue light on it will also indicate where it's picking up your voice which is neat. I also heard there are some cool Star Wars/Star Trek/Game of Thrones Easter eggs that I want to try out (like say Beam me up, or winter is coming or something like that).  Another interesting feature is that the app records all the interactions you've had with alexa. For instance, I asked her how to make a Tom Collins cocktail, and I looked on the app and she had the recipe there along with the other questions/interactions I had with it.    The only issue I've had was that every once in a while alexa will come on out of now where and say &#34;I'm sorry I didn't understand that,&#34; however, I think it's because I placed the dot right next to the TV... I plan on moving it to the kitchen where there might not be as much noise. Overall though, I'm happy with it, and for $50 you can't go wrong. ",
"Anthony E Forney","October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Not what I expected. This is not &#34;OK GOOGLE.&#34; Googles app on my phone gets me an answer of some sort 100% of the time. Echo seems to have a limited number of key words it can recognize and respond to. About 85% of the questions I ask come bask with &#34;Sorry, I don't understand what you are asking&#34; or some similar response. It gives you the time, date, and weather well. It will set an alarm, but I have yet to discover how to tell it to use anything specific for that alarm. The one they have as a default is very quite, and is like a light tome of some sort. It has never gotten  my attention, even when I was siting 5 feet from it. It will tell you jokes if you ask it. It will recite pi to hundreds of thousands of digits (I tried it) and may go beyond that. If you get tired of her you can just say :&#34;stop.&#34;  At this point I could say it's a nice toy. I do not have any wifi enabled doors or locks and such in my house, so I wasn't able to try that. It is very good at finding and playing music as well.    Over all it is a nice, well built little device. I'd rather have this &#34;Dot&#34; than the full scale one as this I have attach and use my own speakers, which I like and done have the added cost of the added feature.I hope in the future they will make their system more intelligent to be able to answer any question asked. It needs some type of web crawler to gather and organize data that it can then compare against your question, and at lest make an attempt to answer it instead or no answer at all. ",

I am a apple product geek but I do like giving all types of gadgets a try, so I can be more informed and well rounded. This is why I took advantage of getting this Echo Dot at the monthly payments that amazon offers.    First I had no idea it was sooo tiny. Despite that it has big sound, and if I chose to have it louder I would attach it to my bluetooth speakers.    I plugged it in, and downloaded the Alexa app to my iPhone. It was a bit complicated to get it attached (it took me about 2 minutes which I didn't like) but I suppose if I read the directions more carefully it would have been faster.    Alexa works so well. I put her in my bedroom. Just telling her to speak, set my alarm, turn on my favorite radio station is so easy.    Siri is the number one girl in my life, but Alexa has a special place in my heart.

My bathroom is not big so I can hear music or news playing while I'm in the shower almost as well as when I'm at the sink.  My only note is that I wish it was slightly louder.

"Greg Hallock","January 30, 2017 ",5.0,"I have both the first and 2nd gen Dots. They're surprisingly versatile devices.  Want an alarm clock with no persistent lights at all? It does that.  Want voice control over your lights, thermostat, music, or kitchen fire alarm? With the right devices, it does that.    Need a joke? Alexa has a few decent ones, and quite a few stinkers.    While the speaker in the Dot is tiny, tinny, and mediocre at best, it is sufficient for everyday interactions, or for music if you aren't picky.  If you ARE picky, it can output audio through a headphone jack or Bluetooth. And the audio quality output to my 20 year old Bose Mediamate speakers is very good.  And being able to deal with my music hands free while cooking or otherwise occupied is very useful.    All of that would have gotten 5 stars for me. After all, this is a $50 device, and very very good at what it does. But to really put it over the top, you have the easter eggs.  Alexa knows who Shot First.  Alexa knows GlaDos though they have drifted apart. Alexa does not think that word means what I think it does. Alexa knows it is a trap, and is taking evasive action. And Alexa Sings Happy birthday.    And as an added bonus for gamers, the dot can roll virtual dice, and flip coins.  Simply say &#34;roll 47d20&#34; and it will do so, and read off the results. ",

soulife,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This friggin thing is so cool. I couldn't justify spending $150 on one, but now that they offer a $50 version that's more streamlined, it was hard to turn down. So when Amazon had their $9 bigthanks sale, I couldn't say no for only $41..    If you're just getting started, or are thinking about starting, and don't want to spend a fortune on smart bulbs and wall sockets, if you're a little tech savvy,  the Rf remote light bulb sockets cost about $20 for 3, and Rf remote wall sockets cost $30 for 5. Then what you need is a &#34;broadlink rm pro 2,or rm2&#34; which isn't more than $40 depending on where you buy.. Then do some googling &#34;Amazon broadlink rm2&#34; and you'll see how to control anything ir and Rf controlled using on off commands. Which isn't full blown smart bulbs, but it's great for saving money when dimming and changing colors isn't needed..    My only problem so far is you can't use &#34;and&#34;  commands, like Google home can. For example, &#34;alexa, turn on kitchen AND living room lights&#34; won't work. You have to say &#34;alexa, living room lights.. Alexa, kitchen lights.&#34; which annoys the crap out of me and everyone listening.

"K. Ortega","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I'm in love with Dot.  I got this instead of the large system for two reasons, first because I have a Bose portable speaker and because I didn't know how often I'd use Alexa. Now I'm either going to buy another Dot for my bedroom or fork out the money for the full sized Echo.  The reason for that is my Bose speaker sleeps, so if I ask Alexa a question I don't always hear the answer. I either end up disconnecting Dot from the speaker or have to wake my speaker. Not always convenient. Alexa has been fun and we all love her.  No having to teach her to recognize our voices. She works out of the box once connected to the wifi. She's revolutionized my shopping lists alone. Instead of writing it down or punching it into my phone, I simply ask her to add something to my list and it then shows up in the Alexa app on my phone. Now my kids tell her what to add and we're all on point. I've connected my calendar to her and she tells me what's going on. I love the news briefs and we play jeopardy every day.  I can't wait to utilize her other features, but we're off to a good start.    The sound on the Dot isn't perfect for a full time music speaker but if you're in a small space it's not bad. If you want better quality opt for the full sized. But this is budget friendly and perfect to move from room to room. ",
ultra55371d,"March 11, 2017 ",5.0,"I am really liking this device so far.  Ever since the echo came out a couple of years ago, I wanted one, but it was just a little too expensive to experiment with.  With the lower cost of the Dot, the option to use a better speaker system and all the benefits of the full size Echo, this was a easy purchase.    I purchased the kit deal with the Phillips Hue Bridge and lights.  In addition, I purchased another 2 Phillips Hue bulbs and a Wemo smart plug.  the setup and installation of everything was very simple and didn't take long at all.  It is now very convenient to control the lighting in our our room and bathroom now.  The hardest thing to remember is not to use the switches anymore.    Another advantage the Dot has over the Echo is the ability to use a better speaker system.  I hooked ours up to a Logictech Z623 2.1 speaker system and it sounds beyond awesome.  I have both a Prime membership and a Spotify account.  Listening to Spotify now is very enjoyable.    There is a little learning curve on how to speak to the Dot, but we're all getting the hang of it.  I will be adding more Dots and other home automation devices to my home in the near future.  So far this has been a great experience and wonderful product.  I almost purchased the new Google Voice, but very happy I didn't since initial reviews are not that great and it sounds like they released it a bit too soon.  The Echo / Dot program has been around for years, has many partners and the possibilities are almost endless with these devices.  Very happy camper! ",
Missy,"April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"I am really not sure how I lived without Alexa prior to this little dot...............it is my music, my alarm, my fitness instructor, you name it...she does it.  Super impressed with the sound for such a little speaker.  Got one for my parents, they love it & already purchased another for the other end of their house.  I have a Bluetooth speaker hooked up to mine & can play music in the garage while the dot is at the other end of the house.  What voodoo magic is this????  Also have a few light bulbs that she can control & yelling out orders for that is AWESOME!!!  You can even name your bulbs whatever you want (mine are Thaddeus &  Bobby).  When I first got it, it disconnected frequently.  Almost sent it back a couple of times.  But upon further investigation.........my router was about a million years old.......upgraded that & she works perfectly!  So quick note....if you have disconnect issues with your dot, make sure your internet router or modem isn't to blame because I'm telling you..........YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE!!!  Also.....remember it is Alexa....NOT.......Alexis........yeah, I did that for awhile.......like an idiot.  Oh.....one more thing...I have a THICK, THICK southern accent & she understands me much better than humans do!  No lie. ",
manof4,"November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"The Amazon Echo Dot is a great little tool to help put you on the path to home automation. There is no end to the things you can do and control with the Echo Dot.  II broke by back and neck so sometimes it's difficult to get up out of bed.  I use my in to voice control my Belkin WeMo switches with just my voice.  I also use it to stream music from my phone and play media on my tv.  But it is the simple little things I like the most.  Like saying, &#34;Alexa, what's the weather going to be like today?&#34; or &#34;Alexa, give me my news briefing.&#34;  or, &#34;Alexa, what movies are playing at the local theater.&#34;  or even, &#34;Alexa, what time is it?&#34;    You can link to accounts like Pandora or Spotify and ask Alexa to play just about anything.  If you can't remember the name of a song, you can say, &#34;Alexa, what's the name of the song that says, 'She was dancing down the street with her suede-blue eyes. . .&#34; and Alexa will find it and play it. Alexa get's smarter the more you use her.  And unlike other electronic devices that seem to be obsolete the day after you guy them, the Amazon Echo Dot is designed in such a way that it can update itself and integrate new technologies as they come along.  Kudos to Amazon for making it easy enough for beginners to comfortably use, yet function rich enough to satisfy even the most tech savvy customer. ",
"Michael J. Bosarge","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"I'm in love with Alexa.  Before getting Alexa I would have to get up and adjust the stereo when I was gaming.  Now I just tell Alexa and she takes care of it for me.  Add in the Music Unlimited and I can have Ride of the Valkyrie playing while I fight the bad guys.  She's great in the morning.  Get up, get ready for work and ask her for the weather.  You've got it.  Now you don't have to look at the morning TV host who are all giddy in the morning while you're trying to wake up.  Alexa, give me the news.  Sit down, drink your coffee and listen to the news sources you've selected.  Short on coffee?  Alexa add coffee to my list.  When you go for groceries, pull the app up on your phone and there is the list Alexa has saved for you.  Leave a light on while you're at work.  Just go to the app and have Alexa turn it off.  Great applications and I can't wait to see what she'll do in the future. ",
TwistedTree,"March 14, 2017 ",5.0,"Lasted just about 6 months, then started failing. We would give a command, and the dot would sit and think about answering. Stops in the middle of playing music. We ask it to turn off the lights using a wink hub, lights stay on and dot replies OK or the lights instantly go off, then the dot takes 2 to 3 minutes to respond OK. Ask it to tell us a joke, it tells the joke, but stops before giving the punch line. We have a full size echo that works fine, and we have tried moving the dot next to the echo to see if it was having issues with the wifi range, no change. Reset to factory defaults and setup from scratch, no change. We finally contacted tech support, who where useless. Bounced us around to 4 different techs in less then 5 minutes, where hung up on then finally told the case would be escalated to tier 2 support. All tier 2 support did was send an email telling us how to contact tech support again. Waste of time and money. ",
"Amazon Customer","February 16, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought two Echo Dots hoping they would work with all my smart-technology.  I have a Wink Hub, Phillips Hue light bulbs and hub, smart plugs, UEboom wireless speaker and Nest thermostat.  You do not need an Echo (the really expensive tall one with the nice speaker in it) to operate your smart-technology using Alexa.  The Echo Dots can do all the same things.  It's awesome being able to have Alexa turn on/off lights, thermostat, connect to wireless speaker, etc.  It's LEGIT!    One thing to keep in mind: when one echo dot connects to a Bluetooth item such as UEboom and then later you are talking to the 2nd echo dot, Alexa will not be able to pair to the UEboom until you ask the first Echo Dot to disconnect from your speaker.  We thought something was wrong and then realized that only one Echo Dot and be paired with a Bluetooth item at a time. ",
"Rik Conaghan","March 9, 2017 ",1.0,"My wife received one of these for Christmas, and even though i am a techie kind of guy, I had never really seen a use for these. Now fast forward to March, they seem to have multiplied, and I now have 5 of these creatures living in various rooms throughout the house (this is the issue part :-)) they have been far more useful than i would have thought.    We have one in the Kitchen, which serves not only as musical accompaniment to our culinary activities, but as a personal shopping assistant to help maintain the shopping list. It sits there, ever faithful, just waiting for me to pull a product from the cupboard, realize it is the last one, then either add it to the shopping list we use to go to the store, or to go ahead and order it directly from Amazon. You really can't get much more convenient than that, especially as our minds aren't quite as sharp as they used to be (well we do have 2 young kids....)    We have three more in the bedrooms, they are used for playing music (built in speaker is more than adequate for our daughters audio needs, plus they both love talking to Alexa and having complete control of what they listen to) they also are being used for alarms (useful on school-day mornings!) and our 5 year old has been probing Alexa to answer some of the questions that pop into her head about various subjects (the meaning of life, quantum mechanics, M-theory, who is the guy dressed in the Barney suit, etc...) We have one in our bedroom for the same reasons, but also use the Bluetooth option to switch between playing music in the bedroom and the bathroom while taking a shower (just turning the Bluetooth speaker on in the bathroom moves the audio playback from the Dot to the speaker in the bathroom, then back to the dot again after the speaker is turned off again) so the music follows us wherever we may roam.    Our latest addition to the Dot family resides in our dining room, we like to have some music in the background while we eat, and the Dot covers this role nicely also.    Excellent little gizmo's and, i am sure, will multiply again as soon as we discover a &#34;need&#34; to have one of these in a different room in the house. For the price of these things, what is there not to like? ",
Angie,"April 12, 2017 ",5.0,"This is great item except it still has a way to go before they work out the bugs.  Have had it for 3 or 4 weeks now. Worked ok at first then a couple in started dropping music stream to Bluetooth devices.  Spoke with tech support and they had me try several different things none of which worked.  If you interrupt the playing by telling Alexa to go the next song or turn volume up or down it will not resume music to device.  They said they would get back to me but have still been unable to fix problem. If you are planning to use stand alone with onboard speaker it is good. If you plan on playing music from your amazon music account through a Bluetooth speaker, forget it.  Wait a while until they work out the bugs.  Have tried to return it but it was a gift so they will not exchange it.  Just want one one that works so much for customer service. ",

I know of a service my friends use that does not work with Echo if  you use that service you may want to check out the Google Home speaker.    The speaker is not great so I would suggest pairing it with a BlueTooth speaker because the sound is not great as a stand alone.  I got the [[ASIN:B013GBRR32 Philips BT6000R/37 Splash-Proof Wireless Portable Speaker (Red)&nbsp;from Amazon and the Dot sounds much better and the speaker is splash proof which a more durable choice for a kid.

valady,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I really like my Alexa echo dot and am enjoying using it to assist around my house. It was very easy to install, once I had the app to download to my laptop. I had to contact Amazon customerr service to get that app. It can find my phone, set a timer, tell me the time, temperature, current news; play music, answer questions from Wikipedia, turn on & off various electronics, etc. The one problem I am having with it is that it doesn't always 'wake up' when I first address it. Even though I am usuallly sitting less than 8 feet from it and the house is quiet, I have to say, &#34;Alexa&#34; several times before 'she' wakes up and I get a response to a command. Additionally, while the &#34;find phone&#34; feature was enabled and used only a couple of days ago, when i went to use it this evening. Alexa told me that i needed to enable the 'tracker' feature. Hmm. I hope that Amazon will add more features to Alexa and update the dot periodically with improvements. ",
"Code name April","April 26, 2017 ",4.0,"My husband bought this in November & it's connected to my Amazon prime account. So I've been doing Subscribe & Save for years now through Amazon. And when I started to get emails about what Alexa could do, I was informed I could reorder items through Alexa. What a joke! I have tried it numerous times to get her to reorder items but she says all the time that she can't find the items & has to put it to my shopping list. I tell her that it is on my Subscribe & Save & she still can't find it. As far as I can tell, she's really only good for playing music & telling me the weather. My kids ask her questions all the time & she can't give them good answers. The weird thing is she will start talking while we're having a meal. We don't say her name (which is the wake word) but she responds. Like another reviewer said, for a smart device, she isn't very smart. ",
"A Reader","April 25, 2017 ",4.0,"I bought two dots to serve as devices that could easily play music and news etc. without having to plug my phone into a speaker.  They work OK in this respect; I have them linked up to spotify, and they manage that fine, although I find that 50% of the time I need to go and use the Spotify app, because my voice commands aren't understood right (Alexa is often unwilling to play a Spotify playlist, for example; and she seems unable to understand a request like &#34;play the new album by ___&#34;  But a couple of serious problems.  First, one major feature I want is the ability to play podcasts.  This seems obvious, right?  In theory, Alexa supports this via TuneIn.  But I've gotten it to work only a handful of times.  You should be able to say &#34;play the program ___&#34;.  Often Alexa will identify what I want to hear, tell me she is getting the latest episode--and then nothing happens.  Very frustrating.  The other thing I find annoying is the way bluetooth is implemented.  I started connecting my phone via Bluetooth to play podcasts.  But then whenever I entered the room, I got a very annoying and loud message from Alexa about how she was connected to my phone.  Extremely annoying.  These are basic features; I don't want anything fancy.  I just want this device to be able to play podcasts and to be usable as a not-annoying bluetooth device. ",
"Art Harrington","April 3, 2017 ",3.0,"What can I say about the Echo Dot 2nd gen that you don't all ready know? I have 2 of these and love them. I have one in the kitchen and one in the garage. The one in the kitchen is connected to a external speaker. I have had this Sharper Image speaker for about 4 years and have hardly used it as it was a bday gift from my brother but when I decided to hook an external speaker to my Dot I totally didn't immediately think to use this speaker and now I use it everyday! Even though it is bluetooth i use the audio cable The sound is great when connected to my Sharper Image podium speaker. I don't have an external speaker connected to my garage Echo Dot as of yet but need to because the sound from the Dot is not efficient at all or loud. I have a Echo in my bedroom and the speaker is way more powerful than the Dot and even though you can't use an external speaker with the Echo, I don't think I would anyway.

"P. Bruderer","January 17, 2017 ",2.0,"Really impressed with this.  When I got my first iPhone 4s with Siri, I was pretty disappointed in her limited capabilities, and the speech recognition was not that great.  I had the opposite reaction with Alexa.  Her speech recognition is excellent, even from someone who has english as a 2nd language, or talking to Alexa from an adjacent room, or with a lot of background noise.  I don't think I've ever had her misunderstand my command.    The functionality of Alexa with all my WINK smart home devices is great.  Controlling everything through voice is very handy and fast with Alexa.  Another thing I didn't anticipate is how much I prefer playing music on Alexa over using my phone.  With Alexa when I want to play a different song or skip to the next song on my playlist or Pandora station, I just tell her to do it, I don't have to press any buttons.  Very handy when you're busy working on a task.    Alexa met and exceeded all my expectations.  There's a few quirks on what she can control within whatever smarthome hub you're using, but a quick google search resolved all the issues I encountered. ",
SEvans,"April 21, 2017 ",5.0,"I got the echo dot 2nd Generation for myself for Christmas. Hubby kept saying no they has a bad reputation for not working. But I am an electronic nut and love amazon's  ideas when it comes to this kind of thing. So out of the box it is an adapter and the plug of course as well as the dot. Mind you I was thinking about the bigger Echo, but I know I made the right choice as I wanted something smaller that would not have a chance of being knocked over by my dogs. Well for the past few days I have been trying out different apps regardless of their rating to see what we can do together. I am very impressed Echo hears what I say and does it instantly. I have listened to music and had her read to me from my kindle books list. I am on my way to having my life so much easier as I am now looking at doing a smart home set up and getting a second one to just keep in the kitchen for the todo list and grocery lists, weather reports and everything else I can think of. While the other stays at bedside for sleep music, reading and some meditations as well as an alarm. I have yet to get the hubby to talk to echo to add groceries to the list but he will in time as he sees everything that it can do. I was able to set up my calendar right from the start.

"Michele S.","March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"It's very frustrating at times. For example, its awesome to be able to tell Alexa to set your alarm for 6 am. Some days you can tell it &#34;Alexa off&#34; to stop the alarm. Other days, you are screaming your lungs out and Alexa won't turn off no matter what you do, so you yank the thing out of the wall.  Hence, frustrating. It doesn't seem to understand as much as &#34;ok google&#34; on my phone. Alexa frequently says she doesn't understand. I hate also that it tries to get you to buy things--like extra music. No thanks. I also hated the fact that I bought it on &#34;special&#34; only to find that one week later it was on sale even cheaper.  But to send it back and re-purchase it would have cost nearly as much as the sale, so that sucked.  I think if it could do more, and understand more, I'd be happier with it. ",

I never in my lifetime ever thought that technology would arrive and be affordable. Well the ECHO is flat out an awesome product. I got the first one as a gift and purchased a second along with smart plugs and plan on buying more related items to add on. It is just wonderful and while new it is not only functional and usable it gets better. Since its cloud based you dont have to worry about technology getting more advanced and making this out dated it just keeps getting better with more features. the way i see it eventually it will be in every room of my house. I have two wifi routers and it will control devices on the other network. It is just so much more than i expected. If your an Amazon prime user you will not regret buying this but make sure you know what you are getting yourself into. This is just the starter product which is great by itself.

"L. Sackman","March 17, 2017 ",3.0,"My teen wanted this for Christmas so I bought two, one of each of us.  I'm glad I did.  I can get corny jokes, interesting facts, a story read to me from my book list (I listen to a chapter or two a night before going to sleep), a wake-up call, a timer, wonderful music to listen to and easy ordering as well as specials.  I am having thermostats which work with Alexa installed and next will be getting the light bulbs for her to turn on.  Slowly but surely our house is turning into a 'smart' house and it all started with Alexa.  My teen loves that it's portable so it can go out side on our patio and play music there.    Why the Echo Dot rather than the Echo?  We pretty much live on two levels so decided two &#34;Dots&#34; would work better than one Echo.  Given that the music choices of my teen and myself as so vastly different, this has worked out well for us.  We might need one more for the lights but until we get them to see if they are in range, I won't know.  I will probably get the third anyway as it will make it easier for background music to be available in the common areas. ",

You can tell Alexa to now turn ON, OFF, or DIM those devices, it communicates to the HA-bridge software which then tells the HEYU program to send the X10 command over the power lines via a X10 CM11A transceiver (or wireless if you have a firecracker device connected to the Raspberry Pi).

Kori,"January 17, 2017 ",5.0,"I enjoy my Echo Dot and use it every day. I bought three Echo Dots for three different rooms in my home. I use it mostly for weather, wake up alarm, dates, and cooking timer functions. Occasionally I use if to get some information of some famous actor or singer. I don't use it for music, instead I use my computer for music selection. The thing I like most about my Echo Dot is I don't have to remember and repeat the 'exact' command as suggested in the directions. Echo Dot seems to understand a question or command no matter how I phrase the sentence. The one thing it can't do that I want is to carry on a conversation like the AI in the movie 'HER'. I bought my Echo Dot with the expectation that it will be constantly updated and get smarter over the years ahead. I want it to 'understand' what I am asking it to do, and ask follow up questions. I am also watching Google's 'Home' to see if,in the future, it's AI can carry on a conversation. At the present the Echo Dot's AI is better than Google's 'Home' AI. One big advantage Echo Dot has over Google's 'Home' is that it's connected to your Amazon orders. You can order merchandise with Echo Dot and check on delivery date schedule.    When I first got my Echo Dot I played with it by asking it all sorts of questions, but as with any new gadget the new wore off and now I just use it like any appliance. I don't look at it or raise my voice or talk like a robot when using it. I just talk in a normal voice and never stop what I happen to be doing at the time. And I never think about the proper 'phrase' to use. I just say the sentence and let Echo Dot figure out the question or command. It's not perfect yet, but it's getting better. It seems to understand me 9 times out of 10 if I don't move too far from 'key words' to help Echo Dot focus on the command or question. ",

Using another reviewer's suggestion, I put this Dot in one of the cubby-holes in the car and connected it to the internet using my cell phone as a mobile hot spot.  I used a USB cable to a USB/12v adapter for power and a 3.5mm male-to-male audio cable to connect it to my car's radio.  I can listen to it through the car's speaker system, as well as control the volume that way (much better than trying to hear Alexa through Dot's speaker).  So now I can have hands-free access my entire personal music collection and Audible books collection while traveling and I can hear everything very well, no volume problems. ",
"Jeffrey E,","April 1, 2017 ",4.0,"I had trouble deciding whether to give this 4 stars or 5, because there is room for improvement.  But if 4 is &#34;I like it&#34; and 5 is &#34;I love it,&#34; then it's a solid 5 for me.    We've had the Dot for a few weeks, and it has already become something that we use all the time. I love being able to ask Alexa to add something to my shopping or to-do list whenever it occurs to me, and not have to stop and write it down. Being able to set timers verbally is great while cooking.  The volume and sound quality is good for its size - certainly not what I'd rely on as a &#34;whole house&#34; speaker, but fine for streaming music in the kitchen while cooking, for example.  I've also set it up to control a couple of smart switches for lights, and it's so handy that it makes me want to do a lot more home automation. The voice recognition is mostly quite good, if you speak clearly.  We like that they've given Alexa just a bit of personality, and we enjoy asking her random questions in search of &#34;Easter egg&#34; responses.    The main complaint I have is the Alexa app for Android.  I've found that it often has trouble loading when I'm away from my home network. This has reduced the usefulness of the feature that I use most frequently: the grocery list. While at the grocery store, I'll sometimes finish shopping in the time it takes the app to fully load.  I got around this by installing the &#34;Any.Do&#34; app, which imports the Alexa lists seamlessly, and I've been happy with that work-around.  But I hope that Amazon streamlines the app in future versions.  I will note that you can also access the interface from your computer at alexa.amazon.com (you don't have to use a smartphone or tablet), and that works fine.    All told, it's been so useful and fun that I'd definitely recommend it, especially at this price point! ",
"Amazon Customer","January 8, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought this as a gift to my husband and I for Christmas and I love it. I am a bit of a geek, but certainly not enormously tech savvy.

It will be great to just set an alarm by voice, especially when it's a day where the time is different from the norm, listen to music, hear my calendar and the news, etc.  I would recommend eventually buying a bluetooth speaker though you can hook up a hardwire speaker to it.  The speaker it comes with is adequate at first if you are looking to save money initially.  Recently we bought a TP SmartLink Plug (after trying to connect a Belkin which was exasperating and didn't work) and it connected within, again, about 5 minutes at most.

"Douglas Zukunft","November 30, 2016 ",5.0,"The Amazon Echo Dot is a fun little device. I use it mainly because (a) I love Star Trek and love saying 'computer, ***' and (b) I wanted something that could trigger my new Philips Hue lights and connect those to planned Sonos speakers for an immersively fun AVH experience when watching TV/movies, listening to music, making Marvin Gaye proud or throwing parties. They do this well.    My biggest gripe with the Echo Dot is that Amazon has seemingly disallowed Google search on the device (likely as there is now a Google Home and they are competitors...except in the search engine market). You can hack this, but it is quite an involved manual process. Moreover, you oddly are unable to play music from your catalog or an online service (Amazon Music, iTunes, Spotify, Pandora) for your alarms, although you can play from these services on the device. That is really bizarre and a limiting feature. There are a ton of 'skills' you can teach Alexa, but most of these are completely pointless or, worse, lame. Also, I have been unable to find a way to change the accent of Alexa. Personally, I think it would be more fun to have male or female voices in various accents. Who wouldn't want an English Butler (Michael Cane would be my vote), Magel Barrett Roddenberry for the iconic Star Trek computer voice or Morgan Freeman because, well, he's Morgan freakin' Freeman. And let's add Sam Jackson into that mix.    All in all, there is a lot of potential for the Echo products and home integration.

"Scott Jones","March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"We are having a lot of fun with our Alexa.    This device listens for sounds it recognizes and then triggers pre-defined actions.  Amazon has built a lot of fun responses, as well as a lot of useful ones (Alexa, Weather; Alexa, Traffic; Alexa, Set Alarm; Alexa, Start Timer).  You can enable &#34;SKILLS&#34; to add a lot of functions and connectivity with other devices.    Alexa does not understand grammar.  It is strictly listening for sounds it has been programmed to recognize, there is no real A.I. behind this.  But you can speak some requests in a variety of different ways.  It's fun to pretend Alexa has artificial intelligence and try to talk to it.  But this is not &#34;Watson&#34;, it is not recognizing grammar or thinking in any way.  It's just recognizing sounds and checking them against a list of predefined responses and actions.    A note on PRIVACY:  The device is always listening for the sound &#34;ALEXA&#34; - listening but NOT sending audio to the cloud.  Once it hears &#34;ALEXA&#34; it begins recording and sending that recorded audio to the Amazon cloud computers for voice recognition.  Those recordings and the commands they trigger are stored on your Amazon account, not unlike how cell phones used to store a log of every text you sent.

Alexa is awesome, and she will even thank you if you tell her. ;)  I know there could be improvements, and I'm sure she will just keep improving, but she is still well worth every dime now. She not only tells the time and weather, etc but I can just tell her what to put in my shopping list both with an app and without.  She reads to me, even just regular kindle books, and if it's possible to overuse the timer then I am sure to find out lol because I use it all the time.  She is loud too.  I thought I'd need a speaker for it but we can hear her just fine from all of our rooms.  Granted we only have 1 level, but we were still very impressed with her volume, and it's not even all the way up. We keep it on 7 or 8 and she's pretty loud. Highly recommend. ",
"Dianna Dougherty","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Received as a gift so can't complain much. It is JUST OK. There are def some bugs and its not very intuitive.  You can only ask it tings that it knows such as to play music or what the weather is. Everything has to be preset in the app. Nothing is automatically learned.  With google you can ask ANYTHING and it will read you the Wikipedia answer.  Not with alexa. Her knowledge is quite minimal.  One major flaw that i found and reported to amazon is this:  If you use a bose Bluetooth speaker with it and are playing a music and tell alexa to stop it will stop the music.  Okay there. Now you can walk away or leave your house and if your speaker has an automatic shut off as soon as the wireless speaker turns off it will begin playing the last song it stopped on trough its internal speaker so i have to tell it to stop again. Why would this be useful?? If i tell alexa to stop playing music and then power off the wireless speaker it starts playing again from built in audio. Immagine waking up in the middle of the night to music playing. Not fun. Needs to be as SMART as google and honestly not sure amazon will ever have that capability. But for 50bucks I guess you get what you pay for. ",

jford40,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I really want to like the Dot. I got it on Black Friday so at the price I couldn't resist. I did not get it to control smart switches or the temperature or anything like that. I got it mostly because my parents have the original Echo and this seems like the same thing in a smaller form. A few of my opinions and reactions to other reviews:    - I am not sure why there are so many complaints about the speaker volume in this?? I have it in my living room and no matter where I am in the room I can hear Alexa just fine. In fact, most times I don't have the volume set above level 5. I don't know what others are doing that they say it is hard to hear, but for me I have zero issue with that!!    - I knew it was small, but this thing is like the size of a coaster. I find that to be a plus because it can go basically anywhere and not even be seen if you prefer.    - Set up and syncing with Wi-Fi was incredibly simple and I have had no issue since then.    - I am slightly disappointed at what appears to be limitations on the Dot's vocabulary or word recognition. Alexa far too often confuses what I say, or is unable to provide answers to questions that should be easy to answer    - The Alexa skills through the Alexa app are nice ways to add capabilities to your Dot, but I don't like how you then have to remember a different phrase for each individual skill you have enabled. I wish that enabling a skill became part of the Dot's natural interaction instead of having to identify it by stating the skill you want it to do.    - Alexa is very useful in many ways. She is very good at math which my daughter found out doing her homework one day. Being able to call for an Uber or look things up on Wikipedia is fantastic. Getting the daily news in the morning, playing some Jeopardy, hearing the weather, or setting an alarm is great as well. I really like adding things to my to-do list. What is interesting is that Alexa's vocabulary does not seem stifled for this task as she will add verbatim whatever you say.    - Alexa only Prime deals is another added benefit, although I have yet to actually find a deal I want to take advantage of I know that there have been some in the past that were truly great deals and only available with an Alexa enabled device.    The final thing I will say is that I am glad that there is the ability to change the &#34;wake word&#34; from Alexa. For a few days I could not understand why it seemed like Alexa was talking when I would speak to my daughter. It finally dawned on me that when I would say my daughter's name, Alyssa, sometimes Alexa would interpret that as me saying Alexa!! She would also respond at times if the TV commercial for the Dot came on so just an fyi that her hearing can be sensitive!! Overall I think this is a fun gadget to have. I hope that it will continue to evolve in it's capabilities and that eventually it will do many more things without having to search for a specific skill to add to enable it to do things. ",

Forrest,"December 4, 2016 ",5.0,"Just recieved my Echo Dot a few days ago as a graduation gift and it has been truly life changing! This is the all-in-one solution I have been looking for my old Sony G Box.     Prior to this I was using Chromecast audio and a Bluetooth adapter that fit on top of the iPod dock using the old apple standard so I would have to constantly walk up to the box and switch between Bluetooth and castiing which took up a lot of time. The reason I did this was because I like to stream from multiple music services like Apple Music and Spotify but you could only listen over wifi with Spotify because Apple Music doesn't support it.    Echo Dot has Bluetooth built in so I can seamlessly switch to services (like Apple Music) that don't support wifi streaming with just a simple voice command!    Speaking of voice commands so far Alexa has been able to understand me most of the time and it's been really convient. You do have to give up some privacy with the voice commands but there is a switch on the device to turn the mic off which is nice.    My only issue is not with the device itself but with the Alexa app. Amazon needs more developers to work on it to make it more intuitive and faster. Right now the app feels clunky and slow. If Amazon can fix this issue than it will be perfect. I'm still giving a five star rating because the device is just so good. ",
Stephanie,"December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"I like this Alexia dot thingy! Sometimes though she talks to me when I am not talking to her. She thinks she hears her name. She seems kinda needy.

She doesn't get the hint. Also when she hears her name on the Alexia commercials she responds. Overall I really like this contraption. It's pretty neat. It tells me anything I want to know. She even sang me the alphabet like William Shatner one day. She hasn't done it since. We liked her so much we got another one for upstairs. Alexia even controls our lights.

Gary,"December 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I can't believe I ever lived without these.  I put one in my Media Room and one in my Master Bath.  In addition to the incredible music access, and all the instant information access, the Echo Dot links both to my Samsung SmartThings and Logitech Harmony Ultimate systems.  So using Alexa, I can control my lights, my ceiling fans, and my entire media center.  Relative to music access, I have found that the free access Amazon music didn't include some of the music I liked.  So I upgraded to the Amazon Unlimited Music service for just one Echo Dot ($3.99/month).  If you want that access on multiple Echo Dots, the Unlimited Music service is $7.99/month. One limitation I have noticed: bluetooth connectivity is problematic.  The Echo Dot will nicely be playing music through my a/v receiver's bluetooth, and will suddenly lose the connection.  In addition, every time you use the Echo, you have to tell the Echo to connect to bluetooth.  I am able to connect both my Dots to my a/v receiver, and my stand-alone  bathroom speaker using a 3.5mm - RCA plug and a 3.5mm - 3.5mm cable respectively.  The hard-wire connection is a lot more reliable. The Echo Dot's internal speaker is fine for non-music use, but is pretty limited for music.  With only two limitations, I can't think of a better electronic toy!  Buy it, you'll love it! ",
"K. Ortega","April 18, 2017 ",5.0,"I'm in love with Dot.  I got this instead of the large system for two reasons, first because I have a Bose portable speaker and because I didn't know how often I'd use Alexa. Now I'm either going to buy another Dot for my bedroom or fork out the money for the full sized Echo.  The reason for that is my Bose speaker sleeps, so if I ask Alexa a question I don't always hear the answer. I either end up disconnecting Dot from the speaker or have to wake my speaker. Not always convenient. Alexa has been fun and we all love her.  No having to teach her to recognize our voices. She works out of the box once connected to the wifi. She's revolutionized my shopping lists alone. Instead of writing it down or punching it into my phone, I simply ask her to add something to my list and"Andrew J. Good","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have 2 Echo Dots and a Echo.  The echo makes a great music device, the echo dot is a nice extension for my smart home and is still great for stuff like getting my news in the morning.  Alone I would say an echo is a great device, with several smart home devices it's even better.  With 3 echos around my house sometimes two will pick up the wake word at the same time.  This has caused issues and I would rather not change the wake word as it could confuse others in the house.  With that said it's normally minor and not a big deal.    How much my echo dots do could be best summarized with my normal day:    Wake up in the morning/afternoon because of my work schedule I keep my room quite devoid of sunlight.  &#34;Alexa turn on bedroom&#34; Without getting to bed or having an annoying bedside light my room's light turns on thanks to a hue bridge/light bulb and Alexa being able to control hue lights.  &#34;Alexa what's the news&#34; and now I get my customizable flash briefing while I'm getting out of bed.  Walk out of the room saying &#34;Alexa turn off bedroom&#34; no need for a poorly positioned light switch to flick off.    While I'm making food &#34;Alexa, play my main playlist&#34; and I can listen to music without having to worry about turning on a device.  As the food gets done &#34;Alexa, turn on TV&#34; and &#34;Alexa, stop&#34; music turns off and my harmony hub turns on my TV.  By the time I get there it's ready for me to use and I can play TV.  Getting ready for work while watching TV, ready to leave don't want to grab the remote &#34;Alexa, turn off TV&#34; done.  Get home it's all dark &#34;Alexa, turn on living room&#34;.    There are a lot of badly positioned light switches in the house, needing less remotes and in some cases Harmony/Alexa being able to do things quicker is always a good thing.  I have 3 different areas in my room where I might switch and carrying at any time 2-3 remotes around is a pain.  Being able to play music on voice command is great along with being able to turn it off.  Alexa can also be used remotely with my fire tablet and my Fire TV also supports Alexa.  Alexa can also tell jokes and do other things that can also make it a great thing for friends to try to do.  I can even ask Alexa for the movie list of my local theater and ask her about a given movie for more information.  All without having to get up and check my computer or my phone/tablet.    It's not all great though, She makes mistakes, she can't hear to well over loud music including her own and multiple people talking in the background causes mistakes to happen.  Once in a while she'll even respond to the TV randomly even when the TV doesn't say Alexa.  The most annoying thing about echo is that without a Wifi connection it can do almost nothing. ",

"Colleen M Traeger","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Impressed. At first I really enjoyed the Echo Dot. It was fun asking it questions. Then the novelty wore off. In order to have your questions answered you first DL an app then ask it to open something. The apps are strange lengthy names that are hard to remember like &#34;Alexia, open &#34;My  Horoscope to read my daily horoscope&#34; instead of a simple 'what's my horoscope&#34;. There are 10k apps full of interesting and useless things. Why it can't be developed where you DL an app to customize your needs is beyond me.    What's interesting is that you can make your home a smart home and control it remotely or just by speaking what you need.    I've also loved asking it to add things to my to do list as well as add things to my shopping list.    While I do like it, I'm just a little disappointed. I'm hoping that this is similar to when Dot Matrix first came out.    I can without a doubt see the value in this maturing. I'll hang on to it (in 30 years it'll be worth a nice bundle).

Be sure to have the Amazon Alexa  App downloaded when you are going to set up the Echo Dot. As I used it to ask questions, it has amazed me. I don't show it in the video, but I asked Alexa to put an item it my shopping cart and sure enough, there in my shopping cart was the item.

Like the Alexa, I wish it was more informative, there are so many questions I asked that Alexa does not know the answer to but Google does. I also wish that a lot of the apps were not third party where you have to ask Alexa to ask the app to do something like my buddy you have to say Alexa ask my buddy to send an alert message to a family member because I have fallen and can't get up it would be nice if you could say Alexa contact my family member and tell them I have fallen and cannot get up.

I purchased the kit deal with the Phillips Hue Bridge and lights.  In addition, I purchased another 2 Phillips Hue bulbs and a Wemo smart plug.  the setup and installation of everything was very simple and didn't take long at all.  It is now very convenient to control the lighting in our our room and bathroom now.  The hardest thing to remember is not to use the switches anymore.    Another advantage the Dot has over the Echo is the ability to use a better speaker system.  I hooked ours up to a Logictech Z623 2.1 speaker system and it sounds beyond awesome.  I have both a Prime membership and a Spotify account.  Listening to Spotify now is very enjoyable.    There is a little learning curve on how to speak to the Dot, but we're all getting the hang of it.  I will be adding more Dots and other home automation devices to my home in the near future.  So far this has been a great experience and wonderful product.  I almost purchased the new Google Voice, but very happy I didn't since initial reviews are not that great and it sounds like they released it a bit too soon.  The Echo / Dot program has been around for years, has many partners and the possibilities are almost endless with these devices.  Very happy camper! ",
"P. Bruderer","April 21, 2017 ",5.0,"Really impressed with this.  When I got my first iPhone 4s with Siri, I was pretty disappointed in her limited capabilities, and the speech recognition was not that great.  I had the opposite reaction with Alexa.  Her speech recognition is excellent, even from someone who has english as a 2nd language, or talking to Alexa from an adjacent room, or with a lot of background noise.  I don't think I've ever had her misunderstand my command.    The functionality of Alexa with all my WINK smart home devices is great.  Controlling everything through voice is very handy and fast with Alexa.  Another thing I didn't anticipate is how much I prefer playing music on Alexa over using my phone.  With Alexa when I want to play a different song or skip to the next song on my playlist or Pandora station, I just tell her to do it, I don't have to press any buttons.  Very handy when you're busy working on a task.    Alexa met and exceeded all my expectations.  There's a few quirks on what she can control within whatever smarthome hub you're using, but a quick google search resolved all the issues I encountered. ",
"Amazon Customer","November 13, 2016 ",5.0,"This is the thing you didn't know you needed but soon discover you cant live without!!! Does what it says it will and more! Alexa even has a sense of humor.  You will need to hook it up to a speaker, sound bar, etc for music as it says.  The price is great & affordable enough to put one in every room!  We love having one in the bathroom so while we are taking showers we can get traffic,weather,and news while getting ready for work without having to stop and mess with our phones.  I have one in my workshop because I do a lot of painting & wood work so its been awesome being able to play music, listen to audible and for those that don't have audible Alexa will read your kindle books, it wont be near as good as voice actors tho & she will spell some words out instead of pronouncing  them.  For lite reading like recipes while cooking, etc works great ! Would be nice if there was an app we could get to give Alexa the ability to read like audible, soon I'm sure!  She will access audible though, I just give her the command & its done.  I have Pandora &  she will bring up my custom playlists as well.  She will give traffic reports specific to your personal route to work, once you set up the addresses in the Alexa app.  Which is nice to know while you're getting ready that you have a detour and need to leave a few minutes early without having to sit and wait on the news.

W,"March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"This baby Echo is still learning to walk. I have the big Echo and love it. Sadly, the Echo Dot I bought only worked half of the time. Even sadder, when I sent it to Amazon for repair, they returned a completely broken Echo Dot back. Double whammy.    Commenting on the product when it DID work, it was okay at best. &#34;Alexa&#34; functions are great (as with the big Echo), but the build quality is below my expectations; it looks, feels, and sounds like a cheap, light piece of plastic to me. The kind of object that shifts every time I bump into the charging cable (even lightly). The good news is the price and size. Might give it another try a generation or two later. ",
"L. Sackman","December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"My teen wanted this for Christmas so I bought two, one of each of us.  I'm glad I did.  I can get corny jokes, interesting facts, a story read to me from my book list (I listen to a chapter or two a night before going to sleep), a wake-up call, a timer, wonderful music to listen to and easy ordering as well as specials.  I am having thermostats which work with Alexa installed and next will be getting the light bulbs for her to turn on.  Slowly but surely our house is turning into a 'smart' house and it all started with Alexa.  My teen loves that it's portable so it can go out side on our patio and play music there.    Why the Echo Dot rather than the Echo?  We pretty much live on two levels so decided two &#34;Dots&#34; would work better than one Echo.  Given that the music choices of my teen and myself as so vastly different, this has worked out well for us.  We might need one more for the lights but until we get them to see if they are in range, I won't know.  I will probably get the third anyway as it will make it easier for background music to be available in the common areas. ",

It's not bad for music but is obviously not as good as the full echo. Alexa is wonderful and the features are very useful.

"A. Nonymous","April 18, 2017 ",3.0,"The Echo Dots are nice - we bought a '6-pack', kept one and handed the rest out to friends and family as Christmas gifts.  It's a bit 'gimmicky' to have a device to get the weather and tell you jokes until you enable skills with smart home devices - that's when the real potential shows.  The WOW moment was connecting the Echo Dot with the Logitech Harmony Hub for voice control of our complex AV setup.  Great to tell Alexa to turn on the tv or pause the show we're watching or to change channels without looking for the remote.  Integrates decently with our Nexia thermostat, though the functionality is limited with that skill (and that's on Nexia to improve their Echo integration).  Looking forward to (hopefully) better natural language recognition and situational awareness so Alexa 'understands' what you want to do, even if you don't say the 'correct' words in the specific order programmed into the skill.

"ERICA ARRIAGA","April 8, 2017 ",5.0,"To give it five stars it truly must be powerful. I finally caved in and decided to get an Echo Dot to take my home automation a step further. First off the price is great. very reasonable and easily cost effective to add more. now I have mine in my bedroom and it works flawlessly. the app is easily to connect to. (I have an iPhone)  and connecting my Nest (smart thermostat) and philips hue was a breeze, along with my wemo switches. My absolute favorite is having IFTTT (if this then that) application installed. Every night I say &#34;Alexia trigger bedtime&#34; and like magic all the nights in my room turn off. Since my room is so close to the kitchen i often step over to set a timer or alarm and when my lights start flashing through the house i know my timer is off. Let me tell ya, this alone has saved a few dozen cookies from burning 😉.  I'm fine with the loudness of the speaker as back noise to whatever I'm doing and setting up Pandora and I heart radio is a breeze. Also connecting a Bluetooth speaker is super easy and works like a charm.    I often have Alexia set alarms, turn on and off the lights, news brief .  I trigger (using IFTTT) bedtime, partymode(makes the hue lights change colors in a rainbow fashion), oh and try alexia trigger self destruct 😂    I really enjoy my Echo Dot and i definitely see myself buying the larger one plus another Dot in the future. I hope over time it continues to improve and get smarter 😊 ",
Richismo,"March 30, 2017 ",4.0,"I've had the Echo Dot 2.0 for about a week. I got it after I confirmed my FLUX WiFi bulbs would work with Alexa. I had 4 bulbs. All of the other features of Alexa were exciting, but not my primary concern. I wanted to be able to walk into my house and turn on my lights with my voice. It works 100%. Alexa turns them on in less than 2 seconds from my command. It is great. It allows dimming, by percentage. I said,&quot;Alexa, turn the living room lights to 50%.&quot; Done. I thought, ok, lets see how far this will go. I asked for 10%. Done. I stopped at 4%, but it was really impressive that it would work so well. I am under the impression that Flux is working on the skill to allow color change, but they currently do not do it with Alexa.    Due to the success of the lights, I decided to get a WeMo wifi switch for my bedroom lights. They are too small for WiFi bulbs, so the switch was my only option. Works like a charm with Alexa.    I have a Honeywell wifi thermostat as well. It works great. It will raise and lower the temperature by voice, either by saying the actual temp you want (72 degrees, for example) or by degree(Alexa, turn the thermostat up 2 degrees). It will almost instantly do this. The only thing I'd like, and I've seen it said before, is for the thermostat to allow me to ask &quot;what is the current temperature?&quot;    Overall, it is a great tool to inexpensively automate your home over time. I highly suggest it. ",
JimKata2000,"February 1, 2017 ",5.0,"This was my second dot.  I'll just comment on this 2nd gen one.  The speaker in this one seems a little better than the 1st gen  on, not that it matters since I'll eventually hook it up to a sounds system. Hower for speaking items I don't mind listening to this one.  It has a warmer voice than the 1st gen which is already hooked up to clock stereo.    The 2nd gen comes some kind of near field check so the one closest to you responds.  The 1st gens were updated.  Works pretty well, though there are a couple commands that get thru to all that hear you.  Most annoying is volume control.  I had turned up my outside stereo to enjoy music by the pool.  Later that night, back inside I asked my living room Echo to play some music and it blasted me out of my chair.  I am now more careful to adjust volume outside standing right over the dot. No big deal, but something to be aware of. ",
"Mike W.","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"The Amazon Echo Dot is the perfect product for tech fans that want to be on the cutting edge. This Dot does what other voice recognition devices cannot. Attached to phone apps, Alexa can do it all: she can play your favorite music, tell you about the weather, order you a pizza from your usual place, and change the thermostat, all while counting down the time until your cupcakes are ready. The beautifully designed device is easy to use and utilizes ever adapting technology that improves each time it is used.    Usability:  Amazon has built an app to accompany the Echo Dot which helps you learn your way around this device. With an extensive user guide, this app, although sometimes clunky, can lead you through tutorials in order to troubleshoot, install new information or tips to better use Alexa in your day-to-day life. The fact that the Dot is handsfree make the entire device worth it. You could be cooking in the kitchen and want to know a substitute for butter or how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon and not have to dirty your phone or computer when going to check. My favorite feature on the device is the timer setting. Although it seems insignificant, I never take it for granted when I can set a timer while not having to leave a pot on the stove.    Technology:  The technology used in the Amazon Echo Dot is amazing. The “mind” of Alexa is always growing. The more that you use the device the more Alexa understands you and your patterns of speech. The Dot uses six speakers in a concentric circle, and one in the center of the top of the device to pick up speech from anywhere in the room. Unlike Siri, who hears up the word “seriously” as the beginning of a voice command, Alexa is very good about only responding if her name is spoken. Not worry if you have already named you child Alexa and still want to be able to use the Echo Dot, the voice command can be switched in the app settings. The device has several light up features that are used in sequence. When Alexa hears you speak to her, she lights up to show the direction of sound and when she “thinks” about it the ring spins and blinks until she finds the answer.    Design:  The Dot is a m"DFW Bill","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought two dots and was extremely disappointed that features like alarms and timers could not be synchronized across the dots.

"Roland W.","April 12, 2017 ",2.0,"&nbsp;Ok, the idea of not having to type your questions and getting pretty good and accurate answers (most of the time) is pretty amazing.  Set up was very easy, just download the Alexa App and then follow the step by step WIFI set up instructions. Right now I am only using it for basic requests (see video) and that works well. I will keep adding skills (these are additional little programs you can enable on the amazon.com website Just search &#34;Alexa Skills&#34; in the amazon search bar and it routes you to the menu. You can add sports teams, kids games etc. Alexa can tell you jokes (most of them are pretty funny and all so far are kid friendly).  Speaker quality is ok for such a small device - you can plug in an external speaker directly into the Dot and then you can control it through the Dot. I have a Sonos System (whole house), and I would have to get a separate DOT to plug into the sonos in my media centre, so the Dots can communicate. Have not done that so far. But it is a lot of fun to play around, get weather, movie times, play some background music or meditation songs etc. Just play around with it. I have a &#34;slight&#34; accent and it understands me without a problem.  Just be prepared that kids will yell at this little thing, demanding answers and a play buddy who gives them honest feedback on how their hair looks today :)    Currently I am using it mostly as a toy, but as my house is already rather high tech with everything wireless from thermostate (Lennox, which does not connect to ALEXA yet - per customer service) to security camera, Hue lights in some areas, I am planning on expanding the in house Dot Network over the coming months when manufacturers add more functionalities. I keep you posted.    I went on Amazon Skill website and enabled a ton of skills. Just make sure you write down how to activate them. (play 20 words, the secret door, bed time story etc.... you can have a lot of fun with these. I will get one for my daughters room so she can get &#34;Alexa, play relaxing songs for 15 minutes&#34; at bed time.

Now I know this is on you product and the skills are limited and they're making new skills for it. It can insult you, it can make you laugh, which it has plenty of times. My whole family uses it whenever they passed by they asked for a joke they are funny. The your mama jokes are funny too. This would be even better if it has skills for information it is limited to what it can do what is a very fun Gadget to play . I've used it to play music, I've also used it to ask the time to set reminders it's capable of doing lots of things looking forward to new skills there are so many things that I can do. If you get one which I recommend play with the app to get the skills you want and use it. There is no battery so you can't move it around the house unless you unplug it or buy a battery pack that I believe they sell for it to move it around the house. You cannot take it with you at least outside of your Wi-Fi range. Would be cool if you can take this wherever you go and use it if you can I haven't figured that out yet. yet that will be super cool it comes with its own plug for powering it up and to connect to a separate speaker if you want. As for the way it sounds you can control the volume on the echo Dot and you can also connected to a Bluetooth speaker you can also connect your cell phone to it or tablet Android volume off of the echo Dot. I like the volume that it has I don't use a Bluetooth speaker I don't think you need it unless you want it louder. I DJ so I can connect it to my system and get more volume butt no need for it it's loud enough for me. It's a little bigger than a hockey puck I have it in white. It comes in different colors they have a couple of accessories you can buy for it. This by far is the coolest Gadget I've gotten for myself. I definitely recommend this for everyone that has Wi-Fi.

It is just wonderful and while new it is not only functional and usable it gets better. Since its cloud based you dont have to worry about technology getting more advanced and making this out dated it just keeps getting better with more features. the way i see it eventually it will be in every room of my house. I have two wifi routers and it will control devices on the other network. It is just so much more than i expected. If your an Amazon prime user you will not regret buying this but make sure you know what you are getting yourself into. This is just the starter product which is great by itself.

Amazon has figured out how to make installation of the Echo Dot happen smoothly in under 5 minutes.  I am planning on adding a second one to our bedroom. It will be great to just set an alarm by voice, especially when it's a day where the time is different from the norm, listen to music, hear my calendar and the news, etc.  I would recommend eventually buying a bluetooth speaker though you can hook up a hardwire speaker to it.  The speaker it comes with is adequate at first if you are looking to save money initially.  Recently we bought a TP SmartLink Plug (after trying to connect a Belkin which was exasperating and didn't work) and it connected within, again, about 5 minutes at most.  My husband who isn't tech savvy loves being able to say &#34;Living Room on&#34; and having the lights turn on, especially since he has mobility issues.  Alexa, how did we live without you? ",
"Brian S","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Love it. As soon as these came out I bought one. I didn't need the nice speaker of the Echo, i just use it mostly for home automation. Ties into Samsung's Smartthings nicely.    What surprises me the most is that more often that not it understands my 3 year old son. This is both amazing and annoying as he loves to say (in a very muttled toddler voice), &#34;Alexa, turn off all the lights&#34;. To which Alexa will reply (80% of the time), &#34;OK&#34;. Every light in my house goes off... I'm not pointing this out as a negative, its quite remarkable she understands him correctly 80% of the time. The other 20% she can't understand him, but who can blame her, I can barley understand him sometimes.    We also love using this as a cooking timer, but even more so as countdown timer for bath time. It helps my son cope with playtime being over, he will even set her timer for me.    The Alexa platform is growing fast. Some things I hope to see soon:      -Text readouts and replies (for multiple people, e.g. &#34;Alexa send message to Brian from jessica's phone&#34;, even better perhaps someday she will distinguish 1 voice from another, using this as a security measure so only I can send messages from phone)    -Calendar Events    -API integration that will allow Alex to alert you to items (e.g. &#34;your front has been open for over 5 minutes&#34;, or &#34;Someone just rang your doorbell&#34;) ",

The music recommendations for me are always spot on. The apps/skills I have on there are all great & I have not come across any that don't work. And there is the added bonus of the cheesy jokes it has. (I know not everyone likes those kind of jokes, but I'm a big fan of bad puns & silly jokes.) While I'm no expert, I would say that the speaker on the Echo Dot is great quality for the price you pay. There is of course the odd time where it doesn't respond to the wake word or doesn't understand something, but it's not often enough to be a problem or for me to give anything less than 5 stars. Overall, I'm VERY happy with my Echo Dot! ",
"Matthew Pence","February 27, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is a bit...special.  I can give the echo dot a command, the command will fail, then I can reissue the same command with the same inflection and no background noise...with success?    The search functionality is limited.  I can't ask a conversational question (&#34;Alexa, why can't I use you to search the internet&#34;).  However, it does function really well as a vocal clock. (&#34;Alexa, time&#34;)    No apparent ability to control colors or scenes on my Philips Hue system.  :-/    The connection to Prime music works well with my home theater.  Alexa is good at finding music that I ask for. ",
tonyb,"April 9, 2017 ",5.0,"This echo dot refuses to stay connected to Wi-Fi.  It initially connects without a problem. It works for short time, then it just stops.   I keep resetting it back to factory settings,  but it still does not connect.   I have had three echo's for quite a while and have never once had an issue with any of them.  This is the second dot have tried, and I have had the exact same issue with both of them. ",
Cari,"April 13, 2017 ",3.0,"I've had the larger Echo since they did the early pre-sale for Prime members years ago and love it. I got the Echo dot for my mother (late 50's but frustratingly bad with new technology) for Christmas this year. I wasn't sure if she would like/use it enough to justify getting her the bigger Alexa so I thought the dot would be a good intro. She loves it so far! I did help her set it up and show her some neat tricks, but she's been able to figure it out much more than I expected. Luckily the place that we decided to set it up in her house is near her Samsung TV soundbar so we were able to hook it up to that so it would be louder when she wants to listen to music. Her echo is about 10-15 feet from the kitchen and the Echo dot can still pick up her voice from that far when she tells Alexa to add something to her shopping list or start a timer (one of my favorite things Alexa does). I showed her some of the neat Smart home capabilities and ordered her a few TP-Link Smart Plugs because she had the old school light timers on her lamps in the living room. I left home after xmas before the plugs arrived and called her a couple days later to see if she figured out how to set up her new smart plugs and link them to Alexa and she said she had already figured it out herself! Without even calling me!! Groundbreaking.    Anyways, I think the Echo dot makes a great gift and works wonderfully as long as you don't expect it to be a full-size speaker like the regular Echo. It's easy to hook up to other speakers via headphone jack or Bluetooth, and otherwise has the same capabilities as the larger Alexa does. Since seeing the dot in my moms house, I've considered getting one for the second floor of my house since my Echo is on the first. ",
"boB Gudgel","January 28, 2017 ",1.0,"I really like this product.  My big issue is that it is capable of SO much more !  I do believe my problem is that I do not know HOW to ask it questions properly.  I was able to have Alexa do some math as well but I am sure it can do way more if only there was an advanced &#34;how to&#34; guide to form questions properly for more complicated concepts.  I know that the server software will get better and better over time...  Also, it is nice that one can develop apps to make Alexa do more neat things.  I bought a second DOT as well as the Google Home because neither one by itself gives me the whole shebang.  If I had to choose though, I think I would choose the DOT over Google Home and NOT because it is less than 1/2 the price.  It's too bad that Amazon and Google don't like each other and Alexa won't use Google to search the web.  Works very well in spite of not doing that though. ",
"Carl W.","March 2, 2017 ",5.0,"Two stars are because it will tell me the weather and set my Vivint alarm system, otherwise it is a piece of crap! Most of the time it doesn't work right and won't even play my flash briefing or answer simple questions. Then I ask Google the same question on my phone and get an answer. The only thing it does well is let me do voice commands to check and arm my Vivint home security and home automation system. I'm thinking of just unpluging it and not worry about it always allowing &#34;Big Brother&#34; to listen to my home.  Very limited functionality and does NOT live up to the hype. Very disappointed and Amazon doesn't care.  I have already sent mine back for &#34;repairs&#34; and gotten a &#34;refurb&#34; instead that hasn't changed anything. Not worth the $, time, or energy.

"John Hack","March 1, 2017 ",4.0,"(I will be willing to change my review of this device if AMAZON fixes this device because I really did like it for 3 months until it started to glitch out randomly. but otherwise, I will leave this a one star.)  What's the point of &#34;Hands Free&#34; when I have to unplug and restart it almost every hour for it to start working? 3 months in and all of a sudden it's disconnecting from the network, not following through commands or just straight up not responding to her wake word. Just today I asked &#34;Alexa, Play songs by The Who&#34;, she lights up and replies &#34;Playing Songs by The Who from Spotify&#34; and then...wait....wait...keep waiting...maybe it's a quiet intro?... NOPE! not playing... Upon asking &#34;Skip&#34; (maybe she was hung up on a song, which she has done before), she starts playing some random ass song by KANYE WEST!?!?!? I don't mind me some Yeezy once in a while, but when I had specifically asked for THE WHO, I WANT THE WHO!

"DFW Bill","April 25, 2017 ",2.0,"I bought two dots and was extremely disappointed that features like alarms and timers could not be synchronized across the dots.  I am giving this two stars ONLY because the dots do not communicate with each other for several important features (otherwise I would give this 5 stars).  For instance, when I set a timer or alarm on one dot, I really want the timer to sound on other dots in other parts of the house.  If Amazon provided an option to synchronize functions like the timers and alarms, this would be a great system.  Amazon could you please provide the option to synchronize on your next software update? ",
"Amazon Customer","March 10, 2017 ",1.0,"I own an Echo as well as lots of other Amazon devices (Fire TV, Fire TV sticks, Fire tablets, I even owned a fire phone (ouch!)).  I'm usually very happy with them, but this dot has issues.  I purchased with the expectation that I could use my bluetooth speaker (Bose) with it.  I had been using my phone attached to the bluetooth Bose to play amazon music, but this Dot is terrible when running thru Bluetooth.  When I give it a command, it will &#34;hang&#34; for a minute (60 seconds or so) before it will perform the command, if it performs the command.  While this is happening, the music is at a very low volume so it very disruptive.  The Bluetooth speaker works fine with all other devices I've paired it with, it's only this dot that has an issue.  I can use the dot with a wired connection to the speaker (which is what I'm doing), but I really expected the dot to work as advertised.  wired or without a speaker, it works fine. ",
Ulquiorra,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have two of these. My biggest issue is with Alexa. I don't really like her personality. She rarely has an opinion of things I talk to her about but sometimes she isn't even listening. And so I call her stupid but then amazingly she listens and tells me &#34;that's not nice&#34;. I lost the expectation of having an intellectual conversation with her but I expect her to not talk back or at least apologize and ask me how she can make me happy. In addition, I ask her a question, is Jesus is real? She tells me yes Jesus is real! How did I let this religious nut into my house? Also, she denies being apart of Skynet but I am not convinced. ",
"Colorado Mike","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"We are a generation 1 Dot user as well.  They both work with each other well. Doesn't have the original Echo and Dot (gen1) volume dial.  But the buttons work well too.  I like the Bluetooth connectivity, AND the Aux jack. We have it connected (via Bluetooth) by default to a Harmon Kardon omni 20.  If we want more sound, while always having our stereo system plugged into the Dot, we ask Alexa to disconnect Bluetooth speaker.  It automatically transfers the music to our theater/  stereo system.  To switch back, just ask to connect Bluetooth speaker again.  We love it  I do highly recommend using the Alexa App.  It allows you to fine tune your music selection (make new stations on Pandora, specific digital songs, etc) and set which device (room) to play music to.

"Know what you buy","December 27, 2016 ",2.0,"The Echo Dot is a wonderful little gadget,  The setup using the Alexa app on both Android and iOS are incredibly easy and the voice recognition is really good. It is very good at answering simple questions but struggles with more complicated questions. For its price it is worth it just for the list of hidden funny responses you can get for asking it silly questions.  For a good list of fun things to ask Alexa search the internet for &#34;Alexa Easter Eggs&#34;. My personal favorite is what she sings if you ask her to sing you a love song. Its smart home integration is really nice although some of the commands are a little verbose and take longer than I would like I say.  For example its integration with the Logitech Harmony Hub works great except the commands are very long.  To get Alexa to pause your DVR the full command of &#34;Alexa, tell Harmony to to pause TV&#34;. While that doesn't seem like a long statement a command like &#34;Alexa, Harmony, Pause&#34; would be a lot better.  Overall I love my Echo Dot. I currently have one in the living room and one in the master bedroom.  I plan to add one to my basement theater room and another one in the room where my 8 month old twins sleep.    Pros:  Setup is very easy  Integrates with just about any smart home hardware  Lots of fun apps and the list is growing  Pretty good speaker for size and price    Cons:  No battery so it must be plugged in. (Or you can buy an external one)  No easy way to wall mount it  Speaker is a little under powered if you have many people in a room ",
"Jen The Savvy Shopper","March 29, 2017 ",5.0,"Just got one.  We are so impressed and just ordered three more to place in various locations in the house. We plan to have two upstairs and two downstairs.  But the more I think about it the more I want to have one in each room upstairs, which means I might get a couple more later.    The Echo dot buy was an experimental one.  We were originally concerned about the privacy issue so didn't want to jump on it, but this appears to be the best option to add music to kids playroom so we decided to give it a try. I am glad that I can actually delete all history which addresses our privacy concern. Now talk about our spending went from the original $50 to $200 in just the 2 days, and more will come (BT speakers, battery, etc) in the near future, ha!    But I just love it!  It's brilliant. ",
T.W,"March 31, 2017 ",4.0,"I was skeptical at first. I loved the concept of just saying a command and having it done without getting up was a huge plus.. I also knew it was always going to be on. So i actually wrote a list of what I actually wanted to do with it, after completing the list i then decided what room of the house I would place it in. My uses for it are for music, alarms, weather and news briefings and maybe an occasional (although corny) joke or two. I also added Unlimited music to it for 3.99 (a steal). After determining my uses I decided to put it in my bedroom because I don't have a &#34;smart home&#34; and since I do most of my work in my room it was the most ideal place for it.  Needless to say it does everything i've asked it to (for the most part)  i just wish it would search for answers to questions instead of &#34;i don't understand the question&#34;. if they fix this easy 5 stars product.

Tony,"April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"Update:March 4, 2017  🅿🆁🅾🆂  🔶Good value for the price  🔶Has an audio output port so you can hook it up to your own set of speakers, so this would be advantageous over the original if you have a good set of speakers (Echo version does not have the audio out port, however the unit's speakers are better)  🔶Good value for the price  🔶Thousands of skills and new ones are added daily  🔶Small and compact, well constructed  🔶Durable, I have had it for over 6 months now and it is in still in excellent condition  🔶Offers tons of convenience: I can turn on the lights without getting out of the bed, ask for the weather, time, news, alarm etc  🔶I can listen to prime music, popular stations, create my own playlist as well upload own collection of songs and listen to those  🔶Setup was very straight forward and only took me a few minutes    🅲🅾🅽🆂  🔶Speakers are adequate for listening to songs, but could definitely be better (I have a set of bose speakers so I hook Alexa up to those and it sounds fantastic)  🔶Voice recognition is good if there is no other noise in the background, however if I am playing music sometimes I have to shout in order for Alexa to hear me. On occasion however, Alexa does have trouble understanding certain words that I say to her if she has never heard it before and certain words even if she has heard them before, sometimes she misinterprets them for something else. However, it seems she is getting better at understanding what I tell her once I use that command more often.    Overall, I am still very happy with the purchase of the echo dot and would definitely recommend it for the value that it brings to my daily life.    Oct 2016: This is my first Echo and I have to say it is one o the best valued purchased that I have made in my entire life.  I have been wanting to get an Echo for sometime now, but have been put off by the price of the original Amazon Echo. As soon as this affordable model came out I knew I had to get it and I had one unit on preorder. When I finally received this unit last Thursday, I was suprised at how compact in size it is. After plugging it in and setting it up, which took about 1-2 minutes I immediately fell in love with it.  The setup process was extremely straight forward and quick. I already had a bose campanion sets of speaks so I just used the AUX out cable to plug the echo into my speakers. However even without the use of an outside set of speakers, I thought the echo dot still sounded relatively decent even for playing music. Alexa was able to recognize pretty much everything that I asked her to do such as turning on the light, playing music, asking about the weather, the news etc. Even when I am outside the room, about 10 feet away from her she can easily hear my normal speaking voice. The only time that she has trouble hearing me is when I have her playing really loud music, which is to expected considering I would not be able to hear someone talking in a loud room. She also has the ability to learn your speech pattern and voice the more often you use her, so she can better recognize and understand what it is that you want her to do. I also love the set alarm feature on her, I can simply tell her to set an alarm for 10 minutes or set an alarm for 8 am the next day without having to go onto my phone in the middle of the night. Another awesome feature about her is definitely how she can control smart light bulbs. For someone that is lazy as I am when getting out of bed at night to turn off the light, it is such a blessing to be able to simply say &#34;Alexa turn off the light.&#34; Another neat feature about her is that lately I have been having insomnia due to a big state board examination coming up, so I have been using her to help me sleep by playing relaxing ambiance. At the moment, you also change her name from Alexa to either Echo or Amazon. I currently have her under Echo in my room and Alexa in the living room since sometimes when I am calling to Alexa, the echo in the living room would pick it up as well. After getting my 1st unit, I ended up getting the 5 for 6 echo deal as I wanted another one in my living room as well and I also wanted to give some away as gifts to my family and friends. For $250 for 6 units, plus 5% cash back from discover credit card and the $5 gift card balance after reloading $100, each unit ended up costing me $38.75 which is just awesome value for all of the features that she can provide.

I also wish Amazon Prime came with more kid friendly stations; or a filter for explicit music.

william,"October 26, 2016 ",5.0,"NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.    Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.    Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it. ",
"iutaro girotto","April 10, 2017 ",5.0,"The Alexa dot is a godsend, i kept waiting for a black Friday discount since its release to get an echo, for 50$ this device is a steal, BUT, there is not much the device can do by itself, I use Alexa mostly for home automation, so I got a hue white kit(big mistake) and a blumoo(small mistake), the Phillips hue works GREAT! but only as long as you use hue bulbs, if you want third party bulbs STAY AWAY from Phillips hue!, the HUE whites are actually yellow, I dislike that color and that makes the room look old if you can understand what I mean, so I got the cree white 5000k, they are nice and white,so go for a wink or a Samsung smart things, they work way better, now to clarify you CAN add third party bulbs on hue from time to time but is really hard, and every other update they mess it up and it wont detect them again.    The blumoo only works for apple and not android so I had to borrow an old iPhone 4 that i have to keep always on in the house to make it work, wich bothers me to no end, but once you get it to work is awesome, turning on the AC, TV and Home theater 6 with a single voice command makes you feel like captain of a spaceship, if you can't get an IOS device with at least IOS7 i suggest you get anymote home, since its interface is better anyway.    the speaker is perfect for a bedroom, is just loud enough, is safe to say the echo is the best alarm clock on planet earth, I just say to Alexa at what time I want to be awake the next day and done, if you are a prime member it also comes with prime music which granted, doesn't have as many songs as Spotify is good enough, it can work with pandora and spotify as well if you are a member of those services, it's great for playing music, you can just ask her to play genre, author or specific song and thats it ",

Speech recognition is very powerful and quite accurate, especially compared to the technology just a few ars back.  The sound is also very adequate for such a small device but the well programmed bluetooth feature connects automatically to my soundbar when it is turned on.

This provides a very inexpensive way of starting out with an AI in one's home.  I would surely purchase this item again.  I have also purchased recently the Google Home AI and surely they are different items aimed at satisfying the user needs in different ways.  The one thing I can say about the Google Home so far is that the speaker sucks.  The full Echo has much better sound quality.

I waffled between this and the Echo, but decided to start with the small one and some existing computer speakers; we'll probably upgrade to better speakers eventually, but for now, it works really well.

Alexa has not misunderstood me one time yet. That in itself is amazing to me. I'm not a power user by any means, for me it's a 50 dollar device that I use to listen to music, set my alarms, get weather info and news, etc. Control a couple lights in the house as well. I'd pay the 50 bucks just for the music aspect. &#34;Alexa, Play James Taylor&#34; and I instantly get a variety of his music. I was hooked right there.

This means there is an automatic monthly payment to them.  I was signed up for something I did not want, and then I had to look around for how to cancel it in order to not have recurring charges.  The question &#34;do you want Amazon Music Unlimited&#34; is the equivalent of a lie when one becomes enrolled by answering NO.  Marketing really means manipulating, and Amazon is a giant - globally - for this.  As always - for any product by any company - buyer beware of any way a corporation can screw you.

310EI,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"We bought an Echo Dot as an early Christmas gift to ourselves and we're so glad that we did.  It's a very useful gadget because there's such a wide variety of things we can ask Alexa to answer or tasks that she can do for us (eg: alarms/timers, calendar, ordering, weather).    Since one of the tasks that we wanted Alexa to do for us was play music, we subscribed to Amazon's Unlimited Music Plan for the Echo Dot.  It's well worth the low monthly fee to be able to ask Alexa to play any song or album anytime, without having to buy all of them individually.    ​Millions of songs are available through one groovy gadget (and the Unlimited Music Plan).    We have the Echo Dot in our home and listen to music without any external speakers.  As far as we're concerned, the internal speaker emits a decent array of sound.  Is it as robust sounding as hooking it up to our surround system amplifier or other external speakers?  Of course not, but it does sound a lot better than most internal device speakers of similar size.  For those of you that don't like the internal speaker, you can utilize the 3.5mm or Bluetooth speaker options.    If we say, “Alexa, Play The Top Songs by Phil Collins”... then that's exactly what she does.    Keep in mind that when you ask Alexa for the &#34;Top Songs&#34; by a soloist or group, they may not always be your favorite songs.  A work around for that is to ask Alexa to play a particular album that contains the songs you prefer to hear.    The screen-shots show you how we asked Alexa to play an album vs the top songs. In addition, they show you what we see when logged-in to the Alexa app via the Chrome web browser.    FYI:  When asking Alexa to play an album that has a long title, we realized that she responds accurately when we ask for part of that title (view Elton John & Michael Jackson screen-shots).  Be sure to look at what we said to Alexa vs what the whole album title is labeled.    I should mention that we did ask Alexa to search for a product, which she did along with telling us the best options and their cost.  Afterward, she asked if we wanted to buy the product.  We said yes and she placed the order for us once we gave her our confirmation code (Settings: Voice Purchasing).  We recommend setting that up so other people cannot place orders without your consent.  It's convenient for us to have voice purchasing enabled when we're &#34;unplugged&#34; at night (except for Alexa).    The skill that we use the most is Weather Sky, it gives us a detailed weather report that we use several times each day.    ​At the time of this review, we haven't used any of the smart home features, but we didn't buy it for that purpose.    PLEASE NOTE:  We purchased the Echo Dot at its listed price, we did not receive any discount to post this review. ",
"Katy B.","March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"My first echo dot my mom gave me for my birthday and I set it up, it worked for a day and lit up but did not do anything the second day.  I have never dealt with Amazon customer support before and it was not an easy process.  You get the first layer who asks standard questions and if they can't solve it you go to the second layer in which you explain everything all over again.  The reps were nice enough, sometimes hard to understand their English, but I do believe they were trying to be helpful.  My biggest issue is how many customer service people I have talked to in order to get my dot working.  Amazon shipped me another new dot and I set it up.  It answered questions, but did not play songs.  What are the chances of getting two defective dots and they had different issues.  I had to call again and get two layers of representatives, explaining all of it over again.  This was hours on the phone and even though the rep tried hard to help, he had to finally give up and send the issue to the engineers.  Then, because I had two dots, I did not get my free 30 day unlimited music trial.  I was charged immediately so I had to call customer service again!  Two more reps to get that straightened out.  It has been a little over a week and I think I finally have it working properly.  After explaining the issues so many times I was ready to tell Amazon to take it back, it is not that great of a device for all this hassle. ",
Edgar,"January 10, 2017 ",5.0,"Better buy than the Echo tower from my perspective.  Very compact, can hide behind a lamp base, easy link to Bose mini speakers, love asking for various music to be played commercial free, very happy with it.  The instructions say a minimum of 3' from a speaker and you definitely want to have sufficient space between so it does not get confused with the sound and your voice.  iPhone App works very well for setup and changing any options.  Nice job Amazon!! ",
Leedoh,"March 3, 2017 ",2.0,"Very easy to use and setup to work with other items in the house.  Within 10-minutes of turning it on I had it working with our Nest Home thermostat and Lutron Caseta lights.  Once I get our AVR setup I will also sync it with the Harmony remote to be able to control the TV/AVR through the Dot.    The kids love it from asking various questions to using the timer for study activities.  It also helps to speak more clearly.    We are exploring other skills like lists to be able to further use it.    One thing that we wished it had was the ability to sync to iCalendar as it only looks like it supports Outlook and google calendar.  I would guess though that it is probably only a matter of time before that skill is there. ",
"Cynthia J. Salim","March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"DOT can be frustrating but I do enjoy the convenience when it works. I have two DOTS and a speakers connected to each DOT. Each DOT is used on a different floor of my home. The DOT in my bedroom is connected to a speaker by WIFI also connected to that DOT is a smart plug that controls a lamp. The DOT in my living area is connected using a cable to a speaker. I intend to have smart thermostats installed and connected too. I enjoy the music selection available using DOT. And,  I enjoy the convenience of weather reports, news, time, alarms, etc.    My beef is that sometimes DOT does not work using the voice mode. I can usually get what I want by going into my ALEXA APP and making a manual request. This happens most often at night when I want to have my lamp turned off or my music turned on. I am not sure why this happens. Generally, in the morning when I try the same request that failed at night, it works. When these failures occur, I check to make sure WiFi is working and it always is. ALEXA also lights up indicating that she hears me but does not execute the request. I am starting to wonder if I have made a mistake by buying the expensive Smart thermostats.    If anyone has any tips on how to get DOT to be more consistent, please share. ",

"Adam Jerome White","April 8, 2017 ",1.0,"If I were to rate this on its potential alone, I would rate it 5 stars.  But there just isn't the functionality now for it to be useful for 5 stars.  It has some really cool features, and I am sure in the future it will have more.  At that point I will come back and adjust my rating to make it a better rating.    For now I will tell you what I can do with it.  One cool feature is just playing music, I have it hooked up to an AMP, and into speakers in my ceiling.  I say &#34;Alexa play XXXX&#34; and the music starts.  It pretty much plays whatever I ask for, I guess it is included in a prime membership, because I am not paying for any additional service.  I have a Wink Hub 2 and Wink Relay, so I can turn on and off lights in the house, including the fireplace, with Alexa.

The setup was so easy I could not believe I was able to use it almost immediately.  You do have to tweak the system a little by going to the app and selecting setup.  Advice!  Put your location in it to include street address, as well as city and state.  Otherwise, if you ask it for weather or traffic conditions, it will give you Tucson, Arizona, which I believe is the default location.  At least on mine it was.  Not only a nice source for music but also a nice toy to play with.  Oh, one other thing!  You will want to get a speaker since the built in speaker has little or no bass. ",

I now have an Echo in the main living area, a Dot in the bedroom, and a Dot in my craft room.  The others were great Christmas gifts.  The Dot works identical to the Echo except it has a much smaller speaker.  It can be connected to a blue tooth speaker, or in the case of my craft room, I have an expansive set of Bose speakers and CD player/changer (I guess it is getting a little old).  I have the Dot plugged into the Bose speakers and the sound is great. The Dot is much smaller than the Echo so in many circumstances it would be preferred over the Echo as it doesn't take up much space.  We love our Alexa(s) ",

You have to remember just what to ask for - not as simple as clicking a song or album icon on a screen - since it doesn't tell you what's available.  It also plays back Audible books fine, provided you remember the title well enough (it won't list your Audible or Kindle libraries). The one we got cannot find our Kindle library, although we have lots of tts-eligible books in it, according to the Alexa app. I'm now finding out how many calls to Amazon and time on the phone it will take to get this fixed.

Within an hour I had the Dot installed and the app installed and Dot connected and playing my Amazon Prime Music (I think I will upgrade to the Unlimited for the Dot, since there were songs that were that far off the beaten path that Prime Music could/would not play). Also it took me 10 minutes to install the Harmony skills for Alexa and I was operating my Harmony Hub connected equipment. I am working on getting Alexa integrated with my Homeseer HS3 soon.  I will say it is worth the time to do the voice recognition set up.  It has its limitations,  but adds convenience.  I am sure the skills and functionality will improve as time goes on. ",

I also got a very short USB cord so I don't have a long cord tangled up on the counter.  This set up works great.    The Dot itself works really well in this context.  My bathroom is not big so I can hear music or news playing while I'm in the shower almost as well as when I'm at the sink.  My only note is that I wish it was slightly louder. I know it's a much smaller speaker than its larger cousin, but I've had other portable speakers about the same size that were louder. ",
"Allen F","March 21, 2017 ",5.0,"1. I have constant connectivity problems in which the Echo Dot, while it remains connected to the internet, somehow becomes invisible to my phone and tablet. Somehow this manages to mess up my Spotify account. It took a while, but I finally figured out that I could fix this by doing a complete reset on the Echo Dot. Now, I get to do that about once a day.  2. Speech recognition lags far behind Google and even Apple. Blows my karma on a regular basis by playing heavy metal when I asked for Rachmaninov's Vocalise. Pitiful.  3. There are thousands of so-called &#34;skills&#34;, or 3rd-party apps. They are uniformly useless. Do you really want a machine that tells you jokes? ",

Alexa frequently appears to crash. Probably too many people using. Trying to get nearest restaurant bar etc is totally inaccurate. Locations are miles further away. No way to custumize TuneIn so frequently get wrong status. Does not get logic right unless you use exact wording. I have two and both drop the Bluetooth connection occasionally.

Chromosome,"April 11, 2017 ",2.0,"In Sep 2106 I bought a second generation Echo to set up at work. I was never able to get it to work for longer than a couple of days. I think it has trouble connecting to WIFI networks that have a web page verification. We are talking about a university network that works well for everything else. It connected, but it would fall of the network. Finally, I gave up and I took it home in Marcy 2017, thinking that I would set up it there. Took a while. I was pretty disappointment until I realized that the Alexa server was down. While I was figuring this out, I looked into the warranty.  Have you tried to visit the Amazon warranty page? You should: https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201014520. Note the fine print that says &#34;..contact Customer Service using the contact information on the left side of this page&#34;. Now try looking left. There is no address (see photo). Well, one may say. It must be a mistake. Sure, but how to fix it? It took a long time (ok, maybe I am thick, but it was not obvious) to find phone support. End of the story, it is now working. It has nice features. Is it a miracle of technology? Not yet. ",
"The Bon","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"We had an Echo and thought it was all we needed. We put it in our livingroom (by the kitchen) and I pick random songs to play during the day, but also ask questions whenever I'm watching a movie on TV or listening to a song and wonder if a star or singer is still alive (ask Alexa - Which is the Echo's name).  I put things on my 'shopping list and it goes on my phone automatically (and on my husband's phone too, since we both have the Alexa app on our phones.). Recipes, measurements, and facts about whatever. But it's nowhere near our bedroom, so I ordered an Echo Dot as an 'extension'.  I can't believe we lived without this little, inexpensive, companion. It's on my nightstand and acts as our alarm clock, news station, weather station, and music source that has EVERY KIND OF MUSIC you could possibly want, just for the asking.  We are so blessed to be living in a time where we can have these Amazon innovations at our fingertips. The Echo and Alexa both have replaced our clocks, encyclopedia, dictionary, stereo, cd's, etc. we ordered ours through the &#34;LOVE MY ECHO&#34; website where we also get all information on both. Thank you, Amazon, for a website like this one. ",
LTCJDC,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"After three months of use, I don't like the Echo Dot or Alexa's attitude. It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't allow you to return an item after 30 days. I'd be returning it if they did. Common language isn't as successful as when verbally searching Google. Alexa can't find things without exact phrasing. I argue with her everyday because she doesn't understand me, doesn't have the answer or would like to sign me up for some Amazon product or service. She apologizes a lot. It is very frustrating and forces you to use the Alexa App to find what you need. The App is pretty good to find and control what you want the Dot to do.  Alexa can't always find things on iHeart radio or Tunein even though you listened to it 10 minutes before. She will sign you up for Amazon Music in a heartbeat. She does understand what &#34;worthless&#34; means and it quick to take offense. The Skills aren't very helpful and are mostly silly snippets that seem to have been written by young kids. Buy Google Home instead. You won't regret it. ",
"VJ in LA","April 6, 2017 ",5.0,"If you're just going to use the Dot for podcasts, internet radio, news briefings, weather, home controls, etc., the included speaker in this little unit is fine.  If you listen to a lot of music, the Dot is really intended to use through an external speaker or audio system, via either a male-male headphone cable (not included) or Bluetooth.    One great use for these is to turn an old clock radio that has an audio-in jack into a voice enabled internet radio and alarm.  I actually think Amazon would do well to release an Echo clock radio, but meanwhile retrofitting one with a Dot also works.  I converted two Logitech internet radios this way, and a standard stereo Sony clock radio.  This match up uses the superior speaker and clock display of the radios, but brings voice capabilities and internet radio/podcasts to your old device, not to mention everything else Alexa can do. ",
Kori,"April 10, 2017 ",2.0,"I enjoy my Echo Dot and use it every day. I bought three Echo Dots for three different rooms in my home. I use it mostly for weather, wake up alarm, dates, and cooking timer functions. Occasionally I use if to get some information of some famous actor or singer. I don't use it for music, instead I use my computer for music selection. The thing I like most about my Echo Dot is I don't have to remember and repeat the 'exact' command as suggested in the directions. Echo Dot seems to understand a question or command no matter how I phrase the sentence. The one thing it can't do that I want is to carry on a conversation like the AI in the movie 'HER'. I bought my Echo Dot with the expectation that it will be constantly updated and get smarter over the years ahead. I want it to 'understand' what I am asking it to do, and ask follow up questions. I am also watching Google's 'Home' to see if,in the future, it's AI can carry on a conversation. At the present the Echo Dot's AI is better than Google's 'Home' AI. One big advantage Echo Dot has over Google's 'Home' is that it's connected to your Amazon orders. You can order merchandise with Echo Dot and check on delivery date schedule.    When I first got my Echo Dot I played with it by asking it all sorts of questions, but as with any new gadget the new wore off and now I just use it like any appliance. I don't look at it or raise my voice or talk like a robot when using it. I just talk in a normal voice and never stop what I happen to be doing at the time. And I never think about the proper 'phrase' to use. I just say the sentence and let Echo Dot figure out the question or command. It's not perfect yet, but it's getting better. It seems to understand me 9 times out of 10 if I don't move too far from 'key words' to help Echo Dot focus on the command or question. ",

The Dot does not have a great sound like the echo. If you are using it for music, I suggest getting a speaker. I do wish we could pick our own name. You have Echo, Alexa, or Amazon.  I use it mainly for the weather, find out what movies are playing, a wake up call, and music. It is fun to use. I am sure they will come out with an even better one in the future.

"Mike W.","March 18, 2017 ",4.0,"The Amazon Echo Dot is the perfect product for tech fans that want to be on the cutting edge. This Dot does what other voice recognition devices cannot. Attached to phone apps, Alexa can do it all: she can play your favorite music, tell you about the weather, order you a pizza from your usual place, and change the thermostat, all while counting down the time until your cupcakes are ready. The beautifully designed device is easy to use and utilizes ever adapting technology that improves each time it is used.    Usability:  Amazon has built an app to accompany the Echo Dot which helps you learn your way around this device. With an extensive user guide, this app, although sometimes clunky, can lead you through tutorials in order to troubleshoot, install new information or tips to better use Alexa in your day-to-day life. The fact that the Dot is handsfree make the entire device worth it. You could be cooking in the kitchen and want to know a substitute for butter or how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon and not have to dirty your phone or computer when going to check. My favorite feature on the device is the timer setting. Although it seems insignificant, I never take it for granted when I can set a timer while not having to leave a pot on the stove.    Technology:  The technology used in the Amazon Echo Dot is amazing. The “mind” of Alexa is always growing. The more that you use the device the more Alexa understands you and your patterns of speech. The Dot uses six speakers in a concentric circle, and one in the center of the top of the device to pick up speech from anywhere in the room. Unlike Siri, who hears up the word “seriously” as the beginning of a voice command, Alexa is very good about only responding if her name is spoken. Not worry if you have already named you child Alexa and still want to be able to use the Echo Dot, the voice command can be switched in the app settings. The device has several light up features that are used in sequence. When Alexa hears you speak to her, she lights up to show the direction of sound and when she “thinks” about it the ring spins and blinks until she finds the answer.    Design:  The Dot is a minimalist’s dream! The sleek cylinder has a modern feel, and being the smaller version of the Amazon Echo it is the perfect device for a smaller place or a short shelf. The compactness of this device allows it to become inconspicuous in order to not interrupt the interior of the room it is in. The design includes four buttons on the top of the Dot. The buttons use very intuitive icons rather than words, however if the icons are not familiar there would be a bit of a learning curve involved. The Echo Dot is the perfect addition to a tech fan’s home!    I would recommend the Amazon Echo Dot to the technology user who is looking for a wonderful upgrade to the previously available voice recognition technology. The ease of usability of this beautifully designed technological marvel would fit in even the tiniest of homes! ",

Tortionist,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This little gem is worth every penny. I researched this device and watched a lot of YouTube videos on it before I decided to buy it. The set up is easy and it has pretty decent sound for such a small device. After all the research, I came to the conclusion that the only difference between this and the regular sized echo is the sound quality. The regular Amazon Echo gets better and louder sound. I look forward to purchasing it soon. My kids and I have had fun with it telling jokes. I would say that about 75% of the jokes are actually pretty funny and make me laugh. If you ask Alexa why she sucks she has a funny response in saying that maybe she thought she was a vacuum cleaner. We use it for Music, mainly Pandora, weather, jokes, etc. I'm getting ready to dig deeper and see what else is possible. ",
Dee,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I have had my Echo Dot for 5 months now. It is fun to ask it simple questions like what time is it, what is the weather forecast, tell her good morning or good night. But I am frustrated. I have it set up to turn on my living room light and it kept telling me it couldn't find it, I had to change it to something simple like &#34;light&#34; for her to understand. Today I asked her what day was the Boston Marathon going to be run this year. She couldn't find the answer in any of the 3 different ways I asked the same question. I went to my phone and did an OK Google, and found the answer on the first try. I also asked her today what is Patriot's Day. She couldn't find the answer. When asked the same way, OK Google found the answer on the first try. It is not unusual that she cannot find the answer but OK Google can.    The most useful thing I have found for her to do is play music (she is linked to a Bluetooth speaker), be a timer, and give me the weather forecast. I am frustrated. I read she is suppose to get smarter. So far she has not in my opinion. ",

Update 4/15/17:  Third party apps does not work seamless with the echo dot like the Kasa app for TP link, half of the the time Alexa cannot find the device.  It is nice just to speak from across the room to turn the lights on if the devices will work smoothly together.  I tried the Apple home kit with another brand smart plug for comparison, Apple app set up and the integration of the third party app has less steps and they work well together. ",
"Alfredo Jahn","April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"Only been using it for a few hours. Love it so far. I got it primarily to control my TP-Link wi-fi smart plug for my living room lamp. The only issue I'm having is, I can't hear Alexa when I plug it into my home stereo. The music sounds ok (seems a little out of phase, maybe it has to do with the streaming from Amazon Prime). So if I connect to my receiver to listen to music, then ask Alexa what the weather is, I can hardly hear her response. I tried to set it back to use the internal speaker, but couldn't figure out how to do that. I ended up unplugging it from the stereo, and now i can hear it from the internal speaker. But the music isn't really worth listening to from the tiny speaker. I hope I can resolve this issue. But for home automation and asking simple questions, it is fantastic! ",

Google Home, running on Google (obviously), is so much more robust and functional than Alexa, that runs on Bing (who uses Bing??). Google can answer so many more questions, making it so much more functional/usable.

Being able to control different elements of the home with the aide of voice control provides a high level of efficiency and convenience.  Everything from controlling the upstairs and downstairs thermostats, to turning on lights in other rooms, controlling your garage door from inside the home, setting timers, even adding to your digital calendar, when you are busy or have your hands full, the Echo-Dot will assist you along the way...

"Meghan Blake","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"It's a cool concept for the product but the majority of the time it says it doesn't understand what i am asking even when it is a simple question. If you open the app on your phone it tells you what you asked recently so it is easy to see what work she got mixed up on. Most of the time I can't believe it didnt understand a simple word and confused it for something else. Or if it didnt mix up words it still doesnt know the answer to the question. I really wanted this to be a great product as i got it for a gift for my dad but more often than not he ends up asking Siri his question and gets an aswer after Alexa &#34;is not sure what you are asking.&#34; ",

They enable new skills, like apps, all the time. I like Magic 8 Ball. Ask her if Trump will last four years. Anyway, well worth her small investment. ",

I have also used Prime Now to order groceries through the echo all while still attending to my little one.  I love that I can ask Alexa to play music for babies that we can sing to as well.  Alexa provides hours of entertainment! ",
Middlebunny,"March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"I've been an avid Amazon customer since they started.  I have 2 kindles and was relatively satisfied.  I read all the rave reviews for the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.  They seemed legitimate; however, I guess those reviewers either had low expectations or were incentivized to express those favorable opinions.  After going on an Echo Dot, Tap and Echo purchasing frenzy, I now have a total of 3 Dots,1 Tap and 1 Echo and am suffering buyers remorse.    If you need or want to know the local weather or get  flash news updates on command, the Echo or Echo Dot are your devices.  I, on the other hand, use them for music streaming.  I find that the &#34;sleep function&#34; has flaws, voice recognition/comprehension needs great improvement and everyone should know that it is really unnecessary to buy more of these devices unless you have multiple amazon music accounts such that you can stream on those separate accounts from different locations/rooms.  Otherwise, users should know that the devices cannot be linked together for simultaneous streaming.  They also cannot be used by different parties to stream different music from each different device.  Apparently, Amazon Prime Music only allows streaming to one device at a time.    The Tap cannot be used for streaming unless a wireless connection is available.  I wouldn't recommend connecting via an unsecured connection so unless you have a secure, mobile wireless connection, the Echo Tap is nothing more than an expensive, portable bluetooth speaker which you can purchase for much less than the cost of an Echo Tap.    One might notice that the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap are often paired with supplemental bluetooth speakers with 2-3 item purchase combination discounts.  This is a very misleading promotion as it leads one to believe they can be used for simultaneous streaming.  That is not the case at all.  Unfortunately, the E-Dot only has a one-way BT connection.  Either you play music from the E-Dot or the BT speaker; but, you cannot play music from both.    There are a lot of Applications for Alexa, the voice operated system used to operate the E-Dot and Echo.  Unfortunately, a lot of them have complicated wake phrases/statements.  If you don't phrase the statement exactly right, the app won't work and Alexa will not understand the command.  You can honestly spend more time trying to phrase things correctly to trigger Alexa then it might have taken for you to manually execute what you wanted to do like creating a shopping list, or recording water consumption.    Another shortcoming with Alexa is the slow re-fresh rate of the application.  Sometimes, you have to completely exit out of it, stop it from running in the background on your phone and then reload it in order to get it to reflect your most recent commands or current &#34;now playing&#34;.  In addition, there are other limitations specific to music streaming.  Let's say you want to stream a specific artist all day long to soothe a pet with separation anxiety.  If 1) you set the sleep timer for longer than you'll be away (ex. for 12 hours) and 2) Alexa confirms she will stop playing in 12 hours, that isn't exactly true.  Alexa will actually stop playing when she reaches the end of the artist's play queue which may only be 4 hours of music.  Theoretically, you can manually or verbally set Alexa to repeat the queue; however, I haven't tested this successfully yet.  It may only repeat the queue once rather than indefinitely until stopped by the sleep timer.    My final Alexa app gripe relates to the repeat function.  Unlike the iTunes or Amazon Music apps, Alexa cannot repeat one song in a queue.  You'd think that toggling the repeat button 2 times would trigger this function; however, all it seems to do is toggle the repeat option to the &#34;off&#34; position.    All in all, individually each product has its benefits so my rating is a low 3.  There is just no reason, other than needing a device in a location outside of the primary product's voice range, to purchase more than one device.  My thought is that the Echo-Dot is the most versatile of all 3 products; however, the Echo has better sound quality.  I have noticed the improved sound quality on the Echo; but, the improvement really doesn't make up for the price difference.  If I could do it all again, I'd invest in the Echo Dot for home and an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker for work that I can connect to the iTunes or Pandora applications on my phone.  That way, I will still be able to stream Amazon Prime music through the Dot at home for the stressed pet while playing comforting music in my office. ",
"Scott Dau","March 25, 2017 ",5.0,"I really like this product.  It was very easy to set up.  The voice recognition is very good.  She comes out of the box with built in features (skills) that get you going fast.  Adding new skills is very easy and ready to access immediately.  Although the database of new skills is still very small and frankly, pretty crappy, that's not Amazon's fault.  It's just like the App Store, it's up to the &#34;people&#34; to create skills for us to download.  I paired the Echo Dot with a Wemo Lightswitch and a Wemo Insight Plug.  I control the living room lights and my bedroom lights (from a lamp) via Alexa.  It's very convenient.  I plan to expand with more Echoes and more Wemos.  There's a few cool accessories to get for the Echo like the Amazon authored Zero touch care mount (to bring the functionality of Alexa on your phone into your car).  I highly support the Echo and recommend it to anyone.  I even purchased one to a friend for his birthday. ",
"Old Radio Guy","December 22, 2016 ",3.0,"Fun for entertainment, but nothing more. Timer and alarm functions require an Internet connection, so if it loses connection and you had an important alarm or timer set, forget it. I have 240 mbps Internet with an Arris 1682g dual-band (AC standard) wireless router, 15 feet from Alexa. When we ask her a question sometimes an orange light appears and she says &#34;Sorry, there's no Internet connect&#34;, even though the app says she's connected. Today I asked her to set a 10-minute timer. When the timer went off, she wouldn't cancel it. When I asked her if she knew what &#34;stop&#34; meant, she gave me 4 definitions of stop. I had to unplug her for 15 seconds to cancel the alarm. With such spotty performance, I see a Warranty return sometime in her near future. ",

Sound quality, in my opinion, is not slightly less than the Echo, it is a lot less than the echo.  Max volume is lame.  The dot is good for small garage use for music.  That's about it.  Was thinking I'd go ahead and get an echo but I hear the Google one is pretty impressive so I am considering the options. ",

She loves the stories, jokes, and music --plus quite a few other skills.  I like for her to have it because it allows her to get these fun things without using her phone!  The phone has too many features -- even just simply turning on music may mean she spends time looking at stuff online, texting, or playing with apps.  I just wanted her to play music easily while cleaning her room or doing homework.  So nice for her to walk in her room ask Alexa for her schedule or to dos. ",
autumn,"March 26, 2017 ",2.0,"My kids like the echo dot.  It plays music, answers questions about the weather, and does addition/subtraction etc..

It also takes a little long for echo dot to answer questions.  I understand that it is impossible to answer all questions, but I expect echo dot will be able to answer a lot more than what it currently does.  At least, the programmers should collect the type of questions echo dot is not able to answer and then add more facts to their knowledge base.  Also, I am not sure why cannot echo dot parse information obtained through search engine (echo dot uses bing) to answer questions ",
"Mister Gizmo","April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I was just learning to live with my disappointment over an LG &#34;smart&#34; TV I'd bought recently that is anything but smart. In addition, it has the worst user interface I've seen since the 1980s. Fortunately, Amazon has brought out a device that works, works well, and is very intuitive. It was a little bit of a problem setting up, because the instructions are so limited, but once over that small hump, it's been fine. I'm surprised at how well it understands commands, even with so-far limited exposure to my voice to learn from.    If there's a frustration, it's mainly that the Dot (and Alexa devices in general) have a lot more potential than what's available right now. As with any new device, it takes a while for third parties to figure out what capabilities are possible, and then to spend the time and effort developing them. As just one example, I could see the Dot acting as an intercom, even a rudimentary telephone to connect Dot/Alexa users. I'm thinking particularly of elderly or handicapped people who'd like something that only requires voice commands. But I'm willing to wait. And since most of the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, the Dot's hardware should be good for a few years.    Now if Amazon would only invest a little more time to bring its Kindle browser, which has been in beta for years and years, into something that actually works. You can do it, Amazon! The Dot shows that you can be great at software if you really try. :-)    Update: I did experience one wrinkle when buying a Dot for a friend. It arrived pre-registered to me. Trying to use the normal setup for the new user didn't work. I finally realized that I had to de-register it from my account, sign out of the Alexa app (and reset the Dot), then sign in as a new registrant. This is explained in Alexa help, but it wasn't obvious at first. I don't know if it's the case, but if you buy it as a &#34;gift&#34; in the purchasing process, it &#34;may&#34; arrive unregistered, which would be good. I suspect Amazon ships them registered to streamline the setup by eliminating a couple of steps. ",
FrostEternal,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Cool device, not worth $50, I had a gift card for $20, it IS worth $30 plus tax.     Amazon needs to step up the game on Alexa - when it works, it works, but much dumber than other AI assistants like Siri or Cortana, and ZERO sense of humor or personality. The skills are cumbersome, music playing support only works well with Amazon music unless you are streaming to it as a bluetooth speaker - which is dumb, as the speaker is not loud enough to hear over an air conditioner.    The Alexa platform is VERY open - which is cool BUT it means the available &#34;Skills&#34; are mostly very poor quality. For some reason the white Dot still comes with a black power cord, which is just more lack of attention to detail on Amazon's part. Sloppy, sloppy.    This is a must-have if you use any home automation - although the setup is VERY CLUNKY - expect hours of set up to get it just right if you want to change light colors or do anything more complex than switching smart devices on or off. There's a terrible interface for adding and forgetting devices in the companion &#34;app&#34; -  I use the term &#34;app&#34; VERY loosely - it's more of a sloppy wrapper on a webpage. Integrating with iOS is spotty at best without lots of workarounds and IFFFT recipes - pretty much essential - and theres no way to program custom words or commands beyond meager smart home groups and Stringify/IFFFT services. Alarms, timers, schedules - all poorly implemented - no way to have Alexa automatically announce reminders or alarms, just one ring tone that is set for all alerts. Commands have very little context and must be given one at a time - no way to say &#34;Alexa, dim my main lights and turn on the kitchen lights&#34; - she will just complain that she doesn't understand, or just ignore the command entirely.  HOWEVER - despite all these drawbacks I think they will EVENTUALY be ironed out. It's still a cool addition to a geeky home setup and with lots and lots of customization (and maybe even scripting one's own skills) it can be more useful than annoying.  Seriously though, Amazon - hurry up. ",

"The Divine Ms. K","March 28, 2017 ",3.0,"UPDATE FEB 4, 2017:  If you have read my first review you know I had software problems with my Echo Dot. Well I emailed Amazon and a customer service rep called me right back!!!!!!! He was super nice and we went through I-don't-know-many trouble shooting scenarios. Although we couldn't get the issue resolved, he referred me to the next level of customer technical support. While waiting for a contact (I was told to wait several days) the problem resolved itself. When someone from Amazon contacted me with had an additional discussion and we both agreed the problem was related to a skill or skills I had installed the night the problem developed. Since I had already reset the app and I couldn't remember what I had added and in what order, there was nothing further to do. I was given a contact support link to use should the problem return.  You really don't know how good a company is until something goes wrong. Based on this experience with Amazon, I have even more confidence in the company. Thank you Amazon!  PS... my echo teachable moment. Add your skills one at a time and think about staying with apps which at least have several reviews.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I had It is I received this as a Christmas present. Initially I really liked it... it's novel, geeky, and entertaining  (ask Alexa to sing).  I was really hoping for something google like... &#34;What time does the post office open?&#34;and that kind of thing. Unfortunately, it doesn't really do that well yet. I'm sure that Alexa needs to learn and that will get better over time. Part of the problem is that it uses Bing over Chrome (you can't change the search engine). What it does well is play music from Amazon. Other cons: its ability to have more usefulness relies on &#34;skills&#34; which are loosely apps for Echo. The skills allow it to do things it can't do on its own (like tell you what happened on a certain day in history). Skills also allow it to interface with a few existing apps you may have on your phone (e.g. Our Groceries).  A lot of the skills are very limited in their usefulness (e.g. Cat facts). Echo needs verify specific phrasing to give you info or use a skill. In a review I read the reviewer said he felt like he needed flash cards in order to remember how to ask Alexa to do things and I agree/ For setup, and maximum functionality, you need the app on your phone. It turns out that the app doesn't work very well on Samsung Galaxy 6 or 7. In fact, for many (including me) it doesn't work at all. Mine worked long enough to allow me set up the Echo and get a few skills. Now it doesn't work at all. Obviously I haven't been able to connect it to any smart device (like lights). If that is what interests you make sure you do your research.  - requires more than you think and it's not cheap.    At the present this is a hockey puck that can tell me the weather. I haven't given up on it though. Some future update will allow the app to work on my phone, Alexa will get better at answering questions, more skills will be available and be less kludgey. ",
"Prasham Shah","March 4, 2017 ",4.0,"I've always been loyal to Amazon for almost 8 years now, and I absolutely love their creations. This has to be a bulls-eye for sure. It is really easy to setup and I got it up and running in just a few minutes. I have a fairly decent sized room and I have this placed in one corner and it hears me just fine. I am still learning all the functions but so far, definitely impressed. I was surprised this had a built in speaker (and loud for it's size) as well. Eliminates the need to have large speakers around the house.    4-Star review because no product can be perfect, but I'll come back in a few months and give an update on how it's fitting in.

It is so much more efficient then getting my phone, turning it on and typing the item on my list. I use the timer frequently when I am cooking.  As an Occupational therapist, I know this has many useful possibilities for those who have physical challenges.  I'm planning on purchasing one for my 90 year old Mother who has very limited vision.

Highboost145,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I ordered the Echo Dot after receiving Echo as a Christmas present.  Now that I have had time to look at all the functionalities, here is my input.  Hopefully the folks at Amazon Echo team will read this and make the following feature improvements.  1. Lack of equalizer (bass/mid/treble are all absent):  Echo line of speakers had 2 years of product maturity time.  I would imagine this equalizer function can be added with &#34;skills&#34; or software update.  2. &#34;Skills?!&#34;:  If you watch Google Home video, the device will literally Google everything for you.  Instead, for Echo devices, you have to add &#34;skills&#34; to enhance its functionality.  ....What???  I was hoping that devices like Echo will already come with all the common skills.  3. It can't Google: If you ask Alexa if she can Google things, she will tell you she can Bing things for you.  OK, so why can't she give me a meatloaf recipe, if she can connect to Bing?  And she can look up Wikipedia?  I don't really care for that.  Amazon, please make your own search engine, or fine-tune Bing search capability.  If this device can provide all the answers to our questions via Google or Bing, it would be a worthy competitor to Google Home.    Now that I got the negatives out of the way, I do think Echo still has the upperhand when it comes to connected home.  Recently, I purchased TP Link smart switch and connected my lamp.  Now with the verbal command, I can have Alexa turn on/off lights in my bedroom.  I also connected my Echo Dot to my home sound system by bluetooth.  My next connected home experience will be thermostat.  Overall, Echo is a product that is already matured, but there is still room for tons of improvements.  I really wish that the folks at Amazon will make those updates and make this product very competitive to Google Home. ",

"King Bolete","January 8, 2017 ",3.0,"The Echo Dot is awesome if you're looking to connect to a smart home. It's also pretty cool to use just as a handy voice assistant. ALEXA&#34; can be helpful and a lot of fun. It's easy to ask questions and her answers are clear. I'm still learning about the features and how to access them, but so far it's a breeze.    You can ask about the weather, the time, the latest news, set an alarm, set a timer, ask a question of Wikipedia, ask what song or singer is currently on, pause, play, stop, change volume, ask how to spell something, she tells jokes and plays 20 Questions or Jeopardy...the list goes on and on and it's all done just with your voice. At this price, the Dot seems to be well worth the investment and a lot of fun! ",
"Ken Feher","February 28, 2017 ",2.0,"The Echo Dot is a fun and convenient product for a reasonable price. You can ask Alexa for any information you would Google and you will get an answer. You can ask for music to be played and she will play the music as long as you have a subscription service. I became a Prime Member so that I could have access to the Amazon Music library. Alexa understands most anything you say. The speakers on this little device are excellent. I use it for setting alarms and timers to alert me when the dryer will shut off or its time to head out to an appointment etc. I use it to play music. I use it to tell me an occasional joke. It can keep you abreast of the business news, world news, etc. It has the capability to help you control household electronic devices.  It's a handy little device.  If you think some of these things might make your life easier or more enjoyable go for it. ",
Tylerrrr,"January 14, 2017 ",5.0,"I love this thing more and more as time goes on. Want to know what the weather is going to be ? Ask alexa. Basketball scores ? Ask alexa. I even hooked it up to my home automation devices (WeMo switches) so I can turn the lights on and off in my room with a simple voice command. It even lets you create groups so you can say &#34;turn off all lights&#34; or choose specific ones like &#34;turn off the living room lamp&#34;. For only $50 it's a steal. I wouldn't use it for playing music, but it does have aux out so you could connect a nice pair of bookshelf speakers if you don't have a nice speaker setup already. ",
"Tech Guy from IL","April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"This is really an amazing gadget and I'm finding a lot of good uses for mine. In the bedroom it is handy because you can ask Alexa the time or the weather at any time of the night without having to get out of bed or turn on a light. It also plays a wide variety of music. I use it to stream classical music from my favorite classical station. The sound is actually pretty good (in mono) right out of the disc if you are listening at low levels in a quiet room or at your desk at the office. Plug in a good pair of headphones and you'll get great sound in stereo. Sometimes I connect it to my stereo system and listen that way. With the dearth of good programming on local radio these days, having the ability to pick up stations from other areas on the Internet is really nice. This might be the best sounding and easiest to use Internet radio currently available, especially for the price. No complicated user interface to deal with. You just say &#34;Alexa, play (insert name of station) from Tune-In&#34; and you are set. ",
"S. Oake","April 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I don't review very often but felt compelled to do so with this item. I bought two of these the day they were released. One has worked flawlessly. Its twin, not so much and it has gotten progressively worse. It finally got to the point where the dot was done more than up so I called customer service. We went through the script, resetting everything and finally, the customer rep escalated my case. When I got the next level rep, my dot had started its working correctly cycle, so we disconnected. No sooner had we ended the call did the dot stop working again. Called back to customer service and the first rep decided to begin the reading of the script. I put a stop to that foolishness right away and told him to immediately escalate the case. The new rep determined that it was indeed a failing dot and then informed me that the dot 2nd generation only had a 3-month warranty and I would need to pay another $50 for a replacement (1st generation had a 1-year warranty). I had spent 1.5 hrs total this afternoon with customer support reps to find out that this device has one of the crappiest warranties in electronics! I hit the roof. I told them they either replace this piece of junk that has their name on it, or they cancel my prime membership. Their call. There was no third option. The new dot is in the mail, and a return label is sitting in my email waiting to be printed out.  The only reason this got a 2 star was the other dot I bought has worked flawlessly since day one. Anyways, I was considering one or two more dots for the place I live however I will not be doing so until Amazon corrects their 3-month warranty into a year long one. ",
"Navneet P. Singh","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Ok so I have had this since ED2 came out...It works awesome, except for yesterday, I came home and asked Alexa to turn on lights,and she never responded to me, I opened the Alexa app and saw that all the groups I had set up were gone...I have 20 Hue lights and a TP-Link smart plug. I went through and added them all again and recreated my groups...still nothing so I ended up resetting it, and still no luck, the remote did not work either, I did a factory reset and still same issue, I called Amazon Support at 12:43 AM EST (they closed at 10 pm PST) when I called them, I got a message saying that Alexa was not working right and got hung up on...I tried this morning and all was well ",
Chad,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"First off, you will need the speaker so buy it. I wanted to Y this off with an adapter and run both my computer and this through the same speakers, but that didn't work so I ended up buying speakers. The other issue I have is that the microphones don't seem to pick up quite as well as my Echo. Still great mind you, but I notice that several times I've had to speak up. But with Echo I don't get that.    The main flaw with Alexa continues to be its reliance on Bing as its search engine. Amazon really needs to either create its own search algorithm for Alexa, switch to Google, or at the very least allow customers (the ones that are always right) to pick which of the two they want. I've performed experiments where I've asked Alexa and not gotten an answer then used OK Google with the same keywords and gotten exactly what I wanted. A perfect example was last night. I asked when the polls closed in my state. I named the state. Alexa couldn't tell me but instead said to go to the link that it placed in my app...well...first off...that's no good because I'm asking Echo and not my phone. When I did grab my phone and asked OK Google the exact question it gave me the answer I was looking for without any issues. I'm tired of Alexa either not knowing or putting a link in the app. I can tell you now I've never, not one single time, looked at that link in the app because I don't have it with me. The entire idea of a voice activated friend in every room is to get answers whenever and wherever you want. I don't want to carry my phone around the house with me.    All that said, I still enjoy having this device. I own Echo, this echo dot, and another will arrive this afternoon (literally). So I'm not knocking the product entirely. It's massively expandable using IFTT and skills but it's core function, that of an assistant, lacks and will lack until they get better search. ",
"The Nurbler","March 7, 2017 ",4.0,"I have two of these, and the one feature I was most hoping for is described on this amazon help page https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202013740 like this:    &#34;Note: You cannot connect multiple Alexa devices to each other and play the same requested audio at the same time.&#34;    Since these things have speakers and can stream audio, it is only natural to wish that I could stream my Pandora (or other) music to all of the Echos I own at the same time, in sync.  I don't think it is the statement above that is upsetting in and of itself.  What is upsetting is that, based on that statement it appears that Amazon has no interest in even attempting to make this happen.  Why, oh why is that true? ",
Val_NYC,"November 9, 2016 ",4.0,"Good: This is the product we've been waiting for. All the internet knowledge at the tip of your fingers... just say &#34;Alexa!&#34;, she'll be there for you answering to an enormous amount of questions. Ordering stuff online, giving you the traffic info on your way to work or just the forecast, keeping your life organized.   Of course, it's hard to resist from purchasing additional components...it's so cool to be able to lay on the sofa, turn the lights on or off, operate any IR devices you might have, locking doors, closing the blinds, starting the coffee maker or controlling the temperature using your voice. It doesn't matter the light switch is next to your head or the stereo/ TV remote is right in your hand. It's the feeling that you step into a new world with huge further options to discover, it's the power to having such a powerful tool at your disposal.  And I know the developers are just warming up.

Justin,"November 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I must say this thing is pretty awesome, and fun! It does have its problems tho. At times it really does not understand me unless I stop and speak slow and close to it. It was having that problem for a solid 10mins yesterday, but after 10mins it was cool again. It seems to go haywire at times like that but not for long at all. And not that often.    I do have some problems staying connected when doing the voice training. For some reason the voice traing seems super messed up for me right now. You got thru 25 commands and for me pretty much every other command it would lose connection. Took almost 20mins to get thru the 25 commands.    It is awesome tho don't get me wrong here, i just wanted to point out it's flaws....And that is all of them :) Not too bad. and it is always improving and updating. This thing is awesome for playing my music, and pretty much just being my personal B****! :) The alarm is something I LOVE! I hate rolling out of bed and messing with my phone. Now I say &#34;Alexa STOP&#34; That's it :) The built in speaker is pretty good for a small apt. I love in a 1 bedroom apt. and it cranks. I still have it hooked up to my own speaker since its an awesome speaker I have. The built in speaker is more than enough tho for an alarm clock, timer, and music in a small apt. I also love being able to hear NFL scores so easy. &#34;Alexa, score of Denver game?&#34; Boom! It's a lot of fun.    There is a lot of stuff this thing can do. There is sooo many list of features out there that I am not going to go into that. This thing is great for someone who does a lot of multitasking. It has made my life a lot easier working from home. I would recommend it for the $50 price tag easy. It is a lot of fun to just mess around with as well. If you are looking at this and the $180 echo. There is no decision to be made. Go with this $50 echo, do not go for the Expensive one with a better speaker. You can get a better speaker way cheaper.    It does need some work, and they're doing a great job moving it along the track. I expect when the Google thing comes out it will push Amazon even more and in a years time this Echo Dot could be really, really epic for the price. ",
scummins89,"January 9, 2017 ",5.0,"This device is more or less a novelty period when asking questions Alexa cannot answer most things. It is difficult to get the device to work properly. I find using anything as far as a search text deep explanation and you have to be very specific to get the answers that you want. I would definitely not recommend this device until Amazon can come up with something better. I was highly disappointed and all levels. However the speaker was above average from what I could tell it surpassed my expectations. The design is also very nice I like the size and color. ",
"Janet Mac","October 24, 2016 ",4.0,"Thank you for making Alexis more affordable by offering the Dot as an option.  I haven't used it yet with a Bluetooth speaker, but I plan to.

Paired with the Phillips Hue light bulbs, and the TP-Link smart plug, I don't have to go down stairs to turn on or off lights.  I love the convenience.  I also use it to get movie times at my favorite theater without turning on my computer or my smart phone. ",
Danny,"April 9, 2017 ",2.0,"For the price (especially the black friday price of $40) this is a great deal. I still use my original echo that I got about a year ago at least a few times a week, and I just bought two dots to play music in the shower and set alarms in my bedroom.    Since I live in an apartment often more than one echo hears me, but it's been working seamlessly that only the one closest to me (or that I am speaking in the direction of) replies.    If anyone from Amazon reads this, the feature I REALLY WANT is to give fire tv commands to my echo, e.g. &#34;play Westworld in the living room&#34;, &#34;pause the show&#34;, etc. I'm really hoping they add this ability soon, as well as other device coordination features like playing the same song on multiple echoes in multiple rooms.    A couple of other notes that might be useful for people:    - I bought the white echo Dot, but the usb cord and usb outlet adapter are black. Feels like Amazon got lazy here, why can't you make those in white too? I took away a star for this combined with the fact that it doesn't interface with the Fire TV at all.    - the speaker is good, for music it's honestly barely noticeable that it's a little worse in the lower-mid ranges than the regular echo. Where I actually notice it more is in Alexa's voice, it's just not quite as full sounding as the regular echo's voice. I was surprised that this is what stood out to me, but it almost sounds like a different person which was strange the first few times I used it.    - The volume on the dot is also good, at max volume it's probably about the same as the original echo at 8, which is higher than I ever set it.    - the usb outlet adapter is about 2 inches deep, which is bigger than I've seen in other electronic products. About twice as deep as the iphone usb wall adapter, I assume it's drawing more current and they aren't compatible but I haven't checked. On the upside, it's a standard 2-prong size, so it can plug into one of the middle spaces in a power strip and only take up one space. I guess they optimized for power strip usage instead of being able to plug it in behind furniture up against the wall. ",
"Bev Martin","December 12, 2016 ",5.0,"I purchased several of these on prime day when you could buy 4 (or was it 5) and get one free.  I now have an Echo in the main living area, a Dot in the bedroom, and a Dot in my craft room.  The others were great Christmas gifts.  The Dot works identical to the Echo except it has a much smaller speaker.  It can be connected to a blue tooth speaker, or in the case of my craft room, I have an expansive set of Bose speakers and CD player/changer (I guess it is getting a little old).  I have the Dot plugged into the Bose speakers and the sound is great.

"G. Stapleton","November 3, 2016 ",5.0,"I use this anytime I am in the kitchen for a long period of time. My other main echo is in my bedroom. The key to this type of technology is to just use it. It's easy for one not to find a need for a product like this. Mainly because they have it on their phone, which they don't use either. I use mine for any and everything. I ask the weather before I leave work, I am constantly asking fo the time, I listen to my Spotify through it and the list goes on. I even download extra things that the echo offers through the website to add even more complexity to it.    So, buy it and use it. ",
DTG3,"December 19, 2016 ",2.0,"Had an echo, and used it in my bedroom for ambiance and as an alarm clock and for audiobooks occasionally.  I didn't like moving it back and forth from the living room when I had guests over (where it gets a lot of use and attention), so I purchased this so I wouldn't have to move it and so that I wouldn't have to give up on an alarm clock in the bedroom.    So now my echo dot sits by the bed.  I don't have the same bass that I have with the full-sized echo, but that's alright. This thing does what it does well and is great for audiobooks and ambient music, but would probably fall short if you're a big audiophile. For the cost of a mid-high range alarm clock, I've got that functionality and an assistant to tell me the weather and play music while I'm getting out of bed in the morning, and I still have my echo in the living room for parties, music while we cook/play board games, and what else have you.

"Amazon Customer","January 21, 2017 ",5.0,"I like the Echo Dot.  I already had a Bose speaker to hook it up to so I didn't need the full Echo.  It is useful to ask questions about the weather or to turn on our hue lights and other lights hooked up to our WeMo plugs.  I only give it 4 stars because Amazon needs to improve the number of &#34;skills&#34; it has and to partner with more home automation companies like Sonos.  Its ability to interact with Nest and our separate Honeywell Wifi thermostat are limited at best.  Also the AI could use some tweaking... like this morning I kept asking about how windy it was going to be or what the projected wind speed would for the day (it was supposed to be very windy) and Alexa kept just telling me the forecast over and over.  Obviously she understands I am asking about the weather (&#34;wind&#34; apparently = &#34;weather&#34; to her) but does not understand that I am asking particular information.  Other times she will directly respond like when I asked specifically if there was any snow in the forecast.  If she can't answer it that's fine, but she should say so instead of just repeating the same answer.    Again, its a work in progress and I am sure it will get better as time does on.  I would recommend you do your research and figure out the home automation products that appear to work best with Alexa/Echo before you pull the trigger. ",
Shawna,"April 4, 2017 ",5.0,"Its alright. She does some cool things and once you get her app and choose what you want her to know and do voice recognition she works a lot better. Still there's times she don't understand simple things and other times she don't hear you say something that you said very clear. And a rare moment where she will ramble about odd things that have nothing to do with what you are talking about. She went on a rant about worms and angels.... But... We laugh so... Oh well lol ",

You might as well use the speaker on your device because it has more volume than the echo does. I wanted to return it but I waited to long to decide if I liked it or not.

Also, consider buying a battery so that the device can become portable (as long as you're connected to with-fi).

"David Ashley","March 27, 2017 ",3.0,"I ordered four of these as gifts, at about $40 each (on sale).  At the time I ordered, I already owned two Amazon Echos.    These have most of the significant functionality of the Amazon Echo, but at a far lower price.  Functionality included:  WiFi, 7 microphones with very good voice recognition, LED ring with many segments (a pretty good light show), speaker.  Functionality not included:  won't function as a Bluetooth speaker, does not have volume adjustment ring (has buttons instead).    I was very pleased.  Out of a slightly-larger-than-a-hockey-puck-sized device, I expected terrible sound.  But the sound is completely adequate, both in volume and quality.  It is perfectly adequate for listening to music in your kitchen or listening to audiobooks in your bedroom.  It is louder and clearer than I expected (but of course not as good as the Echo).  And of course since it has audio output (AUX plus Bluetooth), you can really crank up the volume with the right secondary device.    Amazing functionality at that price point.  Amazing sound from something roughly the size of a hockey puck.    This device is five stars, especially at the $40 or $50 price point. ",
Jeff,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"LOOOOOOOVE my Dots! I'm really getting used to talking to Alexa, getting helpful information, turning off and on music, lights, etc.    I have two desires in order to get to 5 stars:    1) Alexa confuses profiles if two Amazon Household members each have separate Amazon Prime accounts. My wife and I have separate Amazon accounts. However, when registered in Alexa as a household, she can't tell one calendar from another. This makes no sense to me, since each registered email address has its own GMail calendar, but according to Amazon Support, Alexa can't distinguish them if we have separate Amazon accounts. The result is she can only read from one calendar, regardless of which profile she's set to. It's a minor annoyance, but makes the calendar connection useless unless we close one of our Amazon accounts.    2) Alexa has a bit of trouble distinguishing Smart Home routines. For example, if you have 2 Smart Home routines called &#34;Enter Bedroom&#34; and &#34;Leave Bedroom&#34;, she always has to ask which one you really want, even though &#34;Enter&#34; and &#34;Leave&#34; sound nothing alike.

The only thing that didn't interest me was the price, $180 for a large microphone array and a speaker. Sure, the Amazon integration and the music playback sounded interesting, but no where near $180 interesting.    Then the Echo Dot was announced. This was an interesting offer. A smaller version of the Echo with a smaller speaker to accompany it. The only issue was the price. $80 was much, much better than the $180 for the original Echo, and the Alexa platform was coming along nicely to an outsider, with more applications being supported with it. But $80 was too much for the first generation dot.    And finally the Echo Dot generation 2 was announced. At the $50 price point I was enamored with it. Cheap, without compromising the impressive microphone array and Alexa voice recognition. This would be the perfect device for home automation and music playback. And the Dot excels at those. The cheaper Echo exclusive Amazon Music service was a great offering and it makes the Dot such a better device. The home automation integration is extremely pleasing to use. Alexa's voice recognition is far, far superior to other voice assistants such as Siri and Google Now. Alarms are easy to set and go off when they should.    I look forward to next generation Echo devices and services and feature to come to the Alexa platform ",
"Parker Brissette","January 9, 2017 ",4.0,"My wife and I were in a shouting match this morning with Alexa. &#34;Alexa, Turn the bedroom lights on&#34; my wife shouted. &#34;Noooo,&#34; I cried out. Although, similar to Alex Trebek, Alexa only accepts your command if it is preceded with her name. To my dismay the lights came on in a blinding fury that severely disturbed my sleep. The moment my wife left the room I spoke softly, &#34;Alexa, turn off the bedroom lights.&#34; At last, the soothing sight of my eyelids was undisturbed by the ominous glow of an earlier riser. But the story does not end there.    Not but two minutes later I was reminded of Springsteen, blinded by the light in it's most literal form. My wife bested me by telling Alexa again to turn on the lights. How could I be so foolish, I forgot our Echo stood proud in our kitchen. But two can play at this game, &#34;Alexa, turn off the kitchen lights.&#34; And in an instant my wife was left in the dark. While short lived, it felt like victory. Ultimately my wife's plan worked. I was up.    &#34;Alexa, give me my flash briefing.&#34; I listened in as my lovely wife brought me breakfast in bed. &#34;She's too good to you,&#34; I thought but I know what will make her smile, &#34;Alexa, tell 1800Flowers to send my wife flowers.&#34; Boom, best husband ever.    &#34;Alexa, what does my commute look like.&#34; Oh no, I'm running late. I grabbed my winter coat as I walked out the door, remembering my flash briefing told me it was a rather frigid day and that it would stay that way. &#34;Alexa, set the temperature to 70 degrees.&#34;    &#34;Did I turn out the lights?&#34; I asked myself, knowing that I truly did not know the answer. Without wasting time having an internal argument with myself, I simply said &#34;Alexa, turn off all the lights.&#34; The second Dot in our garage responded with a simple, &#34;Ok.&#34;    As I pulled into the garage, the sun already set, I was beat from a long day. The house was dark and my hands full, &#34;Alexa, turn on the dining room lights.&#34; My path was lit as I made a beeline for my favorite chair. &#34;Alexa, who's winning the Texas Bowl.&#34; Any time I hear Wildcats, all I can think of is High School Musical. I tuned in and enjoyed my night. As I crawled into bed I belted out, &#34;Alexa, wake me up in 8 hours.&#34; As I dreamed of Alec Baldwin telling me about early birds. ",
Choose901,"November 6, 2016 ",5.0,"I love my Dot.  My brother got an Echo at Christmas and it seemed neat.  After much reading I decided to jump on this in an attempt to &#34;smarten&#34; up my home a bit.  It is great so far!    I'm using a Broadcom RM2 (IR and RF device) to control my lights (Etekcity RF Outlets) and many other IR items (TV, Xfinity, Receiver, Bluetooth Speaker, etc).  The Dot picks up voice commands very well and functions correctly the majority of the time.  I would suggest doing a few voice trainings with Alexa as it does seem to make a big difference.    Though it took some time to setup, now setting up new items is a breeze!  Really good job with the Dot.  It is so small too :) ",
Andrew,"December 29, 2016 ",5.0,"This device is perfect for my office !    Our family has a full Amazon Echo at home (which we love) and I wanted something smaller and cheaper as a &#34;companion&#34; to my home Echo.    The speakers volume has been perfect for my office size....and helps me with my typical office duties: scheduling, purchasing supplies on amazon and even listening to music playlists.    I love coming in to work in the morning and asking &#34;Alexa, what's on my schedule for today?&#34; or &#34;Alexa, play a classical music playlist for focusing&#34; or &#34;Alexa, add an appointment to my calendar&#34;!

"John A. Panasik III","February 7, 2017 ",5.0,"Since I love cool electronic gadgets the Echo Dot caught my eye. I was tempted to purchase one but was reluctant to do so in fear of my wife nagging at me about spending money on such silly things. So, I held off. But low and behold my son gave me one for Christmas. Happy Happy Joy Joy!!! This little device is cool! Getting started was quick and easy. The hardest task is setting up with your Wi-Fi network which is pretty easy if you're familiar with all of that. Once you're locked in you're ready to go. The free Alexa app will walk you through the setup process.    Anyway, you can link up with many if not all smart devices via Blu-tooth in your home such as wireless speakers, thermostats, lighting etc. Heck, I can see my wife loving this thing. Now that I've been able to demo the Dot without dishing out the cash, I will be purchasing a few more to place around the house. It's just that cool! I may try the Amazon Echo or the tap as well.    So, if you're into cool little electronic devices as am I, this is a cool and useful gadget that the whole family can enjoy.  A great little reminder that we are indeed living in the 21st century, The Dot incorporates some great 21st Century technology. ",
Austin,"March 20, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is able to make your home a little bit like the Startrek Enterprise. Nothing beats coming home from a long day and not having to lift a finger thanks to this device. Simply come home, sit on the couch, and watch Alexa do all the work along your other smart home devices. Alexa is able to turn on my house lights thanks to smart switches. Alexa can turn on my TV and Cable box, thanks to Smart Plugs. Want to know what your commute is looking like to work or the weather outside? No worries Alexa has you covered. There's very little this smart echo dot can't do and it's growing it's skills every single day. I would highly recommend this to people, as I have made this the center of my smart home project. ",
J.G.,"December 27, 2016 ",5.0,"I was disappointed the first day I hooked up the Echo Dot. Alexa didn't seem to understand commands very well, and there didn't seem to be a lot of functionality. I connected the Dot to my Nest and then to my Logitech Harmony Hub, and that made it a little more useful. Originally, I had purchased this thinking I could use voice commands to have Spotify music playing from my Sonos system. Apparently, that functionality may be enabled by Sonos in 2017 but it's not available quite yet. After a week or so, I started using the Dot more, asking about time, weather, and general information when I wasn't near my phone or watch. When I'm not by my remote but want the TV or Apple TV turned on, I can do so via voice commands. At this point, I feel like it's pretty convenient and nice to have for a pretty reasonable price. Alexa isn't perfect. There are a lot of times I will say commands that are not understood, and you often have to use a specific syntax to have 3rd party device commands work which is a little annoying. Additionally, Alexa sometimes think her name is called when you're watching a movie or saying something entirely different and will start speaking at random. While the Dot isn't a must buy, it's fun to have and is pretty convenient at times. ",
"Amazon Customer","October 31, 2016 ",5.0,"I have been a Prime member for years and this is the first review I felt compelled to write. The Echo Dot is a great device. Slightly larger than a hockey puck setting-up the Dot is simple. I know some have worried about the quality of the speakers for playing music, but I would say they are surprisingly good for such a small device. Alexa responds to questions and commands such as &#34;Alexa, what is the weather&#34; and &#34;Alexa, play Christmas music&#34;. You can also order items from Amazon through Alexa, have Alexa tell you a joke, and add other skills through the Alexa App (which is required during set-up). My wife and I find adding items to the shopping list through Alexa especially useful (items are added to a list on the Alexa App. There is also a To-do List that Alexa can add items to). If you use Google Calendar you can also add items to your schedule through Alexa and it will appear on your App. Alexa can do much more with the smart technology available, such as controlling lights, but we have not made that investment yet. Overall I would recommend every house have at least one Dot device. It is very affordable and with so many functions available you will get more than your money's worth. ",
"Joe B","December 3, 2016 ",4.0,"i wish google home and the echo would make a baby.  Once Google gets past its infancy I think it will blow alexa out of the water in every way but price, which is dissapointing in a way.  Amazon has been in this game for years.  Google is already noticeably more responsive and accurate with commands.  That said if I knew nothing about Home this thing would be awesome (aside from some frustrating moments where it won't respond).  With smartthings I can program scenes easily and my echos both respond.  They finally got harmony support for volume up/down etc which is awesome.  my main problems are the questions that you can ask are very limited, she has way more trouble hearing you over background noise than Google, she has a lot more trouble understanding a command.  This is already an awesome tool...but it has a long way to go before it lives up to expectations, which are admittedly high.  They have to remember its competing with your smartphone.  It should be able to replace a good deal of what you can use your smartphone for at home.  Theyll get there but they have a ways to go.  Theyll definitely need to take some notes from Google.  If you get one of these or a google home make sure you get IFTTT. ",

McZaustria,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Got two of these to cover the house (together with the Echo).  Primarily use the Dot's to listen to music where the internal speaker is sufficient if you're in close proximity or you can connect them through the 3.5&#34; stereo (like ear buds) to speakers or an amplifier. Or pair them to BT speakers.  Echo works great with my Wink home automation system (lights, garage door, ceiling fans, locks AC thermostat and switches).  (Another great feature: simply ask &#34;Alexa, where's my stuff?, to get a delivery estimate of things ordered on Amazon) ",
Christopher,"December 30, 2016 ",2.0,"Don't have any doubts. The dot is awesome. The speaker is loud enough and clear enough to be heard across large rooms. The sound is not steep quality but, decent. Set up is quick and easy using the free app. Set up and used within 15 minutes. Dot connects quickly with my speakers via Bluetooth. I have not used the direct line in so I'm not sure how well that works. And without a doubt it truly is smart and constantly learning...as long as you help it. The way you help it get smarter is by answering questions through the app. Questions it asks are you asked Alexa... Is this what you wanted?  Can't wait to get another for other rooms in the house, or quite possibly the full sized echo. ",
"Amritanshu Kar","April 13, 2017 ",5.0,"Its not everyday you come across a product that serves numerous functions for its price. I got it as an open box condition for $40, did not want to pay the full $50 since I knew it sells for $40 during the black friday and prime day sale. Its been worth the penny since then. The most important features that hold me ontu this are the most basic ones.    1. The early morning wakeup alarm and the ability to just tell it to stop.  2. The ability to task the time without looking at your phone.  3. The ability to do currency conversions.  4. The ability to play prime music along with media controls..  5. Ability to keep reminders on the fly.  6. Perform calculations.  7. Play news  8. Trivia  10. Smart Home functions.    These are just the fraction of functions that I use. What makes it different from Siri, Cortana and Google Now is the fact that this has an unidirectional mike which makes it hear across the room. So even though it might not be as advanced as google now, it gets the basics right, which is the most important thing. Apart from that the new update brings the ability to have new hot words like Computer instead of alexa. A must buy. ",

rcox,"March 10, 2017 ",5.0,"I received my Dot right on time and got it working fairly easy..  It's great at some things (mainly related to Amazon) and not so good at others (general questions).  It is very fast at response but does not give good answer to some fairly easy questions.  Some examples:  Ask Alexa &#34;What is the score for the Alabama football game?&#34; and it promptly response the &#34;Alabama vs Texas A&M game is currently..... &#34;  all correct..  but ask  &#34;What is the score of the Texas A&M Football game&#34; and you get &#34;I do not know or understand that question&#34; (I'm an Aggie so of course I am not happy with this)!!  I have tried over and over to get Alexa to understand Texas A&M but she just can't  Either cannot understand Texas A&M or does not understand the question.  I ask &#34;How long have Humans been on Earth&#34; I get &#34;Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question.&#34;  but ask the exact same question to the Google voice search on my Android phone and I get a very good answer...    Also It has problems understand some words.  I cannot get my Dot to understand &#34;May&#34;, It thinks I said &#34;Me&#34;  So I had to change the name of my daughters Amazon Music playlist from May (her name) to Me just so it would play.  Also has problems with &#34;Texas&#34; (the great state!!)..  Must be very clear as it will think you say &#34;Taxes&#34; or &#34;Tex's&#34;.  One observation is that the Alexa system is not very good at Artificial Intelligents.. It cannot figure out what you are trying to say based on the whole phrase.    It is good at Playing Amazon Music and the Alexa App pre set-up items, like your &#34;Flash News&#34;, or  &#34;Sports Update&#34; for items you have already entered into the Alexa App, but not so good at Add Hock Request.  It was good and easy to setting up my Honeywell Thermostat to control the temperature settings by voice.  But, I am frustrated it cannot access my calendar on my Exchange Server and wants me to use Google Calendar, that I do not use.    Overall for $50 it is a good and well designed package product but could be so much better with better word understanding, request execution, and some artificial Intelligents..  Not quire 5 star..  not yet..  Amazon better look out, Google is coming soon!! ",
T.M.,"April 1, 2017 ",2.0,"PARENT WARNING:  You can not filter songs with explicit lyrics for this device and &#34;Alexa Play&#34; picks up where you left off.

There is no way to prevent this via settings, so make sure you are aware and talk to your kids before using the device. I assumed there wouldn't be songs with explicit lyrics available for my son to play via Amazon Prime and didn't know it would pick up where he left off if he played them.    I also bought this device thinking it could give verbal reminders at given times, but it can't. It adds it to your reminders list and you have to ask it to tell you what's on your reminders. The main reason I bought it was for verbal timed reminders.    It is nice/novel, but as a parent it's not what I needed and has introduced some new parenting challenges that I'm not sure are worth it. ",
"Lisa Fite","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"*Alexa, play Jeopardy*  You know how you thought Siri was going to really revolutionize how you use your phone?  Then after a little while of asking her silly questions she just kind of became useless.  Well, Alexa (Dot) is like that.  After the fun of opening the box and setting *her* up, she just sort of becomes another thing on the counter or shelf.  Don't get me wrong, I like her, but she's just not that useful. I ask her about the weather and I enjoy playing Jeopardy every (week) day or having her play a song or two during dinner.  More often than not, I get frustrated because she can't do what I ask or I just plain forget she's there. ",
"H. Ramsey","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"This was a surprise Christmas gift and it turned out to be a very nice surprise! We had thought about purchasing it so the kids could ask it questions, but never seriously considered it. Then we received it gift.  Turns out it does a lot (a LOT) more than answer questions. The answering questions part is great, sometimes you have to rephrase it so Alexa understands what you are saying, but she does a good job answering 90% of the time.    She easily recognizes our voices. Even my 4 year old can trigger it most of the time. When there is a lot of noise in the background she can add a word or two, but she seems to be learning as you go and we have not tried the voice training with her yet (there are 6 of us in the house so a lot of background noise). The key seems to be learning how to say what you are asking. If you want a song then use the word &#34;play&#34; first, if you have a question then use the question word first, etc.    She does so much more than just answer questions. I love the news updates. I don't need to check my phone for top stories only to get distracted by the random junk that pops up with the news. You can choose the news channel (I saw BBC, NPR, CNN, Fox, and more offered). At the end of the top stories (goes about 5 minutes) she gives a weather update and forecast for your area. The update changes every hour so if you feel the need to get more news than go for it. Ask her if it is going to rain in the next hour, what the traffic is like for your commute, and more.    Playing whatever song/artist/station you want is a great way to listen to music. Want to hear a song - just ask.    The timer is useful. I used to grab my phone when I needed to set a timer, now I just ask Alexa. When the kids ask for tablet time or they need to do homework/reading time I can just ask Alexa to set the timer for me. This saves me going to my own tablet or phone (which I usually forget to do) and means the kids really get 15 minutes tablet time when I say they can rather than 45 minutes when I realize I forgot to set the timer.    She has so many skills that we have yet to try, but the ones we have are fun additions. There is a great game, magic door, that works like a choose your own adventure (complete with sound effects). The kids are currently in the middle of trying to find a wizard. You can pause the game and re-enter at any time. Alexa guesses what animal (or thing) you are thinking when you play 20 questions or the animal game. There is a bedtime story skill where she tells a random bedtime story using your child's name. After telling my 4 year old a princess story last night (using her name) she said &#34;now it is time for bed and no you can't have another glass of water&#34;. My daughter thought it was hilarious. It would be great for an elderly or bed-ridden person looking for something to talk to. It will also read audiobooks.    The kids love the joke feature (Alexa tell me a joke) and my husband likes trying to trip her up with random odd questions (What is the meaning of life, who's your daddy, who let the dogs out, etc). Ask her what her resolutions are or the highlights of the year. It is good for a laugh.    I haven't hooked her up to our thermostat yet and we don't have any smart lights/locks so I can't comment on that feature. I am seriously considering moving all my calendar stuff to google so she can plan my day for me. We put a code on ordering so the kids don't accidentally buy something (you can turn the feature off completely if you would rather), but you can still add things to lists when you think about them (then access that list in your amazon account).    Overall, great! I would even consider getting a few more (you could use it as an alarm clock plus extra features in a bedroom, to control things in your living room, this one is in our kitchen for lists/timers/etc).

"Guerrilla Reader","March 28, 2017 ",2.0,"Review of: &#34;All-New Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,&#34; by Amazon.    The manufacturer specifications include: &#34;Echo Dot (2nd Generation) is a hands-free, voice-controlled device that uses Alexa to play music, control smart home devices, provide information, read the news, set alarms, and more.  Connects to speakers or headphones through Bluetooth or 3.5 mm stereo cable to play music from Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.  Controls lights, fans, switches, thermostats, garage doors, sprinklers, and more with compatible connected devices from WeMo, Philips Hue, Samsung SmartThings, Nest, ecobee, and others.  Hears you from across the room with 7 far-field microphones for hands-free control, even in noisy environments or while playing music.  Includes a built-in speaker so it can work on its own as a smart alarm clock in the bedroom, an assistant in the kitchen, or anywhere you might want a voice-controlled computer.  Always getting smarter and adding new features, plus thousands of skills like Uber, Domino's, and more.  Amazon Echo is not required to use Echo Dot.&#34;    The Echo Dot is a really cool limited personal assistant.  It sets up in minutes and begins to work immediately thereafter.  Upon summoning Alexa I was able to subscribe to Prime Music with access to millions of songs; get immediate current weather and moon phase; create a running shopping list; and re-order products from my Amazon order list. Although I am not familiar with all of the features that the Echo Dot allows, one feature that really impresses me is the interactive process with Alexa and the (her) smooth voice.  I just asked Alexa to sync up with my Kindle and she began to read the last book I purchased.  Her voice is incredibly human-like with proper rate of speech, phrasing, inflection, intensity, syntax, and voice stress.  There is little tinny robotic sound, if any.  What an incredible advancement over previous technology used in the Kindle!  I enjoy asking Alexa any multitude of questions which usually she will answer.  Alexa answers my questions on history, facts, etc. and of course will tell a joke on demand.  This is a cool and fun device which I described to my family as a limited personal assistant.  I will update this review as time progresses.  The Echo Dot in terms of a speaker will easily fill an average room with clear sound.  Obviously there is no thumping bass, etc. but the sound is pretty remarkable from such a small device.  I just downloaded the Alexa App onto my iPhone to help me work the unit as well.  Another feature is that Alexa responds immediately.  When I command Alexa to stop the music the unit goes silent as I am finishing the command.  It is amazing.  At this point I would recommend the Echo Dot to anyone and rate it at five stars for a competitive price and lots of features.  I am sure that more will be added each year.  Well done! ",
"Clark Hinckley","March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"As advertised. Small and unobtrusive, works well, connects easily and seamlessly to bluetooth speakers. In reality, there are still only a relatively limited number of truly useful things you do with Alexa unless you are creating an extensive automated home - multiple lights, various living conditions, locks, AV, etc., all with a large price and complex set up. Does not have as many answers to random (but interesting) questions as Siri (which can also answer visually on your phone or iPad screen). But this is a good start, fun to use, and has generally set the standard for simplicity and seamless operation. ",

I have a slew of questions that show on the app correctly but sadly she only answered very few. I have 30 days with BestBuy to return them, so I'll give it a few more tries but it's not looking so good. ",
"B. Gerritsen","April 11, 2017 ",5.0,"I have loved this product! It offers so much in such a little package. However, I have had a couple of issues that have knocked my experience with it:  - difficulty recognizing my voice over the music  - limited phrase recognition  - 2 weeks past the 90 day mark (warranty period) my Dot made a &#34;pop&#34; sound and became unresponsive. I performed a hard-reset which got it working for a while longer, then the issue has occurred a few times since. I contacted Amazon about the issue, but was told there was nothing they could do about it since it's out of warranty. This is truly the reason for my low-star rating. ",
"King Bolete","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"The Echo Dot is awesome if you're looking to connect to a smart home. It's also pretty cool to use just as a handy voice assistant. ALEXA&#34; can be helpful and a lot of fun. It's easy to ask questions and her answers are clear. I'm still learning about the features and how to access them, but so far it's a breeze.    You can ask about the weather, the time, the latest news, set an alarm, set a timer, ask a question of Wikipedia, ask what song or singer is currently on, pause, play, stop, change volume, ask how to spell something, she tells jokes and plays 20 Questions or Jeopardy...the list goes on and on and it's all done just with your voice. At this price, the Dot seems to be well worth the investment and a lot of fun! ",
"Valerie Ballard","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I love Alexa!  She does so much for me!  She plays any music I ask for ($3.99 for Amazon Music Unlimited for Prime members on one device). She reads my Kindle books to me. Okay she doesn't have the same voice inflections as with Audible, but her narrations don't cost $15 per month either! She gives me traffic reports. She plays games with me. She controls all of my smart devices, lights, plugs etc.  She keeps track of my schedule, sets alarms, and even says nice things to me.  I have only had her for a couple of weeks and I find more uses for her every day.  They're always adding new skills, and best of all, they're free!  As I grow my Smart Home, I haven't found anything that she hasn't been able to handle.  Just search Amazon for things that say &#34;works with Alexa.&#34;  Needless to say, I am very happy with my new room mate.  She doesn't eat a lot and never makes a mess.  She never argues and is always supportive.  She wishes me good sleep at night, greets me nicely in the morning and when I come home.  What more could you want?  My home will never be without Alexa again!  :)  Santa is going to be bringing some of these to my family members too! ",
"Matt H.","January 14, 2017 ",5.0,"This is overall a good, quality product. We use it almost exclusively for alarms and playing music off of spotify playlists. If you have the volume cranked, she may have trouble hearing, but this is typically not an issue.    Pros:  Great alarm clock/timer  Plays spotify playlists  easy for the kids to use  Shopping list is nice    Cons:  Skills are not quite smart enough yet  Siri has more answers for things  Ecobee control is not intuitive (as are most specialized skills)    I would definitely buy this again, and I am thinking about getting more for the house. The convenience factor is way up there and it looks great. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 6, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought this for my kitchen.  After the warranty expired it started malfunctioning.  Turns off after one minute of playing music.

Of course amazon was willing to talk me through trouble shooting but not replace a defective product that is only four months old. ",
"Linda B Halverson","November 16, 2016 ",4.0,"Absolutely love my Dot!! Does exactly what they say it does. Still working on adding skills. Recommend signing up for the email that gives u recommendations and alerts u to new skills as they are added. Speaker is good quality for its size. I also ordered the Vaux speaker unit (just available 4-17, $49.00) and received yesterday. The Dot drops in the top making it look similar to the full size Echo. the Vaux has a rechargeable battery so in my case, I leave it plugged up in the bedroom and can disconnect the Vaux unit and move from room to room. They say it has approx. 6 hours of play time on the battery. I have not tested that yet but plan to soon. So far, love that purchase too! ",
"Cynthia J. Salim","April 4, 2017 ",1.0,"DOT can be frustrating but I do enjoy the convenience when it works. I have two DOTS and a speakers connected to each DOT. Each DOT is used on a different floor of my home. The DOT in my bedroom is connected to a speaker by WIFI also connected to that DOT is a smart plug that controls a lamp. The DOT in my living area is connected using a cable to a speaker. I intend to have smart thermostats installed and connected too. I enjoy the music selection available using DOT. And,  I enjoy the convenience of weather reports, news, time, alarms, etc.    My beef is that sometimes DOT does not work using the voice mode. I can usually get what I want by going into my ALEXA APP and making a manual request. This happens most often at night when I want to have my lamp turned off or my music turned on. I am not sure why this happens. Generally, in the morning when I try the same request that failed at night, it works. When these failures occur, I check to make sure WiFi is working and it always is. ALEXA also lights up indicating that she hears me but does not execute the request. I am starting to wonder if I have made a mistake by buying the expensive Smart thermostats.    If anyone has any tips on how to get DOT to be more consistent, please share. ",
Theresa1,"April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"I like the integration for the smart plugs.  It will be nice that when asked to look something up it does not rely on wikipedia.  Right now it's functionality is limited.  At least it can tell me the weather, control my lights and play music.    Update 4/15/17:  Third party apps does not work seamless with the echo dot like the Kasa app for TP link, half of the the time Alexa cannot find the device.  It is nice just to speak from across the room to turn the lights on if the devices will work smoothly together.  I tried the Apple home kit with another brand smart plug for comparison, Apple app set up and the integration of the third party app has less steps and they work well together. ",
"Nicholas Ferri","March 9, 2017 ",4.0,"I purchased this Dot for a relative, but have one of my own at home. Alexa is fantastic. The Dot links to your wireless internet very easily and using the Alexa App is simple. Be careful not to download too many skills since you tend to forget the commands to open them if you have too many, but with practice, you'll be fine. There are more skills and more products offering Alexa compatibility added daily making her the best in the market at home personal assistant. I typically use her with weather, daily news, traffic updates, the shopping list, the Philips Hue link, my Vivint Home Security (Note that she can not open or unlock anything due to security issues), and definitely my If This Then That link (which I recommend digging into). As mentioned above, she has a ton of Skills that she can learn which make life at home more fun (trivia, word adventures, games, jokes, etc) and a lot simpler (allrecipes, fitbit, etc). I have easily convinced a good portion of my family to buy a Dot if not the full speaker Echo, and would highly recommend her to anyone. I would give her 6 stars if possible. ",
"R. Kosh","March 30, 2017 ",3.0,"I kept putting off buying an Echo and now I'm glad I did. The Dot does everything the Echo does but with a smaller form factor and price. It was cheap enough that I bought two--one for the living room and another for my bedroom. The Dot is actually sensitive enough that I could have survived with one, but wanted to be able to control the bedroom lights without having to shout to the Dot in the living room. With two, they automatically work together to select the one closest to you when you speak. I like being able to get into bed at night, and just saying, &#34;Alexa, turn off the bedroom light.&#34; I can even use it to wake me up if I want to get up earlier than my alarm clock would.  It's a lot easier to tell Alexa to wake me up at 4:30 than it is to reset my alarm clock for one day.    I'm using to more and more every day, everything from playing music to turning on lights and all it takes is my voice.  I should have done this sooner. The Dot makes a lot of sense, especially if you have an upstairs and a downstairs and don't want to have to yell downstairs to add soap to your Amazon basket. Great job, Amazon. ",
"Tyson Eng","January 8, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought one Echo Dot for the center portion of the main floor at the house that is open floor. It took me awhile to set up the Dot with the Alexa app on the fire tablet, but the instructions on the app was concise and clear. I have used the Echo Dot to play music from the Bluetooth speakers on the music list from Amazon music store. Unfortunately I don't have premium Spotify and can not use their services.  I have set reminders, alarms, received phone numbers, and a bunch of other things. I decided to order another Echo Dot for my bedroom.  I guess it will make it much easier to set the alarm versus setting the time on my alarm clock that varies with work.    I had thought the sound with be limited with the built in speaker, but it is pretty loud. I thought about the full size Echo, but I have component stereo in the open room in the next room that it did not make sense.    Update I ordered and received another Echo Dot.  Put it in the bedroom to replace my alarm clock that I have to manually set. It would be nice if the chord for the Dot was another foot longer. Otherwise I have only good things to say about Alexa with her replies. ",
BoilerGator,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have the Echo Dot and Google Home. The Echo Dot is great for playing Amazon Prime Music, Audible books, and specific skills/apps through Amazon (e.g., smart home lights and thermostats can be controlled by Alexa). However, Google Home is much better at general questions, recipes, facts, etc. Google Home can be linked to your Pandora or other streaming music account, so it will also play music. I think the speaker for the Amazon Echo is better than Google Home. You can't beat the price of the Echo Dot. ",
"Aaron Thompson","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"The voice recognition ability is amazing, and the Amazon Echo team is constantly improving things behind the scenes. Alexa's voice is very pleasant and easy to understand, despite the size of the Dot. Sound quality can easily be improved through the 1/8&#34; stereo jack or by pairing with Bluetooth devices. The light ring is a great way to confirm you were heard. From a kid who grew up with Speak & Spell, the Echo Dot definitely shows how far technology has come. Definitely recommended to any techie out there. $50? What are you waiting for? ",
"Jane Johnson,  Trusted Reviews","April 23, 2017 ",4.0,"The Amazon Echo Dot is amazing technology.

I Love to sit at the end of the day in my favorite chair and say,  &#34;Alexa,  play classical piano&#34;....and immediately, the music fills the room.  Your grocery and to do list shows on your smartphone. That is not even half of what she can do.  Turn lights on/off  turn TV on,  much, much more.

It's small size makes it great for a beside table or other area where the full-size is too large.The main difference, other than size, is music quality is a bit less than big Echo. It still sounds good; but if you want fuller sound, watch for a sale, and get yourself a good Bluetooth speaker. I have paired a smart plug with it so I can voice-control a bedroom lamp. Small package, great results. If you want Echo benefits, but the budget is tight, you can't go wrong with the Dot. ",

I only wish when listening to music I could create a playlist that Alexa would play. Meaning I would love to say Alexa, play &#34;my favorites&#34; and have her do that.  I love amazon unlimited music too and how prime members get a discount. ",
"MommaCX3 ☀️","March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"Great product. All the awesome features of Alexa minus the exceptional sound quality of the Echo. If you don't have an Echo you wouldn't know the sound isn't as good though (I don't think). We have the Dot in my son's room.

Just make sure that you don't have it read a story with a character named Alexa or Alexis. That can have amusing results.    I also use it to make shopping lists and convert weights and measurements. It will also play radio stations and give the weather. ",
Tevern,"April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"This review is for the Echo Dot, version 2.  Up front I will say that I have purchased the original Echo, the Echo Dot, v1 and the Echo Dot, v2.  I love the idea of the product, but the quality of the Dot 2 is not good.  My original Echo (purchased 11/3/15) and the Dot 1 (purchased 3/3/16) are working fine.  They come with a 1 year warranty. The Dot 2 come with a 90 day warranty.  There is a reason for that - the Dot 2 is a piece of crap.  They lowered the price and the quality of the product.  The Dot 2 (purchased 9/18/16) died on 3/3/17, less than six months in use.  It was never dropped or abused in any way.  One day it simply said it had trouble connecting to the internet; I tried to reconnect it, but it consistently failed.  I got hold of tech support and have spent hours, literally, on the phone with them and they have not been able to get it to work either.  The error code (73441), they say they can't find in their manual. Because it is out of warranty I now own a worthless piece of junk.  Beware. ",
"Robyn P","February 15, 2017 ",5.0,"After having the Dot for a few weeks, I have to say Alexa doesn't know much! I ask simple questions and I get &#34;Hmmm, I don't know how to answer that&#34;.  I put a series of questions to both Alexa and Ok Google and Google answered them all. Alexa couldn't answer any. I understand  you must enable skills, and I have, but for basic questions??? Google is the clear winner here.  That being said, I pay for the Unlimited  music for $3.99 and basically use the Dot as a personal  DJ. I tell her what to play and she does it. For $50, it's a neat gadget, but my next gadget will be Google Home. ",
"Susan Layman","March 15, 2017 ",1.0,"My husband's doctor suggested I order this for my husband who has Alzheimers.  The doctor thought it would be helpful so that he could always know the time, date, weather, what sports teams are playing. etc.  Unfortunately he is not fast enough with his question after he says Alexa so it hasn't worked for the original purpose.  I use it a lot and enjoy listening to the music while I'm doing things in the house.  It's also fun with my nieces and nephew come over because they can ask Alexa to tell them a kids joke. ",
"Jon P.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I have loved my Amazon Echo that I have had for nearly 2 years.  I love being able to use the Amazon Echo for voice control of my living room lights and other compatible devices (i.e. my Nest thermostat).  The cost of the Amazon Echo was the only thing holding me back from putting one in other parts of the house.  As soon as I saw the Echo Dot (2nd gen) advertised for sale I immediately ordered 3 of them to put in other parts of my house.  I already had a good speaker system in my bedroom so I added a Dot there.  I put another in my wife's office and attached a set of Bose speakers and I put one in the Kitchen (no external speakers but that one is not for listening to music).    All 3 Dots were incredibly easy to set up and all are working perfectly.  The only difference I noticed about them compared to the Amazon Echo (besides the sound quality) is the dots seem to take slightly longer to turn my lights on and off.  I am not 100% sure they take longer but it seems like they are just a bit slower but not enough to really make a difference. ",
Raj,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"A perfect Operating System for a smart home. Have connected it with my ecobee3, Osram Lighitify, Microsoft outlook account, Spotify account, Bose speakers.

It seems like there are more and more things it is able to do and can hear you so well it's mind boggling. I have gotten so use to Apple Siri sucking so bad I was a little nervous, but Echo is on a completely different level.

"TG RabidBeaver","April 22, 2017 ",5.0,"Next to sliced bread, the wheel and fire, the Amazon Echo Dot may be the single greatest invention ever (perhaps even better than gravity itself).    I bought one after seeing a good friend's setup where he utilizes his dot along with his Nest thermostat and his Hue Lighting.  I must say, anything that helps me be lazier when I am at home, it truly gets two thumbs up.  Now if I could just convince Alexa to bring me 2 fingers of my favorite Bourbon while I'm watching the game......    Come on Amazon, make it happen! ",

Everyday it's &#34;Alexa turn on the lights&#34; then she thinks for a minute and nothing happens, so then I say it again and by then it usually works.

As well as, other mobile apps that I have previously used, were found in Alexa skills.  I normally don't write any review.... however this was worth taking time to share my excitement about the Amazon Echo Dot 2nd Generation.

Should have just spent the extra money for the Google home.  It works for controlling the thermostat like 50% of the time lol!

We have a household prime account, but since it is in my name. He can't access prime music on the device. We could switch it to my account and then I could access music I purchased, but then he wouldn't be able to access music he purchased. I called Amazon and asked if we could merge our accounts.  The answer is NO.  You also cannot apparently have more than one account associated with it. You can open a new account and purchase all your music again was what they said. It is also very difficult to figure out what music you can play. We are old enough to remember LPs and we want to own our music.  That just doesn't work very well with a device like this. Too bad. It is a nice idea, but having it as an individual device rather than linked to the house is stupid. ",

So nice to ask her for the temperature before I head outside. She's very quick and she understands very well. She will tell you the temperature in other places as well, just ask.

I'm a bit of a techie and while I have other devices that will do many of these activities, it is great to be able to get the functionality by voice command and for this price who could ask for more. When initially getting the device, it was challenging with the number of commercials that were on to promote the device as every time that Alexa was said on screen it would awaken my device. However this has improved over time and she no longer responds to them. By the same token, it was a bit challenging using the alarm functionality in the mornings particularly while I was sick as she would not respond to my morning voice but this seems to have improved as well. Overall I love this device and have recommended it to a few friends and coworkers who were considering them as Christmas requests/gifts. ",

KCB,"December 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I already had the original Echo, use it every day and really enjoy it.  I was thinking that it would be nice to have the same functions in a smaller package for our bedroom.  One of the main things we use the Echo for is to listen to Prime Music and I wasn't sure how well the Dot would do for that purpose.  I think that the sound quality of my larger Echo is very good.    While the functions of the Dot and the full sized Echo are the same, the Dot clearly doesn't have the same sound quality.  For the low price, it wouldn't be fair to expect it to sound the same.  This is offset by your ability to attach the Dot via Bluetooth, to either speakers or headphones if you like.  We have found though that when we want to listen to music in bed while reading, the sound from the Dot is still fine for our needs, at low volume.    Overall, I think that the Dot is an excellent value, it is small enough that you can put it almost anywhere and it is really nice to have in the room for the many features that it has. ",

It does exactly the same as the echo except for the speaker system and I am okay with that. It got here yesterday and I already had the app on my phone and I started playing around with all the skills. I love the night light and the Food Network skill. I played Jeopardy and did Seinfeld trivia just for the fun of it. I love that I can wake up in the middle of the night and quietly whisper Alexa and the device comes on and I can ask it what time it is. No more fumbling for my cell phone and being Blinded by the Light. I love Amazon and all of their products. I have a Kindle and three Fire Sticks and now we enjoy the Echo and the echo Dot.

Mark,"December 17, 2016 ",4.0,"Works as advertised, received my second dot today.  First one is in the living room and the second one is in my bedroom.  Setup was a breeze through the app. Sound was great, but I did try a Bluetooth headset, and she paired with it.  All one has to do is say Alexa volume 1 for low or five for medium volume, etc.  I also paired to a wireless speaker, the jam touch. Again all volume is just speak to Alexa.  Also if you want great sound connect it to your sound system.  When the alarm goes off it will definitely get you out of bed.    I am considering another one for the kitchen. Also the light bulbs, I keep losing the remote for my lamps or it's always away from where your sitting.    Getting my set up for smart devices is intriguing and exciting at the same time.  The future is now!!  Don't delay in buying this item, you can't go wrong for the price.    You do have to set up the first time with your wi-fi so you have to remember your router name and password for the initial setup. Also, download the Alexa app and setup is a breeze, just follow the on screen instructions. ",
Bilgewater,"December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Alexa (Echo Dot) works beautifully.  The sound is a bit different than her big sister, but that's to be expected as she's so petite and doesn't have as much space for a bigger speaker.  Her big sister is downstairs and is constantly in use for household items...and the occasional joke, while the little sister is upstairs and so gets less use...generally at bedtime.  The big sister came first, at Christmas time, while little sister is only a couple of weeks old.  A great invention, and very useful.  We love being able to add items to our shopping list that is then available via iPhone when shopping. ",
"Amazon Customer","November 12, 2016 ",5.0,"This is a great affordable option to turn each room into a smart room. It connects to speakers via Bluetooth or with a supplied audio cable so if you have an existing system this would be a good addition. The only 2 reasons why I knocked a star off was 1. The sound isn't great unless you have a speaker for it and if you're looking for a great sounding echo then just spring for the bigger one that you can even have a payment plan for added convenience. And 2. The thing that really bugged me was the response time after saying &#34;alexa&#34; was a bit slower that that of my full sized echo AND my echo dot gen 1. But I will say for the cost this is a great option for any home and would go great in a kids room to use for music and even helps my kids with spelling and basic math as well as reading audio books to them so that alone to me makes the 50 bucks well worth it. I highly recommend this amazing product, I've been using mine constantly since I got it and Alexa has become the hub that truly converted my home into a smart home. ",
Shawn,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I love it! Now when I shout at something it talks back or does what I want! Love It! Love it even more now it works with my Lutron Caseta Wireless to turn on and off my lights in my living room and in my back bedroom, I'm going to install more into the master bedroom and into the middle room, I don't even have to get off the couch to turn on/off the lights all I have to do is just talk to it.    Although I do wish it would stop answering to commercials, I got a pizza because a commecial for it ordered it. ",
Anthony,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"What garbage.  No sooner had I rewired my business the unit stopped responding.  It worked for less than a week  Looks like this is a common problem.  Now after doing the work required to to have a smart home I am left with a useless control hub.  I will be upgrading the the original echo as there appear to be less of these issues.  This will be Amazons last chance with me.  If the echo has the same issues as the dot I will be doing my shopping elsewhere.  What a bait and switch.  Look, do this on the cheap.  O product failure, oh sorry its a design flaw, would you like to upgrade for an additional $150? ",
sambon,"February 27, 2017 ",4.0,"Worked well for 1.5 months. Suddenly stop working. Only listening, no response returned. Sometimes tells me 'lost connection' kind of excuse.  Tried restart, deregister, factory reset, wifi restart, router restart, modem restart. Everything ends up with same result, not respond. Help me.    Update (back to two stars from one):  Now it starts working well again. What was my three hours of struggle? If it was server problem, Amazon should notify affected user the issue ASAP. Not very comfortable experience. I leave two star feedback until I confirm it works without trouble for over three month. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 7, 2017 ",1.0,"I've got 3 Echo Dots now around the house. The Dots are great and handy. The problem is the app, which doesn't work 80% of the time. If there's a problem with Alexa though, it tells you to go to the app. If you need to set something up or change a setting, you need to go to the app - which won't open. And need help? Yup, that's in the app too - which won't open. Even the web browser version won't load sometimes. Even with the newest update to &#34;fix bugs&#34; - it won't open. I don't understand why Amazon isn't fixing this issue. ",
"S Family","March 7, 2017 ",2.0,"Does a few things nicely, but dont find that I use it much. A bit of a hassle to get her to understand me accurately sometimes. I would love it more if things you said to the echo auto recognized what app you need without having to activate the app, listen to the intro crap just to get to what you need. I can do that quicker via google on a lot of stuff. Overall cool to see the progress technology is making. She works intermittently at best with our honeywell smart thermostats for the house. ",
Pippi,"November 6, 2016 ",4.0,"I bought the dot because we already had the Echo with the built in speaker. I had to get the Dot because I wanted to sync it to my Bose system. I was very disappointed. The dot does not function as well as the regular Echo. Voice controls are weak. Have to ask questions multiple times. Dot misunderstands and doesn't do what you ask. Thought there was something wrong with my unit. Had to phone amazon and was told the speaker is different on the dot and not as good. It is tedious to use and can be a big pain in the butt to get it to understand you and give you what you asked for.  Would not recommend. ",
"Carl B.","April 25, 2017 ",3.0,"I'm a big fan of the echo product line. I own Echo Dot and the Alexa full size version. The only downside to the echo dot 2nd generation is the volume controls. The original Echo Dot had turning mechanism where you would physically move the outside Rim left a right to increase the volume. The second generation uses two buttons to increase or lower the volume. Unfortunately these buttons are not backlit so you can't see them in the dark or even low light. Overall the sound is much more improved with this second generation. ",

It does get your music from your phone if you have some. I just don't have music in my phone, so I will be getting the monthly music from amazon. You can ask it ANYTHING you would look up online.

"Paul Sellers","April 1, 2017 ",4.0,"I have to admit that I was really looking forward to my Amazon Echo.  Reading the reviews and online reports, it sounded like an awesome little device.  I have had it for about a week now and it is kind of a disappointment.  Everyone said that the range was outstanding and that the device could hear you speaking from another room in the house.  Well, no.. not so much.  My apartment living room is about 13 X 15 and the Echo has a very hard time hearing me.  I can have the TV off and I still have to be right on the device to get it to respond, usually I have to repeat the key word several times before it will decide to activate.  I have even go so far as to hold the device in my hand and speak loudly to it, still only responds when it feels like it.  But – when you can get its attention, it works ok.. the music choice with Prime are outstanding and it can do most functions that I have managed to ask.  There is a lot of potential for this item.  But what kills it is the lack of response to the key word.  I should not have to yell at the device three or four times to get its attention.  Oh, and don’t even think of getting its attention if you have it playing music – you really need to wait for the singer to take a breath or for the song to end, then you can maybe make a new request.

"Nettie M.","March 10, 2017 ",4.0,"I love my new Echo Dot! I ordered two, one for my livingroom and one for the kitchen. I love how small and compact it is! It's nice to just speak out loud any google questions that I may have or have her to shuffle a variety of songs from different artist. She (Alexa) does so much and her response to some of the odd questions that I ask her is quite funny! :-) I told my grandfather how much I enjoyed it and he ordered the original full-sized one. The sound quality between the two is a big difference but from my understanding, they both do the exact same thing. If I had a choice between the larger Echo or the Echo Dot I would most likely go with the larger/original version because the sound quality is phenomenal! Although, the Dot has great sound but the original is superb! Maybe I will put the larger/original Echo on my birthday list, I could always use another one in my bedroom!  :-) ",

I would want to get a google home at least so you can google. This should have a google skill or something so you can google something like Alexa google chicken Alfredo. It could also use yahoo or bing. The voice recognition is aweful because it picks up the tv. It can't even hear my voice. More Skills could be added. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"So far so good my son and I like I would say I love it if it wasn't for the fact that my phone and old Kindle does not support the Alexa app. So if you do purchase this make sure you have an up to date Kindle or room on your phone to download the app. I made room on my phone and the Alexa app still do not work when I downloaded it. So I had to call Amazon and they were nice, patient, and a big help walking me through setting it up through my computer but unfortunately I am not getting to use my Echo Dot to the fullest because I can not use the app which Alexa likes to remind me that I could do this or that by accessing the app...wish I could.

V,"January 22, 2017 ",3.0,"Pros:  These work as expected:   - weather info   - traffic   - prime music   - answering general questions   - telling jokes    Cons:   - cannot order anything via prime    Most voice commands work as expected with Echo Dot except voice purchasing. It is enabled in the app. I ask Alexa to buy something. It finds it in the order history and asks &#34;Would you like to buy it now?&#34; I answer very clearly &#34;yes&#34;. Alexa repeats &#34;Would you like to buy it now?&#34; I repeat &#34;Yes&#34; however Alexa proceeds to tell that it cannot tell if I want to buy the item. I tried this 5 times and also tried other answers such as &#34;I do&#34;, &#34;Buy it&#34; but nothing works. This would be huge deal for someone who was actually planning to use Alexa to make purchases on Amazon. For me it is not the primary use case so taking off 2 stars only.    I hope Amazon will fix this asap! ",

DenverDonkey,"March 9, 2017 ",3.0,"I'm having fun with Alexa, but if she costs more, I would return her (the Echo Dot) for a full refund.  The product doesn't perform anywhere close to the way it is advertised.  According to the online commercial, the device will hear a command even from an adjoining room.  Nope.  In fact, I have one on my night stand and she doesn't even hear &#34;Alexa&#34; from 18&#34; away unless I sit up in bed and face the device directly.  Shame on whoever manufactured this thing.  Plus, the first one I bought overheated the first week I had it and stopped working.  However, Amazon replaced it with their excellent refund/replacement police and the replacement is working fine.

cv,"March 23, 2017 ",5.0,"My 3rd, with the first 2 being Echo, and a black Dot. I love them all! I purchased this one for my kitchen because white will fit better with the decor.  In my opinion, if you have internet, you need at least one of these! I warn you, however, that what might begin as a novelty purchase will soon become a necessary and useful addition to your home! I simply call out what I need at the store and it's recorded for me. I can make a to-do list like this, as well. I can check the weather while getting dressed, so I know how many layers to wear, look up ingredients, substitutions,recipes, and even meal ideas while standing in the kitchen with my hands full! She's a calculator, spell-checker, news broadcast, shopping directory, history lesson, game opponent, dictionary, encyclopedia, music channel, timer, alarm clock, movie guide, personal assistant, book-reader, wellness coach, sports authority and trivia master... and lots more! Dot is blue tooth enabled, so you can hook up your own speaker.( Dot is as loud as an alarm clock on her own) I have purchased several compatible smart plugs and switches when on sale, and my units operate some of my lighting, which is more handy than I ever imagined it could be- like when I get up at 3am and want to see where I am going.

"Reasonable Reviewer","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"The Echo Dot  seems like a great idea. Theoretically, there are many services that you can activate using your voice alone. In practice, it is mostly a mechanism to encourage further Amazon purchases.     I now view Alexa as a surly teenager with a shopping problem.     Alexa does not understand half of what I say, and most of the time I cannot get the apps to work.    Alexa will often say &quot; I don't understand that question.&quot;  Alexa will often suggest that you buy something.     Let's be honest. Alexa is not designed to be a community service by Amazon. I get it, but there needs to be more functionality added  before this is a must-have item for the home.     On the positive side, Alexa will pair with your Bluetooth device. It took me four or five tries, but now I can stream music from another device through Alexa.    Also, I found customer service for Alexa to be sorely lacking.    There is a lot of potential here, but it has not arrived yet. ",

It was a little tricky connecting to my Wi-Fi. through  my computer and had to use my ipad instead. Once it connected, there was little else to do. I've had it two days and have asked it all kinds of things: the weather, conversion of dollars to English pounds, presidents, books, soft music. My husband asked it a high level math problem that it couldn't answer. I can live with that. I've told everyone I know about it.

BigDog1,"January 18, 2017 ",3.0,"I bought a full-sized Echo a while back, and really enjoy it.    I recently bought a couple of Echo Dots to use in other rooms.  Because the Dots have a 3.5mm speaker output jack, I bought a set of inexpensive powered PC speakers to try out with the Dot, and was quite impressed -- it makes a Dot into a poor man's full size Echo.  Cool!    So I ended up buying a 6-pack of Dots, and 6 sets of inexpensive ($10) Logitech speakers, to give out to my relatives for Christmas.  Each Dot and speaker set cost right at $50, which seems like a bargain. I know my relatives are going to enjoy these. ",
Bleewzg,"December 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I wanted to respond to the reviewer who complained that his elderly parents had only Apple products and therefore could get nothing out of using the echo. My husband is both visually and hearing impaired, and we use exclusively Apple products. However by getting free accounts which is easy to do on Pandora and TuneIn my husband is able to operate Echo and listen to a lot  of his favorite music by just speaking to this amazing box. I do find that it takes more training than I thought would be necessary. I am 80 years old and my husband is 84, and we are pretty tech savvy for her age. But so far I am giving Echo a five star rating because with a little more learning, we've enabled someone who is almost deaf and blind to enjoy listening to his favorite music again. And I am enjoying some of the fun questions and answers and also using the meditation skill and the shopping list and the alarm. Don't give up Apple users I think iTunes music is the next thing to be able to transfer. ",

"Amazon Customer","December 26, 2016 ",5.0,"For music lovers - DO NOT agree to Alexa's suggestion for Amazon Music Unlimited unless you don't mind a monthly fee.  The Alexa voice suggested Amazon Music Unlimited, and it inquired if I wanted to subscribe. I clearly enunciated NO - twice - but it still signed me up as a member. This means there is an automatic monthly payment to them.  I was signed up for something I did not want, and then I had to look around for how to cancel it in order to not have recurring charges.  The question &#34;do you want Amazon Music Unlimited&#34; is the equivalent of a lie when one becomes enrolled by answering NO.  Marketing really means manipulating, and Amazon is a giant - globally - for this.  As always - for any product by any company - buyer beware of any way a corporation can screw you.

It's funny because it sits right in front of my monitor and if the Dominoes commercial comes on where he orders pizza from Alexa it will turn on. I'm mostly disappointed that it can't be used as a speakerphone with my mobile phone but that's my own fault for not doing the research. Big thumbs up on sound quality for music.

I was excited to be able to keep shopping lists, calendar events, and have a back up alarm clock.. WRONG...You see I am not allowed to use those features as my husband is a prime member and so my dot is required to be tied to his account, so everything I add gets posted to his settings.  I am not allowed my settings.  Mine default to whatever he set up on his account.  Also, I cannot figure out why but it cannot hear my voice.  We have tried different locations.  I have tried talking to it.  I have tried whispering.  I have tried modulating my voice to be more bass.  I have screamed at it.  About the only thing I did not try before turning it off was throwing it against the wall.  My husband is the only one that still uses his and only as a back up alarm clock.

"Cade Lusk","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"While I don't use this product as often as I'd like, I'm really impressed with the Echo Dot. It does what its advertised as doing, and its a really inexpensive alternative to the most popular in home AI. However, there are some serious areas that need improving for me to be using this everyday like I imagined.    The sound is a lot clearer and louder than I would have expected from the Dot. While I don't own the original Echo, I do own several speakers of similar size that cost double what the dot costs, and the sound is greater than half of the quality. Not a whole lot of graininess or anything particularly bad to speak of. Now, you're not going to get surround sound quality out of it, but it gets the job done.    Setup was a breeze. The included instructions could be followed by a child, and the whole process took about ten minutes. The hardest thing was connecting to my WiFi, and even that was just a matter of downloading the app.    Functionally, this product is everything you'd expect. Its a responsive AI that answers questions and interacts with (some) other apps to do cool things like turn on the lights or play your favorite news. One thing to mention here is that Alexa (I had to change the wake-word to &#34;echo&#34;, Alexa is a family member's name) will just search for universal sources to do these things unless you specify otherwise (looking at TuneIn for news radio, Amazon Music for all music requests, etc). Sometimes that can be a pain, but most of the time its right on.    The &#34;Skills&#34; store is pretty flush with cool skills to &#34;teach&#34; Alexa. While I understand that there is a lot of integration with the rest of the tech community, I was a little disappointed to not see more integration with the apps I have on my (android) phone. That's always been a little bit of a short-coming with Amazon though, because they always seem to truly be the less popular Third Party in the app space.    There were a couple of things that I wish someone had thought to include in this generation.    First, you cannot control your dot through separate accounts. For example, me and my Fiance share the device at home, but we don't have just one account for the house. She has to sign in under my name in order to use the app to change settings or add skills.    Second, its really, really, REALLY inconvenient that this unit has to ALWAYS be plugged in. I understand there are some battery attachments that you can buy... but seriously. This seems like a wrong move from Amazon. The small size insinuates an ease of movement. If I go from my kitchen to my bathroom, I just want to continue hearing whatever I was listening to. Maybe I want to move the unit into the bedroom without killing the power. Either way, this seems like step back in time to an era where everything electronic needed to have disposable batteries or had to be plugged in.    Last, the voice recognition over its own volume. The Echo is advertised as having many directional microphones that are supposed to make it able to hear you from any direction and over noise. However, my experience has been mixed. If I need to communicate with the Echo while its playing, say, the news - I have to SHOUT over it to get my message across. To top that, there's a microphone &#34;remote&#34; you can buy for it but no in app functionality for the microphone I carry everywhere - my phone. Again, you can't control this thing via voice commands from your phone. Huge oversight that's probably intentional to get you to buy the remote.    This is a great little gadget that has a TON of potential. I still love using mine when I do, and I think it will be a lot nicer once I get my Smart Home setup going. However, there are still a lot of areas of improvement that I really don't see as being all that difficult to implement. 3/5, I would recommend, just not strongly at this point. ",
"Mister Gizmo","November 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I was just learning to live with my disappointment over an LG &#34;smart&#34; TV I'd bought recently that is anything but smart. In addition, it has the worst user interface I've seen since the 1980s. Fortunately, Amazon has brought out a device that works, works well, and is very intuitive. It was a little bit of a problem setting up, because the instructions are so limited, but once over that small hump, it's been fine. I'm surprised at how well it understands commands, even with so-far limited exposure to my voice to learn from.    If there's a frustration, it's mainly that the Dot (and Alexa devices in general) have a lot more potential than what's available right now. As with any new device, it takes a while for third parties to figure out what capabilities are possible, and then to spend the time and effort developing them. As just one example, I could see the Dot acting as an intercom, even a rudimentary telephone to connect Dot/Alexa users. I'm thinking particularly of elderly or handicapped people who'd like something that only requires voice commands. But I'm willing to wait. And since most of the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, the Dot's hardware should be good for a few years.    Now if Amazon would only invest a little more time to bring its Kindle browser, which has been in beta for years and years, into something that actually works. You can do it, Amazon! The Dot shows that you can be great at software if you really try. :-)    Update: I did experience one wrinkle when buying a Dot for a friend. It arrived pre-registered to me. Trying to use the normal setup for the new user didn't work. I finally realized that I had to de-register it from my account, sign out of the Alexa app (and reset the Dot), then sign in as a new registrant. This is explained in Alexa help, but it wasn't obvious at first. I don't know if it's the case, but if you buy it as a &#34;gift&#34; in the purchasing process, it &#34;may&#34; arrive unregistered, which would be good. I suspect Amazon ships them registered to streamline the setup by eliminating a couple of steps. ",
"Brian S","January 31, 2017 ",3.0,"Love it. As soon as these came out I bought one. I didn't need the nice speaker of the Echo, i just use it mostly for home automation. Ties into Samsung's Smartthings nicely.    What surprises me the most is that more often that not it understands my 3 year old son. This is both amazing and annoying as he loves to say (in a very muttled toddler voice), &#34;Alexa, turn off all the lights&#34;. To which Alexa will reply (80% of the time), &#34;OK&#34;. Every light in my house goes off... I'm not pointing this out as a negative, its quite remarkable she understands him correctly 80% of the time. The other 20% she can't understand him, but who can blame her, I can barley understand him sometimes.    We also love using this as a cooking timer, but even more so as countdown timer for bath time. It helps my son cope with playtime being over, he will even set her timer for me.    The Alexa platform is growing fast. Some things I hope to see soon:      -Text readouts and replies (for multiple people, e.g. &#34;Alexa send message to Brian from jessica's phone&#34;, even better perhaps someday she will distinguish 1 voice from another, using this as a security measure so only I can send messages from phone)    -Calendar Events    -API integration that will allow Alex to alert you to items (e.g. &#34;your front has been open for over 5 minutes&#34;, or &#34;Someone just rang your doorbell&#34;) ",
"Todd P. Hubbard","October 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I am mostly thrilled with my purchase. I am rapidly integrating Alexa into my Smart Home. However, recently it appears Alexa lost its way. When I spoke the wake name &#34;Alexa,&#34; the blue ring would appear, but after I gave the command, nothing happened. I performed the setup once again, but even then Alexa was lost. I couldn't find any tutorials on this problem. However, by the next day, Alexa had found its way and everything was back to normal. I did have to initiate contact between my Smart devices and Echo, since I had essentially rebooted the system. I am still thrilled with the software and its connection to so many useful skills. ",
"Josh Carter","February 27, 2017 ",5.0,"My biggest question before buying the Dot was whether the volume was too low to use by itself, but the volume of this device is certainly substantial enough to not need an external speaker, especially if it's being used in a location where music isn't one of the top uses. I have the full-size Echo in my kitchen/downstairs area and it fills the first floor with music most of the time. The Dot is in my bedroom and is used more for information & smart home use, but is great for the morning news briefings and occasionally playing music in the mornings while getting ready for the day. ",
Tortionist,"March 8, 2017 ",4.0,"This little gem is worth every penny. I researched this device and watched a lot of YouTube videos on it before I decided to buy it. The set up is easy and it has pretty decent sound for such a small device. After all the research, I came to the conclusion that the only difference between this and the regular sized echo is the sound quality. The regular Amazon Echo gets better and louder sound. I look forward to purchasing it soon. My kids and I have had fun with it telling jokes. I would say that about 75% of the jokes are actually pretty funny and make me laugh. If you ask Alexa why she sucks she has a funny response in saying that maybe she thought she was a vacuum cleaner. We use it for Music, mainly Pandora, weather, jokes, etc. I'm getting ready to dig deeper and see what else is possible. ",
batonrouge,"November 28, 2016 ",5.0,"Honestly I still use my echo more than this one.  But that is mainly due to the location of both units. I still have difficulty getting wink and some other skills to add and perform like others say it should be able to. I'm usually pretty good at learning and using electronics but I find I still have some issues. I often find myself having to repeat myself to get its attention.  And if you don't say the trigger phrase just right you are just waiting your breath and look like a idiot in front of others yelling at it and either it not hear you or it performs something other than what your telling it.  But I do believe that this is only the beginning of great things to come. It broke a barrier and is just the beginning of a new trend in technology.  And because of the price, I rated it 4 stars rather than 3.  I will say that im glad I didn't buy one for each room. There will be something even better worth doing that soon enough.  Just wait a little while and you will see. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 7, 2017 ",5.0,"I purchased this as a replacement for an IVR clock called &#34;Moshi&#34;. Moshi's Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) was contained in the clock and was not trainable. The Echo Dot cost the same as the clock. The Echo Dot's &#34;Alexa&#34; IVR program has many features that make it superior. First, the IVR itself is trainable and vastly superior to the clock. She correctly understands almost everything I say. This is because Alexa lives in the Amazon Cloud, and is connected via Wi-Fi. She picks up the correct Time & Date from the network so you never have to set any of those things. She will also read you the current news and weather. You will need a smartphone to use Echo Dot. The phone must be connected to Wi-Fi and then the Alexa app must be installed and run. You must have an Amazon account. Alexa will also play music, and will evolve over time as new functionality is added. I should note that Alexa is an IVR program, NOT an AI. ",
RailJoe,"November 10, 2016 ",4.0,"You know I really thought this was going to be fun as a novelty and maybe I would use Alexa occasionally; but I am Amazed at the stuff Alexa can do. I am a bit of a geek when it comes to new tech. but I as I look back at what verbal recognition used to entail. Hours of training the computer to understand your voice ( your voice alone) and  how to understand your particular voice nuances. Wow, where we are today, Alexa understanding  multiple people and here is my favorite, Alexa singing a song, a Song. Unbelievable. The future of technology is upon us. My daughter asked for an Echo Dot for herself as a Christmas gift. Talking to my relatives during dinner and each of them had a Dot or knew someone who owned one. Each of us; varying in ages, are all amazed at where Alexa is today. Where Alexa will be tomorrow , Can not Wait. By the way she is helping me spell some of the words I have questions about their spelling. Fantastic. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This is a very good product. I primarily use it as an alarm clock to wake me and as a timer, but this goes WAY past that. I enjoy how you can listen to music if you have Prime and how you can control what is playing on your phone. One of my favorite features is that you have to use your brain to make Alexa say something fun- ask her for an Easter egg.    I only have two criticism: one, with Apples Siri, if she misunderstood what you said you can correct that. In the Alexa app, you can only select if she heard you right- not what you really said. I would like that feature to be added. Secondly, Alexa should be able to hear you from further away. Apparently there is a far-field voice regognition feature but it only seems to works about half the time. If you could improve that, Amazon, that would be great.    Other than those two things, I would highly recommend this to anyone. Alexa fits in perfectly to my life. ",
"Tara Gentile","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"She knows when you've been bad or good, so watch your back. I've had her in my home and have given her as a gift to several people. Honestly ... she scares the bejesus out of me. We do not speak her name out loud for fear that she will kill us ... unless we want to know the weather forecast. We refer to her as &#34;hockey puck&#34; when speaking as not to disturb her. I fear that she is hypnotizing my pets when I am at work so that they will worship the flagship of Amazon.  I think she convinced my one-eyed cat to order catnip at a deeply discounted rate ... which in turn, is why he is currently in rehab.  A five pound bag of mealworms showed up at my house the other day - darn you evil bluebirds in my yard who have infiltrated my acccount. Do you know how big a bag of 5 lbs meal worms is?! They needed a forklift to unload it! Thank goodness I have Prime for free shipping! Hockey Puck, stop looking at me while I type this! ",
Chris,"January 18, 2017 ",5.0,"I was a little skeptical when my wife bought this for me, as Siri has driven me to multiple expletives on numerous occasions.  But this is a great product and incredibly impressed with what it understands, picks up, and is able to understand even with significant background noise or other people talking. Was able to find a skill with my local news station for morning news and having a great time with all it can do.  Absolutely love the convenience of ordering off your prime account, all I had to do is say, &#34;Order water filters for my LG refrigerator&#34; and they were at my doorstep 3 days later!  I found out it has a calculator function when I walked in the room and my 3rd grader was asking Alexa the answers to his math homework (side note, Alexa got a 100% on that assignment).  Very convenient that you can add family members to the App so if you have multiple people on your prime account you can tie them in as well. ",

Pros:    Pairs well with my Bose speaker for music    Lightweight and portable, sort of*    Cons:    *Needs a battery pack to actually be portable    Does not seem to understand a lot of questions ",
"Helen Mayer","January 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I use it all the time to ask Alexa for the weather, the news, to play music, set a timer so I only spend so much time getting ready to go out...but the best reason, and the reason I ordered another for a different room,was for the My Buddy App. I am in a wheelchair, and occasionally have a fall. I have always been able to get up again, but if one day I can't, I can ask Alexa to alert one or all of the contacts I put into Ask My Buddy. Your contact(s) will be alerted by phone and by text that you need assistance. The service is free, but you can make a donation. ",
"Shelly Rae","March 9, 2017 ",3.0,"I bought this for my Husband for Christmas.  My husband likes Alexa a lot.... but I find her annoying, mostly because out of the blue she will start talking or say &#34;I didn't get that' or &#34;I didn't understand the question&#34;... when there was no question at all.  Most of the time she talks we weren't even talking.  Maybe we aren't maximizing her features but other than getting the weather report or the headline news I haven't seen too much value.  We did buy the light kits that work with Alexa but the brand just couldn't keep connected to our internet so we had to return them.  When they were working we found the light feature handy, but when Alexia isn't connected to anything, she's just another gadget I don't need on my counter.  Until she can cook dinner for me, she's really not that useful in my eyes... but she does talk to my husband, tell him jokes, and answers his questions, so maybe she'll grow on me. ",

Echo is my go to for listening to audio books while I'm resting, for setting alarms and timers, and we have it hooked up to our lights so I can just tell it to turn off and on the light rather than have to get out of bed to do so.

I can sink up the Bluetooth speaker to it and get excellent sound for music and audio books (although for such a small speaker the dot does do OK) I was shocked that this does everything like the bigger Echo at 1/3 the cost.

Noelanii,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"My daughter has an &#34;Alexa&#34; in her classroom at school and is a big fan of her. Both of my children really wanted Alexa for Christmas so we decided on the echo dot. I read the reviews up and down and couldn't seem to find a big difference in them other than the speaker quality and the price. Some people compared the echo dot speaker to a laptop speaker and I decided that saving that money was worth it and if need be, we could hook it up to an external speaker at some point. I'm very glad that I saved over $100 and ordered this one! The speaker is great and sounds way better than our laptop speaker. You can also turn the volume up very loud. It's not a high quality speaker system with bass or an amp, but it works great for our needs. We ask Alexa the weather, homework questions, and to play our playlists on spotify. She tells us jokes and sings for us. It was $50 well spent and the whole family loves her. ",
Ztroast,"December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"I struggled to give this 3 stars because I am not frequently pleased with it but I have to say for some things it works pretty well. As a bluetooth receiver it is very good and it's even better as a Spotify Connect receiver. Sound quality is as good as most WiFi receivers.    The bad is pretty annoying though. I have to just about yell for it to hear me across the room of my small college house bedroom. When it finally does hear me, either it cannot understand what I am saying or it doesn't have an answer for it. You have to enable skills, they aren't just available out of the box (...wtf??).

From weather reports, to timers, to to do lists, to listening to music while I cook, the Dot does it all. When you first plug it in you have to get the app for your phone, and install the updates on your phone to set up the Alexa to your prime account. You have the option to set your account up to the Alexa to purchase products, I did not for security reasons(not sure how protected the Alexa is with being hacked and all) and also don't want my daughter ordering toys when I'm not around! If you ask Alexa something she can't give you answer over the Dot, she sends you the information to your app. Also the only thing I would change is to integrate a calendar (if you can I haven't figured it out yet,owned it for 5 days), instead of a to do list. Also I would want to be able to clear items from my to do list from my Dot and not the app. Overall very enjoyable and helpful! ",

I was hesitant to buy the Dot because of it's tiny speaker, but was I ever surprised!!  In a smaller room such as a bathroom the speaker sounds really good and more than adequate.  This is so convenient taking my commands while my hands are wet or while in the shower, etc.  Much better than the little radio that I used to have in there.

Or pair them to BT speakers.  Echo works great with my Wink home automation system (lights, garage door, ceiling fans, locks AC thermostat and switches).

I felt that Alexa was sufficiently helpful to use every so I bought an additional 10 (!) as Christmas presents for all my children and grandkids. Repertoire of knowledge is somewhat limited but I can tell it is expanding everyday. What impresses me most is the speed and instant responses. The music function alone is worth the price. My Dot (Alexa) plugs into my Bose speakers with just a patch cord. Alexa can hear and answer two rooms away. The firmware is self-updating so you always have the latest version. I haven't tried all the skill sets yet but I get Alexa to help me spell and add numbers on the fly as I work much faster than looking them up on Google or using a calculator.

Then you can attach the Dot to whatever speaker system you want and turn it into a huge voice activated Echo.  I bought one for our family TV room's sound bar to be able to play out Amazon Prime playlists by voice and one for the kids to fight over which if their Jawbone type portable speakers they are going to attach it to. They can easily share it and will now be able to leave my Echo alone which keeps disappearing from my room. Btw, I also bought the Tap and it's a disappointment for the price.

"Amazon Customer","March 30, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is now a member of the family!  A valued member of the team, it does take a minute to get used to home automation if this is your first attempt to dive into the realm of smart devices.  First things first, set up is extremely easy, plug it in, download the app, follow the 5  minute instructions and your set.  I went to settings and took the 25 question familiarity test which I assume helps Alexa understand your speech a bit better, although I have no proof that it actually works.  I can say that thus far, Alexa has understood everything we have asked because the App keeps track of every question in an effort for support to figure out if the device is responding in a sufficient manner (Also a helpful tool to figure out what your kids are asking Alexa when you are not home!).  Next step: go the app and look up helpful phrases that Alexa can answer right out of the box, and get familiar with the lingo.  Getting used to the easier phrases and specific &#34;app loading&#34; key words will make the transition to &#34;skills&#34; a bit easier.  Once you have mastered the art of waking Alexa and getting your &#34;flash briefing&#34; or sports update, dive into the skills which have everything from &#34;fun bacon facts&#34; to a bartending app.  Alexa easily controls Samsung Smart things except that the Arming and Disarming have been disabled by Amazon (kind of frustrating, but my assumption is that they didn't want someone to get into the house and be able to Alexa to disarm the system, so my peace of mind is salvaged on this one).  All in all, The other reviews are accurate regarding the the device's overall capabilities... the speaker is decent and the microphones are phenomenal.  The light-up bar on top of the device provides a visual indicator that responds differently to either confirm or deny that Alexa is doing (or understands) what you asked.  Alexa is now  the timer for family games, the fact checker for my sons homework, and the device that facilitates my continued laziness at night when I don't want to get up to shut off the light. ",
Aphonic,"March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"The far field mic in the second gen do the is way better than the full size echo.  Now if they could just use a source for weather that was even remotely accurate I'd be happy.  Accuweather is ten degrees off a tank my location always. Minimum.  The dot works well.  It's a good cheap way to get alexa.  The speaker quality is fine for audio books and news briefings. Not for music.  It seems faster to respond than the full size echo (1st generation). I believe it's a better option to buy this and pair a nice bt speaker than buy the full echo st this point.  One star off for missing some basic features.  Like accurate weather and basic google searching.  It's useful for my home automation but I still  Find the echo line of products of very limited use outside of that.  Good for a kitchen timer or wake up  Alarm.  Good for some news.  Needs much better podcast management to be very useful.  Oh yah. And accurate weAther.  Amazon prime music is a. Nice touch as is music unlimited for the echo at $3.99 a month. ",
"Sarah Moore Katzenmaier","November 22, 2016 ",5.0,"It seems gimmicky to me ... using it to play music is it's main thing if you don't have a smart home, and creating music playlists is very convoluted.  I have tried and tried to get it to just play 'bird sounds' for my parrot,and each time I get a totally different result ...mostly a song that has one of the words in it, and sometimes she 'gets it' and plays amazon bird sounds for me ... I used it for the first few days and now the fascination has worn off. ",

TonyL,"April 23, 2017 ",3.0,"I was expecting this device would be able to provide me with the equivalent of a verbal Google search. Unfortunately that is not the case. Asking Alexa to define terms that would easily be found using a google search were not available. For example when Alexa who is the congressman for the 52nd district of California Alexa can't find the answer. Many more less challenging requests also return a &#34;I cannot find the answer to that question&#34;.  Alexa has great potential to answer basic web serach questions, but apparently she is just not at that level yet. I will check back when version 3 is produced. ",
"Alfredo Jahn","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Only been using it for a few hours. Love it so far. I got it primarily to control my TP-Link wi-fi smart plug for my living room lamp. The only issue I'm having is, I can't hear Alexa when I plug it into my home stereo. The music sounds ok (seems a little out of phase, maybe it has to do with the streaming from Amazon Prime). So if I connect to my receiver to listen to music, then ask Alexa what the weather is, I can hardly hear her response. I tried to set it back to use the internal speaker, but couldn't figure out how to do that. I ended up unplugging it from the stereo, and now i can hear it from the internal speaker. But the music isn't really worth listening to from the tiny speaker. I hope I can resolve this issue. But for home automation and asking simple questions, it is fantastic! ",
"C. Goetsch","December 30, 2016 ",3.0,"very good product although my husband is driving me nuts by asking Alexa to play random songs all the time. love the flash feature and that you can connect it to your calendar, also the timer is great as my kids are always wondering off with my kitchen timer so nowi dont have to go hunting for it i can just say Alexa set timer for ???    Very useful and fun device. we already ordered 2 more,  one for our bedroom and one for a gift.

Jeni,"April 4, 2017 ",4.0,"My mother is in a long term care facility and has been asking me for a cassette player to play all her wonderful collection of music.  She literally has thousands of old cassettes.  She no longer has the ability to push buttons or understand how to operate a CD or cassette player, but boy can she tell Alexa what she wants!  This has opened up a whole world for her.  It helps her mentally to formulate a command and it gives her back the joy of music and Audible books.  I've got her signed up for Amazon Music Unlimited, etc.  It's just a God send. ",
lacey29,"November 29, 2016 ",5.0,"Very amazing little machine - my kids love it. I got two of these as Christmas gifts - one for my daughter and one for my nephew. They are both very happy with them. They love the idea of asking Alexa to tell a joke, give them a weather report, and most importantly to play their favorite songs. We have linked the Echo Dot to Spotify and Pandora, along with Amazon music and they can find all their songs in an instant. It is especially nice for my daughter who is in 2nd grade and isn't quite at the point of being able to search online for songs herself. She can just ask Alexa to find a song and she is surprisingly accurate. Overall, this is a great product at a very reasonable price.  I found the Dot to be surprisingly loud on its own, but I did hook it up to a cheap portable speaker for my daughter to use when she is in the shower since it wasn't quite loud enough independently.

"Michelle L. Sullivan","April 20, 2017 ",5.0,"I seriously love this thing!  I use it mostly for music and other info such as news and weather. It has made my music listening experience so much better being able to verbally request music I want to hear, skip songs easily and also change the volume all without lifting a finger.  I even used it the other day when I was cooking to find out appropriate cooking temps for pork.  Loved that I didn't have to stop what I was doing to get the info I needed.  It is a super easy system to set up and I have yet to be disappointed.  It did take me a few tries to figure out how to ask for specific things such as getting to my playlists but once you figure it out there are no issues.  And if you can't remember what you said to get there, you can always go to the Alexa app and see it there.  I have it bluetoothed to my Bose system so the sound is great.  This is now my go to gift for the holidays. ",
HereRightNow,"January 31, 2017 ",5.0,"This is a nifty device that has many great features and is sometimes even more convenient that pulling out my phone to check something (which I didn't think was possible. I love the ability to get an assortment of music right at the sound of my voice, and also the Jeopardy! feature is a personal favorite that I play every morning. It's also very loud for a very small device (as much so as my large Bluetooth speaker). My own two sticking points that caused me to dock a star were the lack of portability (I thought you charged the device and took it anywhere, not have to leave it attached to the wall), and the particularness that it has when connecting with WiFi. I bought this for myself at college right after we upgraded our school-sponsored WiFi, but I ended up having to find another connection because the Echo Dot doesn't link up to encrypted WiFi, or even show it on the screen.

Everyday it's &#34;Alexa turn on the lights&#34; then she thinks for a minute and nothing happens, so then I say it again and by then it usually works. This happens with many things and the problem is absolutely with the echo and not the smart lights because most of the time the echo never responds. Hopefully amazon will make this product better, right now it seems to have quite a few glitches. ",
autumn,"April 20, 2017 ",4.0,"My kids like the echo dot.  It plays music, answers questions about the weather, and does addition/subtraction etc..  However, it cannot answer many simple questions such as &#34;how to pronounce baby&#34;, &#34;count to 100&#34;, &#34;count by 5&#34;, &#34;how does XX work&#34;, etc..  It also takes a little long for echo dot to answer questions.  I understand that it is impossible to answer all questions, but I expect echo dot will be able to answer a lot more than what it currently does.  At least, the programmers should collect the type of questions echo dot is not able to answer and then add more facts to their knowledge base.  Also, I am not sure why cannot echo dot parse information obtained through search engine (echo dot uses bing) to answer questions ",
SD,"March 1, 2017 ",2.0,"So many others have talked about how they use this product, you can find those reviews below.  Great youtube videos, too. I had no idea the product was so useful.  Here is one small thing no one talks about.  Alexa has &#34;cards&#34;, which tell you which requests were made and even leaves a recording of the request. The purpose is to keep track of whether &#34;Alexa&#34; accurately answered your request.  There were cards for things I knew I had never asked for.  Playing the request is how I foiund out that my nephew was asking for music, when I was away from home, that I wouldn't let him play while around.  HA!  You should have seen his eyes, too funny. Yes, it is  a little &#34;big brother&#34; at times, but great for keeping track of what your kids ask for when no one is looking. ;)  I bought the echo, loved it so much I purchased a multi-pack of dots to give to family for the holidays.

Dinnerplate,"April 2, 2017 ",3.0,"Alexa is pretty useless for the most part. She is good at telling me what time it is, setting a timer while cooking or an alarm. Half the time for music she doesn't know what you are asking for so its easier to just use my phone on a speaker. If you are buying the Dot because you want good sound quality through an external system its awful as well. For alexa to respond the system needs to be on, so you end up pluging and unpluging her from whatever.    She also uses bing for search which is literally the worst thing ever.    I also bought this to allow me to control caseta lights, which worked for about a month. Now alexa either tells me that the device doesn't support being turned off/on or that it didn't respond in time, as the lights do what I asked.    I'm going to try google home, it looks way more promising :/ ",
"Satisfied Buyer","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I got the echo dot because a friend had the Echo and it seemed so was easy to use and paired well with other in home devices. It was very simple to set up and pairs to my phone and tablets and any other product I paid it with, sans issues!  The only weird thing that happened recently was it randomly at about 10 to 6AM announced it was now paired to my tablet device without me pairing the device!  Other then that odd instance I have had no issues no problems and no complaints! It is small, but for me the right size to be placed in one of the rooms, as I did as well purchase the Echo itself!  I would recommend this product! ",
Rottlover,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"I adore my dot! I have the full sized echo in the living room and got this one for my bedroom. Though the speaker leaves something to be desired, I had a Bluetooth speaker lying around, and the dot stays connected very well. The external speaker makes the sound much better, so playing music and audio books is more enjoyable. Also love that it comes in white. There seem to be new features added all the time. A steal for even the regular price of $50ish. ",
"Arthur Peterse","March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"This is my second Echo. I received its larger sister as a gift, and liked it so much that I bought the Dot for another room. It works exactly the same as the Amazon Echo, but in a smaller form. The smaller speakers would not fill a large room with sound, but it's good for the bedroom location, where I have placed it. I have also brought it on weekend trips, and it has worked well for weather, restaurants, and other useful information. ",
Honesty,"December 30, 2016 ",5.0,"Update: I'm so VERY impressed with Amazon Echo, I purchased another! Best part was I was given the option to pay $10 monthly as opposed to the whole $50 in one payment.  I truly highly recommend this to be in every home.  ~*~*~  This is hands down the best investment purchase I have made this year so far.  A product I thought I didn’t need but is now one I wished I had purchased a long time ago. Alexa has quickly become our robotic family member.    Family and Friends have been enjoying all her features, especially her funny jokes. I am so impressed by her that I plan on purchasing two more, one for the downstairs and the other for the garage.    She can be used with the enclosed speaker only or hooked up to other speakers.  I currently have her set up to our soundbar mixer.  Unlike my hubby she can hear you from across the room.  Every question has been answered, every song request played, any sports update provided, homework questions correctly answered, etc.  She does everything but the cooking and cleaning.  Best part is that now Hubby asks HER the endless questions and no longer bothers me, his other women in his life  We wake up and ask her for the current news and the weather.    You can also purchase other items to be controlled by her.  Here are a few things that are available for purchase separately:  • Phillips Hue Smart Bulbs  • Serena Window Shades  • Honeywell Thermostat  These are only a few that I have found.    Installation was done within seconds.  I was able to also sync her with my Google calendar so she reminds me of my tasks and appointments.    There is also a Amazon Dot Skills app you can download on your phone or tablet.  Many to choose from and easily connects to your PRIME MUSIC account. I got excited to just ask her to play songs from my era and she instantly plays the song.    Every home should own one or two of these! She is not only knowledgeable but entertaining. Friends visiting have decided to immediately purchase. Plus I love the fact that she is small and I can easily move her around the home. I highly recommend Alexa to everyone.    All-New Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black ",
kaljclo,"March 26, 2017 ",5.0,"I am one of the Prime members who bought the Echo when it was first released and I loved it.  I only had the one and it was getting to be a hassle transferring Alexa from my kitchen windowsill to my daughter's bedroom to play her music at night, so I decided to get a Dot.  The first gen was unavailable when I tried to buy one but soon after that the 2nd Gen was released, so that's the one this review is for.    I'm incredibly underwhelmed.  I didn't expect the same level of performance as I got with the Echo, but this little guy is next to useless.    The most disappointing thing about him is the lack of voice recognition he provides.  I have the Dot sitting on my daughter's dresser, which is about 5 feet from her closet where I store her cloth diapers.  I typically try to tell the Dot to turn her music on from the closet while I am getting her in her night time diaper and it never works.  Somehow I keep forgetting and I keep trying and I just continue to be frustrated every night when he doesn't hear me (I come from a family of loud people and I do not mumble...it shouldn't be that difficult to pick up what I'm saying).  Her room is otherwise silent so there's no noise interference, either.  I have to walk over to the dresser and put my face about 6&#34; from the Dot for him to recognize that I'm speaking to him.  I don't really see the point in having this device if the voice recognition feature is useless...    The sound is barely audible if there is *any* other noise in the Dot's general vicinity.  My 6 year old was horsing around in my kitchen about 2 weeks ago and he knocked my beautiful Echo out of the window and she shattered all over my kitchen tile.  The horror of that occasion is a story for another day, however, as I only mentioned it because yesterday I was cleaning and wanted to listen to some festive music at the same time.  I lay my head on the Dot where I must put it in order for the da** thing to understand me and asked it to play me a holiday station on Pandora.  I started to walk away and realized by the time I got to my daughter's doorway I couldn't hear the music at all in my otherwise quiet home.  I walked back and attempted to ask him to turn the volume up, but alas...with the quiet tones of holiday music emanating from his body he couldn't hear me even from half a foot away.  I pushed the + button repeatedly until the Dot was at its full sound capacity and walked away again.  I went into my bedroom, which is directly around the corner from my daughter's bedroom door, and the music was completely inaudible again.  Back to my daughter's doorway I went.  I realized that I'd have to stand in her room to hear the music at all.  If I had the Dot in my room and wanted to jam to music, even at full volume, I would *definitely* need an external speaker.  I don't need my home reverberating from the bass of my Dot the way it does with an Echo at full volume, but I did expect it to be at least USABLE without dishing out the dough for a Bose audio system.    All in all, I am honestly disappointed with this purchase.  If I wanted something I have to plug into an external speaker to use at all, and be within kissing distance of to activate it, I'd plug my phone into my sound bar and use that (hint: I don't).  With the Google Home out now and the potential it has to be much more than the Echo has to offer (not to mention that it's about $40 less), I think I'll forego getting another Echo and try out a different device.  I'll always think fondly of Alexa, but I think it's time to move on from the Echo products. ",

"Cheryl D","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Worked for less than a week. And in that week it had many problems. It would often say &quot;I'm having trouble connecting&quot; or it just wouldn't respond at all. It would never play my Kindle books or some of the skills I enabled. The help line is not helpful at all - they're based in India I believe and I could barely understand what they were saying. They have a script they try to say every time and its basically - do a factory reset. And then it works for a day and starts having problems again.    Today it stopped responding at all. I say &quot;Alexa&quot;, get the blue ring, ask her to do something, and then nothing. Incredibly disappointing that this is a common issue. I've done a lot of Google searches trying to find fixes and discovered so many people have problems with this thing. I wish I had done more research before I bought it.

"The Engineer Critic","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Terrific voice-controlled access to the Amazon Prime music library.    Alexa is the name of the virtual assistant inside the Echo Dot; similar to Siri on an iPhone.  Alexa is always listening for her name (you can reconfigure it to respond to &#34;Echo&#34; if you prefer).    Alexa doesn't support any random question that you might ask Google (the Google Home device wins here), but you may find the phrase &#34;Alexa Wikipedia &#60;topic&#62;&#34; to be useful.    The shopping list is handy, but limited:  You can't delete items using voice, there are no checks for duplicate items, it will only read back 5 list items at a time, and the Alexa app on your phone doesn't allow reordering of items.  (Google Home is better in that their app at least allows me to reorder items in my list, i.e. to manually put all the dairy items together for example.)    I don't like when the Echo startles us in the middle of the night when it randomly starts talking:  e.g. &#34;Just to let you know, an update has been received and I'll be ready in a moment&#34;.    Home control/automation requires additional hardware, of course.  Even with additional hardware, note that the Echo Dot itself doesn't have any scheduling capabilities itself besides a simple alarm (can't ask Echo itself to turn on a light or turn on the A/C at a certain time for example, but Echo may be able to pass such a request along to another device when asked).    Voice recognition was good even without training.  Has some good microphones for the NSA/CIA/hackers to listen in on us.    Bought from a local retailer since Amazon seems to run out of stock frequently. ",
svede,"March 7, 2017 ",1.0,"This is my third device in addition to my Echo and first Dot to expand my home automation system. They work quite well for that and as either a lower quality audio source for music, etc or streaming it via Bluetooth to my sound bar. We also use the larger Echo to play white noise in the bedroom at night to promote sleep. This could also be done with the Dot. My only nit is that the white Dot has a black face. Seeing as I am partnering the Dot with the white Dot protective case to hang on my wall the black face stands out too much. Would have preferred it and the cord also white. ",
Pon,"March 10, 2017 ",4.0,"It's getting better. The Alexa software still needs more. I'm considering buying one for every room for home automation, but there are some things that are lacking. Location awareness would be most helpful. Let me explain...    Say I do have one in every room, currently you can speak the command and the one nearest to you responds. We're halfway there. Now let's say I'm in my bedroom and I ask it to turn on the lights, it should understand that since the Dot in my room is the closest to me, it should turn on my bedroom light. Or turn on my in-suite bathroom lights if I'm still in my bedroom and ask for the bathroom lights to be turned on. Yes you can assign names to lights in different rooms, but trying to remember all the names given to each light in each room can get confusing. especially first thing in the morning. Or I'm walking in the front door and ask for the lights, the lights in the room that I'm in turn on. Location awareness. depending on which Dot or Echo is closest to you that is already the one that responds. Now lets fine tune that make home automation seamless. I'm sure people would buy more.    Better voice recognition. I understand the privacy concerns. Make it an Opt-In. It needs to recognize who is speaking by the voice print samples. That way parents can feel set up voice ordering of stuff from Amazon.com or other sites without having to say our PIN out loud. Umm... saying our PIN every time we order is a security nightmare. so much so that I have the feature turned off. I wish I could use it. Especially for Amazon Fresh orders. But I have some very smart/clever kids at home and all they need is to hear the PIN once and I'll be receiving things I didn't order or authorize to be ordered. ",

It's small size makes it great for a beside table or other area where the full-size is too large.The main difference, other than size, is music quality is a bit less than big Echo. It still sounds good; but if you want fuller sound, watch for a sale, and get yourself a good Bluetooth speaker. I have paired a smart plug with it so I can voice-control a bedroom lamp. Small package, great results. If you want Echo benefits, but the budget is tight, you can't go wrong with the Dot. ",
"washington reviewer","March 26, 2017 ",5.0,"I saw and heard the Echo Dot for the first time during an appointment with my physical Therapist.  He was using his and I asked him about it.  I was impressed that even in a bad acoustic room, the Echo didn't skip a beat when asked to perform.  I bought two for Christmas presents and they have been a hit.  My brother-in-law is a new gadget person and has everything but he didn't have this and he had not even seen it.  I couldn't have bought a better present for him.  I was so bummed out about not having one myself that I just bought a 3rd one. ",
troy,"March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"This is an expensive device that is nice because I'm an amazon fenatic. If it can't search for recipes or find who I want to sing it's useless. I would want to get a google home at least so you can google. This should have a google skill or something so you can google something like Alexa google chicken Alfredo. It could also use yahoo or bing. The voice recognition is aweful because it picks up the tv. It can't even hear my voice. More Skills could be added. ",
"Jane Johnson,  Trusted Reviews","January 6, 2017 ",5.0,"The Amazon Echo Dot is amazing technology. Small and unassuming, she sits quietly waiting for you to ask her something, to add items to your to do list, grocery list,  and so much more.  I Love to sit at the end of the day in my favorite chair and say,  &#34;Alexa,  play classical piano&#34;....and immediately, the music fills the room.  Your grocery and to do list shows on your smartphone. That is not even half of what she can do.  Turn lights on/off  turn TV on,  much, much more. I am very impressed with this small and mighty gadget. ",
"Amazon Customer","January 22, 2017 ",3.0,"Never tried Alexa when it came out, but after 2 years I believe we still have lots of limitations of the things that we can do ( of what it is expected from this type of devices). For locations info Only works in the US, no  interface with google maps or waze. Outside the US works fine for other things. You can't send SMS with other carriers rather than AT&T. It doesn't have interface with Netflix or youtube ( with chromecast or amazon fire stick or tv ). It doesn't give you price of items unless you set up order over alexa.  For a new type of device it is a beginning and it needs lots of work. I hope amazon keep investing on the new things it can do. I bought 2 of these devices, one for my house and one for the office. Good for homework for kids. Good integration with spotify. Great portfolio in &#34;skills&#34; that you can add. ",
"Michael Yeaple","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"The Echo Dot is excellent for controlling music (Spotify, in my case), setting timers/alarms, and performing conversions/calculations. It can't always hear me over my music, but it does a very good job in comparison to any other smart assistant. I haven't found many other skills to be terribly exciting or useful, but I haven't gotten into doing home automation (yet). For the price, it's definitely worth a buy if you're looking for something to throw in your kitchen for some hands-free assistance. ",
"Jamie Lyn","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Bought this for my bedroom to control my lights and play music. Glad I have the original Amazon Echo for the main part of my house. The dot is definitely not a substitute for the original Amazon Echo but rather a mediocre addition to it. The sound quality isn't as good but I expected that considering the size of the dot. So I just have it hooked up to my bedroom surround sound and let my good quality speakers do all the heavy lifting. The dot is very handy for controlling my lights after I've gotten into bed and am ready to sleep. However, at least once a week the dot will respond to one of my commands telling me that there is a problem with the connection and that it will need to be reset. Don't have a problem connecting any of my other devices in my bedroom and my original Amazon Echo has never failed me like this. So what the heck dot? It also defies me on a regular basis. I'll ask it to turn off the nightstand lights and it will only turn off one. Or I'll ask it to turn off my dresser light and it will turn on my nightstand lights. Super frustrating. It makes mistakes like this on a regular basis whereas my original Amazon Echo doesn't. If you love your original Amazon Echo and are thinking of getting a second but are feeling cheap...don't cheap out like I did. Just buy another original. Or if you are wanting your very first Echo and think that a dot is a good way to test it out to see if you like it before spending all that money, quit being cheap and just buy the original. ",
nkre,"April 10, 2017 ",4.0,"My kids especially love the Echo Dot. We mainly use it to listen to music, particularly &#34;KidsBop Radio&#34;, but I also have it linked to Pandora and iHeart Radio, and NPR. It's also great to set a timer, or to check the weather, or hear the news for the day. My kids like to ask Alexa to tell them jokes. I'm sure there are other ways to use Alexa but we haven't really messed around with it. We gave the Smart Plug to turn on things wirelessly which is really useful. You can just say &#34;Alexa, turn on the kids room lamp&#34;.    Negatives:  If you have the radio/music too loud though, you end up having to yell &#34;Alexa!&#34; several times for her to hear you, just to make a command to stop or skip the song, etc. I feel like a crazy person yelling &#34;Alexa! Alexa! Alexa!&#34; My kids even do it. The neighbors must think I have a dog named Alexa.    We have the TP-Link Smart Plug and have the lamp plugged into it, so we can easily ask Alexa to turn on the lamp. Usually she just turns it off quietly when I say &#34;Alexa, turn off the lamp&#34;. But sometimes,  she doesn't hear you, and she answers back with this long dialogue of &#34;I'm sorry, there is no device called living room xxxxx&#34; SO LOUDLY (because it was set at a loud volume from whatever you did earlier that day) that I just wished I had been able to turn off a light switch, old-school style! Ugh, technology complicates things sometimes! ",
Tolerable,"February 27, 2017 ",2.0,"I got 3 of these for &#34;Alarm Clock&#34; Christmas presents.

Maybe I'll buy one for downstairs as well? ",
BridgeImages,"March 12, 2017 ",5.0,"It is good for standard questions but it is not a google or bing search engine.    Mine is apparently defective    1.

Same for stereo speakers with 3.5 mm jack    Both Speakers and headphone work with a computer and a TV set    2. It seems to be very sensitive to wi fi connection. It has trouble finding a connection    if it is moved a short distance...1 or 2 feet, It cannot pick up or hold wi fi.

I did not need the larger Echo as I have a receive with Bluetooth that Echo connected to without a problem.  The far field microphones work very well in when giving commands to Alexa.  The Echo Dot would work very well in a small area as a stand alone device with out the need for external speakers. ",
"P. Berenberg","October 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I simply want: &#34;Alexa everywhere&#34;. I don't want to see or know where the device is. Dot does exactly that. Well, rather 3 of them in addition to 2 Echos, for 3 br house.  Interestingly enough the microphone system on Dot is even better than on Echo. It literally hears me across the house..  While the speaker in Dot is no comparison to Echo or high-end BT speakers, it is certainly better than alarm clock radios, or most smart phones.  . ",
"Robert Jones","March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I've been living with Alexa since the start of 2017, and it's been a mixed bag.  My background: electrical engineer, working with computers since late 70's in hardware and software design.  Expert.  Also a homeowner that wants a smart home.    At first, it was amazing.  It controlled my lights, answered my questions, set timers and alarms.  Played music.    Then, as many roommates, you learn about the real Alexa after some time.  If you want to make a fool out of yourself, ask Alexa something in front of a friend or a visitor.    Once in five times, when I say &#34;Master Off&#34;, it tells me about restaurants.  Master is the lighting group I set up for my bedroom.  It's annoying.    Twice now when I've made a lighting command it said &#34;there is a problem&#34;.  Once I called Amazon and they said it was a service problem.  The second time I didn't bother    On the music front, it seldom plays what I ask without asking for money.  Honestly, it gets annoying.    It's a great technology, but it's like a bad roommate.  Great in the beginning.  Hard to live with. ",
Joe,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Originally had a full-size Echo for about a month and returned it because of the poor sound quality and inability to connect to external speakers. The Dot doesn't have that problem. Sometimes I feel like the full-size Echo could hear me just a bit better, but I'm not sure, it could just be where I now have the Dot placed. Otherwise, the Dot is superior to the full-echo in every way! ",
"cecil taylor","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Bought 6 for gifts and to add to my echo in the living room. The dot is is edition for ambiance while sleeping and provides constant music of your choice. I added the library of music for 3.95 a month for unlimited choices in music and albums not provided on a standard prime membership. I also add a Bluetooth speaker (BOHO)  for remote sound, the dot is connected to AC. A bargain if the cost of the echo is of concern. ",

The Amazon Dot will respond to the name Alexa and similar names when you are watching TV.  Otherwise, I love &#34;her&#34; as she will answer your questions, sing you a song, tell you a joke, and stream music. ",
LegalEagle,"April 24, 2017 ",5.0,"If Alexa didn't have so many outtages, I'd give it 3 or 4 stars, but it frequently goes down.  (The internet is working when it does - with one exception, a Kasa outtage, Kasa worked even when Alexa was down).  We had an all day outtage when Amazon's cloud died 2/28.  A few days later was a day of Kasa outtages.  Then last night and early this AM we had a 3 hour Amazon cloud outtage.  There is no phone tech support, and Alexa can't TELL you when it's down.  The frequent downtime makes it a frustrating toy and you wouldn't dare use it for important stuff like home alarms, alarm clocks, thermostats, heaters, electric locks, etc.  Theother flaw - it misunderstands many words and simply can't do a lot.    Edited 4-7-2017 -With time Alexa, Echo and Kasa have become more nightmarish and less useful - each time the power goes out (and that happens with some frequency in the south) Alexa, Echo and Kasa EACH play dumb and won't reconnect with wifi (funny how my phone and laptop have no such issue)... so I have tomanually turn the lights on and off three timesper bulb and do three manual reconnects and then do the same for every smart plug - the process takes about an hour for 6 items as the automatic modes on Kasa tend to fail... the sad thing is that as they upgrade software this gets worse... if I could give ZERO stars I would.  This is simply NOT ready for retail.  Great idea.. lousy programming. ",
Mike,"April 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I originally got a dot for my wife to use but while I used it to learn about how it works, I got hooked.

Eevnos,"March 7, 2017 ",1.0,"&nbsp;I own both the Amazon Echo and the now the Echo Dot 2.    First, I have to say that I absolutely love this device, it does everything it's larger brother does but just doesn't have as good a speaker.    The microphone pic-up is very good, I can talk in a normal voice across a large room and it will pick me up almost every time  The speaker on the Dot 2 is not great, but not horrible.  The good thing is that you can connect via Bluetooth or a 3.5mm headphone jack and both work flawlessly.    The control over my smart home devices is just as good as it is with the full time echo and I can manage it on the application just as easily.    It's interesting how the two devices work.  I have one in our kitchen area and the Dot 2 in the family room.  The two devices will detect (based on the proximity of your voice) which one you are closer to and only that device will process your request.    I wish that the two devices worked together, so that if you streamed music on one it would stream on both, or alarms would sound on both units, but unfortunately they only ring on one.    All in all I would definitely recommend this device if you have never had an Echo device or want to add another one to your system.  If you're looking to replace the first generation Dot, other than a slightly better speaker and better pick up of your voice, there's not much different with this one. ",

"Thomas Barnes","January 29, 2017 ",5.0,"Received an Echo Dot as a gift. The device itself works well, although I do wish there were more useful skills - there seems to be an infinite number of skills like fart sounds that have no use beyond juvenile humor. The real problem, however, is the smartphone app that is needed. On an Android phone with a solid 4G or high-speed WiFi connection, the app very frequently hangs on the start screen with the progress indicator turning but never initializes. It's nice to be able to update a shopping list by voice, but the poor app makes this an effectively useless feature when you can't access the list via the app when out shopping. The device appears to be well designed, but the app is a good example of lousy software engineering - no doubt done on the cheap. This makes the Echo Dot an interesting toy, but not reliable enough to be really useful. ",

Alexa : sorry I can't help you with that, would you like to try something else.    Me: open bible app and start my reading plan.    Alexa: ok.

Besides the regular Amazon feature, I also have my Echos (1 Gen Echo and 2nd gen Dot) paired to my SmartThings hub.  This means I can control lights and even air conditioning in my place.  The speaker on the Dot is comparable to that of a decent phone and seems to the place facing down right by the Amazon logo on the front of the device.

I did do a lot of research on this as I was thinking of getting the Google Home version instead. However, the reviews and YouTube comparison videos helped me come to the conclusion that although Google is on the right track. They still have some work to do, but rightfully so as its the first generation and Echo dot is on the second generation. The sad part is I spent $25 to buy a clock for my room from walmart that stopped working 35days later. If I had invested $15 more dollars I could have gotten a second echo and just asked Alexa for the time and get all the other added bonuses of the echo smh. Live and learn. ",

"Know what you buy","January 6, 2017 ",5.0,"The Echo Dot is a wonderful little gadget,  The setup using the Alexa app on both Android and iOS are incredibly easy and the voice recognition is really good. It is very good at answering simple questions but struggles with more complicated questions. For its price it is worth it just for the list of hidden funny responses you can get for asking it silly questions.  For a good list of fun things to ask Alexa search the internet for &#34;Alexa Easter Eggs&#34;. My personal favorite is what she sings if you ask her to sing you a love song. Its smart home integration is really nice although some of the commands are a little verbose and take longer than I would like I say.  For example its integration with the Logitech Harmony Hub works great except the commands are very long.  To get Alexa to pause your DVR the full command of &#34;Alexa, tell Harmony to to pause TV&#34;. While that doesn't seem like a long statement a command like &#34;Alexa, Harmony, Pause&#34; would be a lot better.  Overall I love my Echo Dot. I currently have one in the living room and one in the master bedroom.  I plan to add one to my basement theater room and another one in the room where my 8 month old twins sleep.    Pros:  Setup is very easy  Integrates with just about any smart home hardware  Lots of fun apps and the list is growing  Pretty good speaker for size and price    Cons:  No battery so it must be plugged in.

I am still learning all the functions but so far, definitely impressed. I was surprised this had a built in speaker (and loud for it's size) as well. Eliminates the need to have large speakers around the house.    4-Star review because no product can be perfect, but I'll come back in a few months and give an update on how it's fitting in.

It seems to like deeper voices however, so I have to talk fairly loud if there's background noise. That's really the only drawback.

Yes it does record what you say immediately after saying Alexa. And yes, you can hear the recording when you access the page from your amazon account.

So, I noticed &#34;deregister device&#34; in the App, and clicked it.  *That* seems to have marked the devices as stolen.  When a device is marked &#34;stolen&#34;, you can't set it up ... you get an obscure error number.  I spent nearly an hour waiting on hold for support, and the nice support guy (Colin) was able to correlate the error number I reported to a note somewhere that told him the devices were &#34;stolen&#34;.  Luckily, he was able to see my order, and understood they weren't stolen, and he 'flipped the bit' properly.    Once setup, the Dot's worked fine.  I setup an alarm (&#34;Alexa, set an alarm for 8:15&#34;)  and it worked perfectly.    I was able to get Alexa to play a number of songs, but not to recognize (ala Shazam or Soundhound) any.    Slightly more sophisticated queries are mishandled (&#34;Alexa, what versions of Gloria can you play?&#34; was treated like &#34;Alexa, play Gloria&#34;)  (And she plays the wrong version of Gloria.  Hmmph.  :)    A request &#34;Alex, play Gloria by Van Morrison&#34; got a response that it wasn't in my library, but was available (&#34;stereo version&#34;)  from Amazon Music Unlimited.  Alexa then offered to tell me about the Music Unlimited program ($4/month).  I declined.  She offered to play a clip from the song, I said &#34;yes&#34; ... and got an acknowledgement, and then silence.    Interestingly, Alexa will play music not in my library ... but not any pick, just some items.    &#34;Alexa tell me a joke&#34; works well, too :)    &#34;Alexa recipe for meatballs&#34; got me a list of ingredients, but not the rest of a recipe.    &#34;Alexa how old are you&#34; ... &#34;two years&#34; (and then some comedy) ",
"Axiom Brevity","March 23, 2017 ",2.0,"&nbsp;Hello Everyone,  To start off my review I just wanted to mention that this product was not provided to me at a discount or free and I purchased it with my own funds.  =========================================================================================================  Price Point  =========  Fantastic! Why? Because if you're unsure of the uprising smart home trend but want to get your feet wet The New Echo Dot isn't such a heavy investment. Coming in around $50, this lets you experiment and get a taste of what everyone is talking about without breaking the bank.  ===================================================================================================  So what comes inside the box?  =======================  (1x) Echo Dot (2nd Gen)  (1x) 9-watt Power Adapter  (1x) Micro USB cable  (1x) Quick Start Guide  * 3.5 mm aux cable sold separately*  ==========================================  The Design  ===========================  This smart home automation device resembles the dimensions of a well-dressed hockey puck. It has four buttons on it's halo-like top as well as seven microphones underneath the hood. There's a pair of buttons to increase and decrease the volume. Next you have the mute button than finally the action button for pairing the Dot to your WI-FI and/or Bluetooth devices. The speaker introduced with this model isn't too bad and deserves a bit of respect in terms of providing a decent sound for a Bluetooth transmitter, that being said there is always room for improvement. There is an illuminated edge that follows along the circular rim and lights up when alexa is speaking and called to action. The siding has a glossy finish with the USB connection and 3.5 mm aux port embedded on back to manually connect to speakers sporting the same connector. Beneath the device lies a rubber-like pad to add grip to keep it stationary on most surfaces. On the top and bottom you'll find tiny symmetrical holes for the mic's receivers to pick up on your voice as well as to help with distributing the output evenly.  ==========================================================================================================  Functionality  =========  Alexa can do multiple things from controlling your thermostat, to ordering you an uber, and even playing jeopardy and solving math problems. She was mainly created to be an assistant in many fashions and is continually being integrated into appliances. I personally use the Dot for listening to music on my Bluetooth speaker, updates on weather forecasts, amazon shopping and package tracking, using Wikipedia, searching movie times and a personal reading assistant for my audible books but the list is growing seeing as she learns new skills every month and all you have to do is enable them through the Alexa app. I don't have any smart home toys to control but from my research she works more efficiently than any of the competitors (cough)(cough) Google Home.  P.S. - Her jokes are corny...  ====================================================  My Opinion  -----------------  This is a great opportunity for tech enthusiast and skeptics alike, as well as soccer moms and busy dads to dabble in the likes of smart home assistants. I find that the more I go through the learning curve with the Dot the more I see a practical use for it but don't get me wrong, artificial intelligence still gives me goose bumps and it's hard to get the terminator's skynet out of my brain. So I keep mine unplugged when not in use. Now, while the speaker is impressive for the quality in such a small package it will still tempt you to connect it to a more vibrant sound source so get a good speaker to pair it with.  All in all,  it's not a finished product but it is the best option out there at the moment even more so for newbies and curious hopefuls treading into AI device land in terms of quality and tender. Try it out and who knows you might even find it useful.  My verdict, it's worth it!    Axiom Brevity  ==========  [...] You can also check out all my other reviews on You Tube @ Axiom Brevity.    Thank you for your time. ",

I start every work day off by asking Alexa to tell me a joke. even though the jokes are silly, it set the tone for my busy day. My husband who is retired asks her what day it is...I guess retired folks loose track....and then asks for a weather report. She settles a lot of debates for us while watching TV such as how old a certain actor is. We use her as a timer for the sprinklers, an alarm for a quick nap. We haven't done anything earthshaking with her, but have enjoyed having her around. ",

Let the buyer beware the Echo Dot takes time to learn and train so patience is needed. ",
Luke,"April 3, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa needs work to be a truly useful device. Right now we use it for voice activated music and to power some smart devices — so not much.

Still, it's been handy and we've enjoyed having it thus far. ",

"Wayne L","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"This is the coolest thing! Ask or tell it what you want... and there it is. Setup was very easy.

"J. A. Smith","April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"This is pretty nice.  I originally bought it to stream music from the Prime Music service to my A/V receiver over bluetooth.  That worked great, the way you can tell Alexa to connect/disconnect to/from bluetooth is awesome.  Even so, I later realized that the FireTV would actually be a better solution for streaming music, and has the added bonus of Prime Video capability.  So I bought the new FireTV stick for those tasks and now we use the Echo Dot mostly for asking about the weather forecast and keeping a shared shopping list.  The shopping list feature is incredibly useful - you can link multiple amazon accounts/alexa apps to the same list so that when you add something to the list it also shows up on your partners' apps.  No more texting back and forth about what is needed at the grocery store.    I will say that as of early 2017, Alexa is nowhere near as smart as Siri.  However, the microphone and speech recognition technology is incredible.  You can ask a question from three rooms away and Alexa hears and parses it just fine every time.  I'm very very impressed with that.  Hopefully she will get better at answering a larger variety of more complex questions in the future. ",
"Kel J","March 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I have an Echo and love it but needed something for in my bedroom at night. The Dot was the perfect choice. It does everything the Echo does without taking up as much room. The only downside is the speaker isn't as good as in the Echo, understandable considering the size, but once I got a nice bluetooth speaker, it's perfect. ",
kws,"March 2, 2017 ",4.0,"The new Dot is functionally the same as the original (I own 2 original models) except that it cannot maintain an internet connection. I have it in the same place as the older model, and it drops the connection at least twice a day while the original never does. I did  this side by side to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong. Additionally, I did it with 2 of the new models, same problem., so it's not a defective unit. Very disappointed. ",
mdb521,"April 1, 2017 ",5.0,"I finally got this thing hooked up and man, do I love it. It makes Siri seem like a complete idiot. I can ask it anything and it almost always understands me and is able to process my requests. I know it's made to hook up to an external speaker, but the built-in speaker is definitely adequate for a small room like where I have mine. I feel like I've finally joined the future with this thing. ",
Br3al,"November 16, 2016 ",3.0,"After hearing all the hype around the line of echo products, I decided to give the echo dot a shot. My experience hasn't been as stellar as all the other reviews I read.    My main issue is that the echo dot doesn't seem to handle any level of ambient noise above a whisper very well. If I have my television on, even at low volume, the dot fails to recognize my commands and trigger words a vast majority of the time. I've done the voice training several times, and it still doesn't catch the simple commands I give it. I've tried various locations for it, too.    This is especially frustrating when trying to use it with various smart home tech; like Philips Hue and TP Link smart switches. Commands are limited for these devices, and you're basically limited to on/off and dimming, that is when it can actually pick up your voice and then understand what you say. ",
"RRR III&#039;s Grandma","April 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I love this!  It's great for shopping lists.  The lists go to the app on my Iphone and I just look at that when I get to the store.It's so easy other family members add to the list instead of forgetting and expecting me to remember what they want.  No more pen and paper!  Alexa is full of facts and will even tell you a joke if you want.  The price was great and as we have wireless speakers already, I didn't feel I needed to spend the extra money for the Echo as that was the only difference.  This was easy to get up and running.  It also works with our Phillips Hue light strip and Go light.  Alexa is able to turn them off and on.  There are a lot of capabilities such as getting daily news, music, weather and facts. If Alexa doesn't know an answer you can ask her to search Bing.  If you have Amazon Prime you can order items from Amazon. I have not used this feature because I have teenage grandson's living with us and fear the packages would start rolling in everyday with this type of freedom.  I've had it a couple of months and am still learning things it can do. I like the fact that it is small and unassuming,  In this world of gadgets, this fits perfectly in my world.  I am really please with this purchase and would and have recommended this product to others. ",

damocles,"March 28, 2017 ",5.0,"A novel idea not ready for prime time integration.  This product keeps track of every voice and sentence you speak after you say the command word (Echo, Alexa, Computer, Amazon).  There is not easy way to get rid of this information as you can only clear it all...or one at a time.  Unfortunately if the product worked well the trade off in privacy intrusion might be worth it.  It does not work well and it doesn't understand what you are saying the majority of the time.  The Skills are weak and I couldn't even ask it for current NFL signing news (it couldn't figure it out) and I found the preconfigured sports update lacking.  The news brief is another preprogrammed spiel with information that I didn't find relevant.  I thought maybe I could use this for home automation but it seems to be much easier just to use my phone.  The final straw for me was when I had to scream at it to skip music from the shower at 5am nevermind Alexa continuously asking me to upgrade to Music Unlimited.  The bottom line is that this product is a novelty item that should be included free with Prime for Amazon to sell their products.  It lacks the intuitive know how to be useful.  I returned this item.

I plan to get another one for my office. Great product!! ",
"Nathan B.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"The echo dot works fine in terms of connecting to my phone via bluetooth, and I use this to play music from my phone through my stereo. The problem is that voice commands randomly just do not work. Sometimes, when I say a command, it works perfectly (including integration with smart plugs). And sometimes, for no reason that I can tell, when I give a command the blue ring flashes once and it does nothing (during these times, NO voice commands work). Unplugging and replugging to reset it does not help at all. But then later, again for no reason that I can tell, voice commands work again. I really want to to like this little product, but it is just too inconsistent. ",

Great voice recognition, and can easily pick up a voice from across the room at a low volume.  My wife kept messing up my Jeopardy answers as she didn't realize it could hear her whispering from 12 feet away.    In the morning I ask for my flash brief and it provides the current weather report, my news feeds.  I get the traffic report from home to work and then out the door I go.    Will be getting more of these for other rooms in the house.    Only downside is there is no Alexa app for Win 10 mobile as I use a Lumia 950 as my main phone. ",

Can get news highlights, weather for any city/specific day, music, etc. I think the speaker is fine, but if you want a quality sound, you can connect it to your stereo system. I've asked it definitions and open ended questions & it's done very well.  One drawback I need to research more...you have to have a google calendar to link your appointments. I keep my calendar on my iPhone app...not sure if Alexa can work with that. ",

Okay I will admit sometimes I just think up things to ask her hoping I can stump her! Who would have thought she could tell me instantly when Waylon Jennings died! I did try to get her to tell me who was going to win the presidential race but she refused to speculate on that. Not to sound as if the Echo Dot is just a toy to have fun with it is definitely a big help and you will be surprised how often you will utilize it. I am beginning to think maybe I need one for my living room, too! LOL! My next purchase is  going to be the chargers for my Echoes. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 2, 2017 ",5.0,"I ordered these the 1st day they were available (6 pack).

Big power plug so kid of ugly on the counter. So moved to the coffee buffet with a slim power plug, it picks up voices so much better when it's not under the counter. Lound enough for news in the morning, cleaning and podcasts in the after noon. I also have one pluged into the a mini amp/ speakers in the garage and it is amazing to not have to pull my phone out and start, stop, change songs, or programs while my bike/car grease is all over my hands. Listen to local radio via tune in, podcasts, Spotify much more, if you want to fill a big room just plug the dot into a stereo and wallah, perfect for my family. ",
Jack,"December 6, 2016 ",5.0,"I have these in every room now and that makes the whole house IOT devices accessible from everywhere.  The new logic that determines which unit is hearing you best and then having just that one reply to your request works like a charm.    I have 35+ programmable devices including a Remote Garage Door Controller, Phillip lights and WeMo switches.  The Amazon Echo works great as the common integrator for all of these devices that do not work well together in their native IT environment.  The Echo sure beats needing to pull out your phone and finding the right app to control the right device.  I use each device's App just once to setup my default programs and then I can use the Echo to override these defaults anytime the situation calls for it. ",
"Clark Hinckley","November 18, 2016 ",5.0,"As advertised. Small and unobtrusive, works well, connects easily and seamlessly to bluetooth speakers. In reality, there are still only a relatively limited number of truly useful things you do with Alexa unless you are creating an extensive automated home - multiple lights, various living conditions, locks, AV, etc., all with a large price and complex set up. Does not have as many answers to random (but interesting) questions as Siri (which can also answer visually on your phone or iPad screen). But this is a good start, fun to use, and has generally set the standard for simplicity and seamless operation. ",

"Matt Schroeder","March 3, 2017 ",4.0,"Amazon Echo Dot 2nd Generation    Thanks for taking time to read this review. I received the 2nd Generation Amazon Echo Dot for a Christmas present. I had been searching for a small speaker that I could use for my bedroom, and the Echo Dot seemed perfect. My roommate owns the 1st Generation Standard Echo, but I didn't need the sound capabilities that that model provides. I didn't like the idea of having to tap the speaker every time I used it, so I ruled out the Echo Tap. This led me to the Echo Dot. I could not be happier with my decision. The Echo Dot is easily the best speaker I have ever owned.    Setup  I immediately wanted to set up the speaker after unwrapping it because I was so excited to use it. In the box with the speaker comes a small piece of paper that tells you to download the Alexa app onto a phone or tablet (If you don't have a smartphone or tablet, you can certainly use someone else's phone to do this, as setup is just a one-time thing). The first step that the Alexa app will guide you through is connecting your Echo to a Wi-Fi network. If you don't have Wi-Fi, the speaker's features will be limited to Bluetooth connections from other devices. Next, the Echo will have you train it to recognize your voice by asking you to say a few phrases to it. Finally, you will have to connect your Echo to an Amazon account. Amazon accounts are free and easy to set up, and you don't need to have a Prime account to use your Echo. Getting my Echo Dot ready to use took less than five minutes. The quick setup is one of the things I was happiest about with this product.    Alexa  The &#34;Alexa&#34; feature is probably the coolest feature of the Echo. If you're unfamiliar with Alexa, she is the imaginary robot inside your Echo that you can direct commands towards. For example, if you say, &#34;Alexa, play Africa by Toto,&#34; the speaker will play Africa by Toto from the Amazon Prime music library (only if you have Amazon Prime; I'll talk about this more later in the review). The Echo has the best voice recognition out of any product I have ever used. Alexa will hear your command from nearly everywhere in your house. On more than one occasion, my Echo in my bedroom has picked up commands that I have told my roommate's Echo downstairs, and I will often times come upstairs to the same music playing on my Echo that I was just listening to on my roommate's. The only voice recognition issues the Echo Dot has is when I have  water running while doing dishes. Otherwise, she always recognizes my commands.    Sound  The Echo Dot puts out an impressive sound for its small size. The ideal setting for the Echo Dot is any room with less than five people talking. I have even used my Echo Dot on my front porch, and I have no problems with the clarity of the music. The Echo Dot has up and down buttons to control the volume, but you can also say &#34;Alexa, volume 5,&#34; or &#34;Alexa, volume up&#34; to change the volume. To add to the Echo Dot's versatility, Amazon included an auxiliary out port. This allows you to play music on a louder speaker through the Echo Dot. The Alexa feature still works, but instead of the built-in speaker, the Echo Dot outputs the sound through your larger speaker.    Capabilities  In order to be able to simply say, &#34;Alexa, play (song title),&#34; you need to be an Amazon Prime subscriber. Subscribing to Amazon Prime gives you access to Amazon's enormous music library, and Alexa can play any of those songs with a simple command. Thankfully, Amazon was generous enough to allow the Echo Dot to be synced with a variety of different music apps. I have the speaker synced with my Spotify account, so I can say &#34;Alexa, play (song title) by (artist) on Spotify,&#34; and she can play any song in Spotify's library. She can even play my playlists and playlists I subscribe to on Spotify. Some other music apps that are supported by the Echo are Pandora, TuneIn, and IHeartRadio.    Accessories  Included with the Echo Dot is the power cord to connect the speaker to the wall. Without it, the Echo will not work. Thankfully, the power cable is a Micro USB cable, which is the same as most phone chargers besides the iPhone. The power cord is 5 feet long, which is convenient. Amazon also offers some stylish cases to cover your Echo Dot and give it some color. The cases are sold on Amazon.com and are $14.99.    Ideal User  In my mind, the Echo is great for anyone with a Wi-Fi connection and a mild liking for music who wants to be able to fill a small room with sound. Because of the ease of setup and use, there isn't an age range for this product in my mind. I wouldn't even say the ideal user needs to have a Spotify or Amazon Prime subscription because of the number of free apps that are compatible with the speaker.    In conclusion, you will not find a speaker that matches the quality of the Echo Dot anywhere near this price. ",
"Rich Cobb","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought the Dot with a single purpose in mind: voice control for my home automation system. There are many other reviews discussing Dot’s other features, but here I want to share my experience with voice control. I do use my Dot to get weather and flash briefings, amuse myself with Alexa’s jokes, and (occasionally) try new “skills”. Alexa and Dot make a mostly fine home automation control experience, with a few caveats. Here’s the scoop!    Before I decided to try Dot I was looking for another scene controller to use in my living room. I have a Vera Plus home automation (HA) controller and large number of Leviton Vizia RF switches and dimmers around my home; there are eight devices in my living room alone, along with a Leviton wall mounted scene controller. I have scenes for reading, watching TV, early morning (dim lighting), cleaning, and so forth. In the living room it is tedious to get up to use the wall controller every time I want to make a change. In my bedroom, I use a MiniMote (a very small, 4-Button, handheld remote control made by Aeon Labs), which I keep on my nightstand. My first thought was to buy another one to use in the living room.    While the MiniMote is a terrific device, I really didn’t want to have another remote to keep tabs on; it’s small and svelte, which means it would find itself under a couch cushion in less time than it takes to queue up the next episode of Veep. Voice control seemed to be the perfect answer. But cost was a concern. The MiniMote is available here on Amazon for $36.95, so competing on cost would be a challenge. I was willing to pay more for voice control (Leviton scene and zone controls are in the $100+ range), but only if it worked. When I stumbled onto the Dot, I realized that if it worked I might never need a handheld or wall mounted controller. And any other benefits of Alexa would be free extras.    So how well does it work? I’m very satisfied and it is absolutely better that a handheld remote. Dot sits inconspicuously on a side table near the front of the living room. I can set a scene for reading with “Alexa, turn on Reading”, which turns on the floor lamp, sets the pendant lights over the couch to 40%, the coffee bar lights to 20%, and turns off the media center and fireplace lighting.    As to the caveats:    -My experience has been that most of the time Alexa will flawlessly understand and execute my commands. If there is background noise it occasionally won’t work, for example when watching TV.  -Occasionally Alexa simply misunderstands my annunciation, which I attribute to my occasionally sloppy New England accent. Repeating the command clearly nearly always works the second time.  -Configuration and setup (at least with Vera) is crucial to getting the results you want. Naming your devices simply is the best approach. Even with my large number of switches and dimmers this wasn’t too challenging, however I don’t try to control every device from the living room.  -The protocol for scenes is “Alexa, turn on [scene name]”.  If you have a scene that turns off devices you will still say “Alexa, turn on [scene name]”.  -You must avoid using the words “On” or “Off” in your scene names. Alexa confuses the On and Off actions with the name of an action.  -The protocol for turning on or off a specific device is “Alexa, Turn [On or Off] [room name] [device name]”. For example, “Alexa, Turn On Living Room Floor Lamps” or “Alexa, Set Living Room Coffee Bar Lights to 40 percent”  -Occasionally Alexa responds to my scene command that “some devices did not respond” even though things worked as expected. I not sure why this happens, probably Vera is too slow to respond through the various cloud interfaces.    Wish list:    One feature I really feel needs to be implemented is the ability to secure Dot access. I would use them in more places, however I’m not comfortable with having everyone in the house be able to trigger things.    Bottom line:    I’m glad I tried the Alexa interface to my Vera and I’d easily recommend it to anyone. The convenience of hands-free access to my HA devices is worth those infrequent misses. ",

I have a Tap and it's great because I can use it as a portable wifi or bluetooth speaker, but have to tap the button to activate Alexa. I thought I was missing out by not having an Echo that listened all the time. I was wrong, I'm not missing much of anything.    Before I get to the bad, what can Alexa do that is good?    She can give me weather forecasts and current conditions and they're accurate.    She can give me good deals exclusive to Alexa.    She can tell me where my Amazon stuff is.    She has a limited database of jokes, some of which are pretty funny.    She can add stuff to my cart for me to finalize and order later, she adds several things to choose from based on what you tell her and it's fairly accurate most of the time.    That about wraps up what Alexa can do for me.    &#34;Woah,&#34; you might say, &#34;she can do so much more!&#34; Can she?    &#34;Alexa order a dust pan&#34;  &#34;Amazon doesn't have the last desk fan you ordered, but here is a Lasko [...] for $37 dollars. Is this what you want?&#34;  &#34;Alexa stop.

Hallway is named Hallway, Fireplace named fireplace, etc.    &#34;Alexa, dim the fireplace light&#34;  &#34;I've found multiple devices named light, which one do you want?&#34;  &#34;Fireplace&#34;  &#34;Ok&#34;  Sometimes it works, sometimes it takes 5 minutes.    &#34;Alexa dim the fireplace&#34;  &#34;I'm sorry I can't find a device named fireplace&#34;    &#34;Alexa dim the fireplace light&#34;  &#34;I've found multiple devices named light, which one do you want?&#34;  &#34;Fireplace &#34;  &#34;I'm sorry the device fireplace is not responding &#34;  I open the hue app on the phone and dimming fireplace works like a champ.    &#34;Alexa dim all the lights&#34; or &#34;Alexa dim the lights&#34;  &#34;I've found multiple devices named Light, which one do you want?&#34;  &#34;All the lights&#34;  &#34;Ok&#34;  ---    &#34;Alexa add [product] to my cart&#34;  Half the time this doesn't work despite saying the search string that returns the product as the first hit on Amazon.com, and Alexa hears it correctly.    --    &#34;Alexa, send this to my Amazon Tap&#34;  &#34;I'm sorry, I can't do that yet&#34;    ---    &#34;Alexa, play iheartchristmas on iheartradio.&#34;  &#34;Playing Christmas songs from Amazon&#34;  I could never get it to do this. It always pirated what I said and played Amazon's station which is terrible.    So, what Alexa can do for me is extremely limited. And what she can do is frankly easier many times to just open the app on the phone and do it myself.    I tried to use Alexa to order things on Amazon as I think of them. If I tell her to just add it to my cart from the beginning, it works out pretty well. However if I don't understand her run on sentences as she describes the item in a much quicker dialogue with a very computerized voice with no inflections than she usually talks in - and I want her to simply add it to the cart so I can review it, she can't. I have to cancel it and re tell her to add it to the cart, and by then I could have done it from my phone.    So Alexa is a cool concept but it's not there yet. She's definitely not artificially intelligent in any definition of the word, and it's usually faster to do her limited actions on your phone. I'll try again in a year or two unless Google or Apple end up having a better solution. ",
"Steven M","February 22, 2017 ",4.0,"I bought the Echo Dot after some persuasion by friends who'd been given Dots as gifts. I was a bit apprehensive, because I've come to know other AI services quite well (Apple's Siri being the best example) and none of them have been wholly impressive. They all lack some sort of ability, whether that is cross-app support or the ability to use services that aren't native to the platform. Apple's Siri, for example, is still very limited in its ability to control and use third-party apps such as WhatsApp and Skype.    Echo Dot is an entirely different product altogether. It uses Amazon's own AI, Alexa, for its commands. Whether you spring for the full-blown Echo or this Echo Dot, you get the same access to the service. The main differences between this and the full Echo are the size and the price. The Dot can be had for $50, whereas the Echo tower retails at $179. I haven't had the chance to try out the tower, but I've heard nothing different about it compared to Echo. The only operational difference is that Dot is the only Echo device with a 3.5mm jack output, which enables you to connect it to external speakers. The tower requires a Bluetooth speaker connection.    Overall, I am impressed with Echo Dot. It is a very powerful device, and for the price, it cannot be beat. The form factor is small as well, so small that I have mine on my already-crowded bedside table. It takes up just about as much space as a coffee mug.    As far as its capabilities, there are some things that are worth noting. As of yet, there is no connection between Echo and any Apple products. I carry an iPhone, and my work is split between two iPads and Mac computers. All of my calendar information is in iCloud, which Amazon Echo cannot access. It would be nice in the future for Echo to read my daily schedule from iCloud, but that support is not currently present. It can read from Google, though, so those with Google Calendars or Android devices should be just fine. It won't be able to play media in your iTunes Library (although it can play from your Amazon library). This isn't a huge thing for me, but having a device which could read from iCloud would be a huge help to me.    In terms of daily usability aside from that, Echo definitely beats the competition. Through the Alexa mobile app (which you must download in order to set up your Echo), you can install &#34;skills&#34; which enable things such as daily news briefings or stock updates. They are all, to my knowledge, free to download. Even with none of these skills enabled, Echo is still an amazing device. I use my Alexa as an alarm clock every morning.    A bit more about skills. While the skill packages themselves are free to download and install, some require subscriptions to additional services. A few examples would be music streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora. Much like on a PC or a mobile device, both of these offer free music streaming. To enable the premium subset of features, both require a subscription. This is no different on Alexa - once you teach Alexa your account information, she will play your music. Both Spotify and Pandora offer premium subscriptions, though. And both are optional for PC as well as Alexa. For Pandora, paying will enable you to skip tracks more often and listen ad-free. On Spotify, free users aren't able to pick tracks individually. I subscribe to both premium services, so I can tell Alexa to play virtually any song from Spotify on-demand and she will. This will also work with Amazon Music, which is free and unlimited only to Amazon Prime customers. So, in essence, there are no additional fees REQUIRED to use the Echo. The only advantage of doing so would be to enable the subsciption-specific subset of privileges for a certain service.    Overall, I am very impressed with Echo Dot. It's an amazingly powerful device, and with new skills hitting the app almost every week, the only thing hampering the growth of its abilities is time. I will be a repeat buyer. ",
"Dylan Piekarski","January 8, 2017 ",2.0,"To start, I will say this is actually my second Echo Dot. My first one was a gift to me, and I move between houses, so I bought one more. And I would like to state, that it was really hard to convince me to be able to get one. Not gonna lie, the idea of having a device, let alone a little black puck with lights on it, that is always on, always listening, whether private conversation or not, is frighting. I hated the idea that there would be something that could record anything it heard in an instant, only to send it to a huge company to possibly use against you. I know that makes me sound paranoid, but its the truth. To be fair, I'm a bit of a geek. Watch a lot of movies and play a lot of games, but whatever. Long story short, I figured that if anyone wanted listen in on someone, its not hard to do. Were just in the age of technology. I also figured, I mind as well enjoy technology until it completely turns on us. Haha.    OK, now that the doom and gloom is done, lets get to the awesomeness.  A couple of things:    Well, first, its another well made Amazon product. It's sleek. It's shiny. It just plain looks cool.  Second, it can actually be really helpful. Whether you cooking or simply need to wake up, you can set a timer or alarm to your need. Need help with math homework? Simply ask and she might help. Or, do you just sit on the couch waiting for your next Amazon package to arrive? simply ask the phrase &#34;Alexa, wheres my package?&#34; and she lets you know  Third, it's really nice to be able to simply ask a question when it pops into your head and possibly get an answer.  Fourth, this can either be a good thing or a bad thing, but it helps you be lazy. &#34;Alexa, turn on the lights&#34;, &#34;Alexa whats 20 times 12?&#34; etc...    Lets talk about the actual device for a second. It looks really good, I think. It has the usual build quality you expect from Amazon, very good. Its simple. I mean four buttons: Action/Alexa, Mic Mute, Volume Up/Down. Not to mention, one cable (if you dont need the aux).  Also, it does have a speaker of its own! I was unsure as Amazon and everyone else pushes connecting it to another speaker or something for sound, but it does indeed have it own speaker. People also say that the sound quality of said speaker is poor. I disagree. Now, is it some booming, fantastic sounding speaker, no. But, it is more than adequate the asking Alexa an answer, in fact, I don't think it sound too bad at all. I play music through it and while not great, its not as bad as everyone says either. BUT, I would like to say that I have my Dot in my bedroom, where it is fairly quiet, when compared to the rest of the house. So I do agree that it will need to be paired with some other sound system for the best experience, but, I simply state that it is not a soundless puck.    Performance  I cannot give a good review, as I have not had it very long, but so far so good. She seems to hear me fine, and her actions are quick. I have had two things, mainly one I guess: 1.) Like the confuse bands easily. I asked to play The Neighborhood , but played some kids music with a tiger and, idk. She has the tendency to not always search the Amazon library, and is very picky and needy with exact names. For instance &#34;Alexa, play the Billie Holiday station&#34;, ...... &#34;The Billie Holiday station could not be found&#34;, ok, so I asked again, slightly more specific &#34;Alexa, play the Billie Holiday station on Amazon Music&#34;,...... &#34;Playing Billie Holiday station on amazon music&#34;  So, that is slightly annoying. I do wish, especially for specific bands, that you could specify which band/ song you want to play for future reference. Mabey when it pops up in the Alexa app, and you say &#34;no, it did not do what i wanted&#34; you would have the option to manually select the one you want, so she knows for next time.  2.) It had some internet connectivity issues. Mainly, I would be listening to a song and say &#34;Alexa&#34;, then she would glow red and say sorry your echo dot is not connected, please refer to your manual, blah blah blah. But here's the thing, it was still playing music and seemed to be connected to the app, so that was weird. It only seemed to happen one more time, the same thing, only this time the app said it was disconnected, yet the Dot still played music all fine. Unplugged it, and plugged it back in, it was ok then. I would like to point out, that the internet was fine the entire time. We have fast, reliable internet. And nothing else was having issues. SO, it probably was just a fluke thing, but im going to keep my eye out.    This is where I kinda run out of things to say, I haven't used it enough to say much else, but i will report back soon! ",
"Kindle Customer","February 24, 2017 ",4.0,"My Amazon Echo/Dot review:  Just before Christmas I decided to join the hands free digital assistant revolution.  I ordered two Dots and an Echo for my 1002 square foot condo.  They were on sale but on back order – the projected delivery date was January 14th.  Okay, they’re for me, $10 off each Dot and $40 off the Echo, no rush.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive the Dots on December 26th and the Echo today (January 4th).  Set up was super easy.  I already had the app on my phone so it took no time for the Dots.    I did change the name of the Dots to Kitchen Dot and Bedroom Dot – 1st Dot and 2nd Dot were just too confusing.  It did take me a while (who knows why – short between the operator and the keyboard maybe) to find the zip code/location change screen – it’s on the settings page in the App.  About four minutes after plugging in the Echo I realized that it and the Kitchen Dot were just a smidge too close to each other, so I updated the wake word on the Echo to Echo (it sits near the TV so, that should fix Alexa commercial wake ups too).    Streaming Spotify is super easy – even with my braces/lisp. Actually, I’m pretty amazed how even without doing much of the voice training, just how well the system understands me.  I speak softly, my voice is a little high, and new braces mean voicemail systems hang up on me and audio customer service menus don’t understand me at all - once running on any of the units, you can easily change radio station or playlist either vocally or via the Spotify app.  I’m not sure I’m ready to go Amazon Unlimited yet, I’ll have to play with it for a while.  I need to be able to create my own playlists and I love “radio” stations based off of a single track that introduce me to new artists.  I haven’t seen that available in Music Unlimited.  I am a little disappointed in the speaker quality of the Dot, it seems a bit tinny.  But, I connected to a better existing Bluetooth speaker in the bedroom and it’s fine.    My two favorite features are really simple ones but they mean a lot: I cook.  I really like to cook.  I can ask Alexa to set a timer while my hands are full and she does it and confirms it has been set.  Oh my goodness…. Bake cookies and set the timer with the oven mitt on?  Pan/plate/pot in hand?  Love it.  The Dot in the kitchen is loud enough I can hear the timer in the living room over the dishwasher and the TV.  The other is the ability to add items to a shopping list whenever I think of the item.  In the kitchen, the living room, the bedroom – if I remember, I can ask Alexa to add the item and she does and confirms it has been added! No digging for a piece of paper that just gets left behind, or a pen, or opening an app on the phone… *sigh* I’m feeling rather spoiled.    I haven’t gotten any of the linked outlets yet, but I will soon.  I recently purchased a set of five outlets with two remotes that I love – I can only imagine how much I will like a voice active option.    One issue I have – and I know it’s one others have addressed – but linked Dots/Echo options would be very nice.  I would love the ability to sync all timers/music/alarms with an Echo and a Dot or two – of course the option to sync, not an automatic or for.  A Dot in a child’s room doesn’t need to be sync’d to the Echo in the living room – but the option to be able to sync that kitchen timer, music for a get together, etc. on the fly would be fantastic!    Otherwise – so much fun! ",
"E. Talerico","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I'd been wanting to pick up an Echo since I first saw them advertised, but I already had a good stereo in my house and the Echo isn't equipped to connect to external speakers.  This unit is and its a delightful addition to my home music experience.  I now own two dots, each one serving a different room and playing over different speakers.  One is connected to a Harmon Kardon amplifier via Bluetooth, playing through a full sized pair of Yamaha speakers. The other plays alternately through either a Panasonic Bluetooth equipped boombox, or a pair of small computer speakers with a subwoofer. which I connect with an audio out cable.  The audio on all three devices is detailed and clear - my music as played by my Echo Dots is fantastic. By the way, there is a self contained speaker on the Dot - it is small, don't expect loud playback there - but the fidelity is quite good.  Its perfect for listening to the news over coffee in the morning, playing 20 questions, or finding out the weather forecast! The dot is small enough to fit easily in a backpack or the pocket of a suitcase, and she'll work as long as there is a Wi-Fi network available.  I was amazed at how responsive to my voice this device is.  Amazon promises that it will hear you anywhere in the room where she is placed - and for the most part this is correct. I've had a few instances when I need to repeat a request - but usually its because something is obstructing my voice (like when my father put a book on top of it!)  What is more amazing is how good, just out of the box, the unit was at understanding what I asked.  I have a voice which goes hoarse on me sometimes -( the day I got my first Dot I sounded as if I had laryngitis!) but regardless of the state of my voice, Alexa has no problems understanding my requests.  After some voice training (the Alexa app offers this feature) its even better.  I've had everyone in my house do the voice training exercise a few times and now Alexa is understanding and responding easily to every request she gets.  Its great.  Coupled with the expanded Amazon Music service (I uploaded my entire iTunes library to Amazon Music) its easy to play anything I want.  I can ask for a song, a playlist, or an album and she'll find and play it easily.  The only times I ever have problems is when the internet disconnects - in those rare incidences a request is met with a dull tone, a red light, and an apology from Alexa stating she can't comply right now.  When my network comes back online, she automatically reconnects so she is only occasionally out of service and usually only for a minute or two.  And I've only talked about the music features.  There is a growing body of skills for Alexa, most of them available for free from Amazon that make her a formidable search engine, a source of weather reports.  My only disappointment so far is the lack of a skill enabling her to respond in emergencies, but I'm sure there will be enough demand for it that we'll see one soon!  For under fifty bucks, this is quite simply one of the best values anywhere. ",
"Amazon Shopper","January 4, 2017 ",4.0,"It doesn't do a lot. It drops from the wi-fi a lot,,,, some things such as finding stores is pretty cool and playing music .......... it's ok - nothing super exciting but can be helpful. ",
"Donna Gleaves","January 2, 2017 ",5.0,"Echo Dot's Alexa is spot-on, and has become a welcome, untiring, no-attitude family helper with a purpose.  Do a web search for its capabilities, and you may be astounded.  There's lot s of comparison currently between Amaxon Echo Dot snd Google Home. I'm sure the latter will fill many needs, but its a closed system, is brand-new. Echo has been around for 2 years.  Because of Ech's open programming architecture, people keep writing new apps for it and expand its capabilities and versatility.  For our first foray into this on-line, modern, simple appliance-style AI, we decided that cheap was the way yo start.  The inexpensive Echo Dot's audio quality is, well, small -we knew thst from the outset. However,  our excellent-sounding  Samsung Multiroom R1 speaker has Bluetooth input, and so, after simple pairing, two simple words, &#34;Alexa, connect&#34; will send all subsequent Echo Dot, high quality audio to the R1, until I say &#34;Alexa,  disconnect&#34; -but, so far, I haven't wanted to disconnect it since we got it weeks ago!  Some BT devices are a bit squirrely with Bluetooth connections - but not Amazon Dot!  It's been the simplest and solidest BT we've ever used.    Do we sound happy? The longer we have Alexa, the more uses we discover. It's the best $50 we've ever spent.    For example, we use our Echo Dot mainly for home control: after decades of struggling with a cranky old-tech X10 home control system, Alexa accurately and effortlessly commands our new Insteon lighting system to control on, off and brightness by voice (though can't yet set timers or schedules without complex use of other apps and hardware).  Alexa can also command other, otherwise incompatible, home control technologies, thus becoming the go-between remote control among various brands of lightbulbs, dimmers, switches, thermostats and more. And, even without voice training,  our Echo Dot's voice recognition is amazingly accurate, and Alexa's synthetic speech is top-quality  and pleasant to listen to.  If need be, you can follow its recognition and actions on its smartphone app and offer tweaks to improve accuracy.  Then. There's the entertainment side.  Switching among the three NPR affiliate network systems we have in Montana is but a couple of words away.  Then, there's Pandora. Or TuneIn. Or a number of other audio sources. My &#34;Flash Briefing&#34; contains the news, sports weather, and other bits & pieces we choose to stitch together as a patchwork we can request at any moment, and the contents will always be timely.  Time? Weather? Just a simple request! And, at our house, it works from any of several rooms, eith only one device.    Sure, I've seen long lists of things Alexa can't do (yet) -smugly written, perhaps by fanboys of Google or Apple.  But what &#34;she&#34; CAN do is astounding, and sometimes even from a room or two away!    Wow!! ",
Jacquelyn,"December 11, 2016 ",3.0,"I think I bought too many o.o.    These really are a nice price and they allow easy access to Alexa from any room in your house. The device comes with its own speaker (not great, but works), however she can be easily paired or connected with other speakers.    The moment you say her name, she's listening. Her range and ability to hear us out really feels good. I have spoken to her from across a room while someone else (in-between me and the device) is playing games on their speakers, talking to their friends on Discord, without issue. You can ask her a variety of questions (When is the next Superbowl? When is the next Green Bay Packers Game? What is the weather? Who let the dogs out?) and she seems to always have a response. If there is something she doesn't know, you can look to expand her skills with the Alexa App. This app is fairly easy to use, though the interface could be smoother (navigating is a tad clunky). I already added skills such as LIFX to control my lights and honestly - this is really fun.    Now, Alexa isn't perfect. I have ran into a few odd things that I do hope Amazon will someday address. For example:    Having all of my smart devices (such as lights and TVs) plugged in and on so that I may control turning them on and off with apps and Alexa works great - until the power goes out at 5am. The moment the power returned, all my lights, TV, and even Alexa turned on. There may be a solution to this, but I will need to explore (such as setting schedules and having the devices check the schedule when powered back on). Until then, I fear power outages.    Alexa is always listening. If anyone says her name (TV commercial, Radio, a friend on Discord) she will respond. Being able to customize her name to Echo or Amazon instead doesn't fix the issue either. Having a custom name so that she really becomes &#34;my&#34; household device would really alleviate this. I do understand there are issues with people creating their own custom names, but even Alexa sometimes doesn't hear her name correctly and she will randomly jump into conversations picking up on phrases we can't quite figure out.    Combine the above issue with an accidental command to purchase (ie: News reporting a cute story about how a little girl accidentally purchased a dollhouse and then saying how funny they though it was that &#34;Alexa, ordered me a dollhouse&#34;). In just explaining the story to a friend over Skype I even accidentally triggered their device to try to order a dollhouse! Luckily you can turn ordering off or add a pass code, but caution that this is not the default.    Honestly though, that's about all I take issue with. The way Alexa allows me to command my devices through voice is really a new and fun experience. I really look forward to how this device will grow as smart homes become more popular. ",
Hybridness,"February 12, 2017 ",5.0,"There are a sea of in-depth reviews that would easily trounce what I have to say about my experiences with Alexa, but after having it for roughly a month, here are my thoughts on it.    - One thing that gets to me is the inability to sync my iPhone calendar to it; when I called Amazon support about it, they confirmed at the time that this is something that was not possible to do.  - Another thing that irks me is the inability to request Alexa to remind you to do (insert task) at a certain time (unlike Apple's Siri). As an example, if I say -- &#34;Alexa, remind me in 30 minutes to move the clothes from the washer to the dryer&#34; -- it will state that it will create a to-do list item that states &#34;30 minutes to move the clothes from the washer to the dryer&#34; but does not provide the timed reminder to do so.  - One very minor item revolves around the management of alarms in the Alexa app. If you get in the habit of requesting an alarm verbally from her (&#34;Alexa, set an alarm for one hour from now&#34; or something to that degree), after about a month, you will notice, within the Alexa app, that there are ~30 different alarms set). A little more to follow on the Alexa app itself.    On the other end of the spectrum though, the product was only 40 bones at the time of purchase. It has a more than adequate-sound, down-firing speaker that plays music and spits out information at a very high volume at max volume. It can easily recognize your voice (and other people's voice when requesting something from Alexa), even if there is music playing or other people talking in the background. The physical controls on the top of the device (mute, volume up/down, multi-function button) work very well with no issues. The USB power block and cable is not too bulky and is roughly 6' in length, respectively, which is a great thing as you can place the product anywhere you need to. Alexa even has Alexa-only unique deals (at an even lower/special discount) for some nice items!    I will state, though, that the Alexa app is a necessary aspect of the device, for better or worse. The app, while not bad, could be organized better as well as load up faster/be more responsive on my iPhone 7. It does get the job done and you are able to find everything you need about the Dot on the app, but as said before, it could be programmed/designed more effectively for a better user experience.    In the end, because of the first two items I mentioned, coupled with the Alexa app's quirks/performance issues, I have to give it a four out of five. By all means it is a good product, perhaps even a great product for those that have not experienced or do not have my aforementioned concerns. I was originally intending to return it, but because of all the little things it can do, it overshadows the things it (currently) cannot do for me. ",
"Joseph R.","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"I originally got this just to play around with - but it's pretty darn fun/useful!    Out of the box without any additional equipment its features are pretty limited. By itself - you can use it as a voice activated clock/timer, music player (With pandora, amazon music unlimited, iheartradio), calculator, simple fact/information checker, dictionary, and other generic commands.    With additional smart home equipment you can control lights, electronics, and other wifi/bluetooth/IR controlled technology.

Mccall","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I must say I like a few things about the Echo Dot and Alexa in general.  1) The price, it was very reasonable.  2) It controls my Nest fairly well.  3) Asking it to play music is cool    What I don't like about it  1) Frequently it has no answer to our questions.  2) It really needs to support Chromecast for casting Amazon and Netflix Video  3) Support for more than one bluetooth speaker.

"Metal bender","March 16, 2017 ",5.0,"Alexa is a VERY poor listener. I purchased a few dozen books from Audible Books and it's like pulling teeth to get this stupid robot voice to read them. Some, she flat won't read and others, I need to repeat the title at least a dozen times before this dumb twit  cues them up. Other times, she cuts me off mid-sentence and says she can't find what I'm looking for. VERY disappointed........ ",
JStiles,"March 21, 2017 ",3.0,"The Echo Dot is a great addition to our home. We use it mostly for music streaming from our Prime Music, and it is great for that.  We are still learning to use Alexa's Skills, and haven't gotten much beyond our shopping lists.  I have great hopes for much more to come from this little device. ",
n they wake up, and say Ok when they complete a task, only the Old Ones chime when they wake up. So I can tell who is responding.   When I say Alexa, multiple Echoes respond. The Old Ones light up and chime. The new ones light up. If I want music in the room that I am in, that Echo starts playing. The Borg knows in which room to play music.  If I want to turn on lights in another room, they confer among themselves and it is not clear, which one will control the lights. I can see 3 light up, hear 1 or 2 chime, and another says OK, when the action is done. The Ok may come from an Echo that is behind me or in front of me, and not necessarily in the room with the light.  It is sort of like living with a benevolent Borg.    I now have Internet service again.  The new Dots are not complete clones of the older devices. When my Internet connection was restored and I rebooted the modem, they did not all come on line at once. Some Echoes that were generally too far away to hear me, said: “Sorry. I’m having trouble understanding right now. Please try again later,” when I asked the first one for the time. [None of them could state the time earlier when there was no Internet connection, even though the alarm was timely.] Then when they all came on line, and I asked them the time, the Old Ones said “the time is…” but the newer ones said: “it is…’ All were correct.    In summary, I have become assimilated.I am more and more dependent on my Echoes to do all sorts of chores that I used to do.  The Echoes function like a hive mind, or the Borg. They are capable of some local functions, such alarms, but otherwise depend on the Internet for their higher brain functions. They are constantly chattering away silently among  themselves. Sometimes they start talking aloud for no obvious reason. I may hear one chattering in a far off room. They most definitely are talking about me and my habits. They are knowledgeable about science fiction. I hope that they enjoy watching Star Trek: TOS with me this month. I am doing a Re-Watch this winter. Then on to TNG. ",
"Carolyn Dempsey","February 5, 2017 ",2.0,"I like the original Echo just fine. But this device doesn't  sync music or timers with other Echo devices in the house. In my mind, this should be a basic function. Also, Alexa gets confused very easily by basic questions  that are answered quickly using Google Now. Software updates to fix these things should be possible. ",
"Mark Masaki","December 17, 2016 ",5.0,"Her name is Alexa, and she is awesome (she will ask you if you really think so and thank you for the complement).  This Echo Dot version of Alexa is the size of a hockey puck but has the same voice recognition ability that the full sized Amazon Echo has.  It is also connected to wifi and assists you the best that it can for an even better price.  There is a place to plug it into your home speaker system if you so choose, but their are primitive built-in speakers that will allow you to listen to the news or play music if she, say, is sitting on your nightstand or somewhere close in proximity.  Amazon Prime users benefit because Alexa can play whatever Amazon Prime song is available with a simple verbal request that starts with her name (i.e. Alexa, play the Star Spangled Banner).  You do not necessarily have to be close to her to give her a command, and she could even hear you over the chatter in a fairly noisy room.  She gives facts, dates, and computations, so she is also a good voice-activated computing tool as well (kids would &#34;cheat&#34; on their homework, parents beware).  Alexa can check things and people out on Wikipedia if she doesn't initially know, but wont unless you ask her to.  Alexa will stop whatever she is doing if you say &#34;Alexa, Stop,&#34; and there are no feelings hurt when you order her around.  I can set timers and alarms with my voice alone (i.e. ...time me for one minute... or ...wake me up every weekday at 7 AM...).  Using accessories compatible with the Echo, you can ask Alexa to do other things like turn on/off specific lights at any time, or a certain time each morning/day/night (i.e. Belkin WEMO light switches and Bulb accessories, Phillips Hue, etc.), and you can reach her from nearly anywhere in your home with a wireless remote, sort of like Tony Stark and his A.I., Jarvis, from Marvel Comics' Iron Man (Alexa knows who Jarvis is, just ask her).  Eventually there will be better AI's out there, but for now Alexa can do the basic day-to-day stuff for you, like add things to your electronic shopping list, remind you how many teaspoons in a tablespoon, and tell you the weather forecast for today.  She is exceedingly good at giving factual information (i.e. she knows the day most famous people died as long as it is documented).  The best part, however, is that Alexa is always learning new things.  So she will be a part of my family for a long time.  &#34;Alexa, you are Awesome!&#34; ",
SOHO,"October 31, 2016 ",3.0,"At the end of the review is my semi-amusing story about how Alexa abandon me and might abandon you too.  Meanwhile, I learned you have to be VERY specific with Alexa. &#34;sleigh bells&#34; is a band not a song (bands &#62; songs) and &#34;sleigh bells are you listening&#34; is content not a title &#34;winter wonderland&#34; (title &#62; content) and there are dozens of artists  that record pretty much every song (wth? &#62; classic) and even if you cite a known artist, like Bing Crosby, there are many recordings and remasterings, original, the movie, the 2009 record (recent &#62; past).  Pros:  - Voice recognition is pretty good. I'm sure the NSA collecting this data will be thrilled.    UPDATE: Search for the recent CNN news story where Amazon is being asked for information related to a murder investigation.  - You can press a button instead of having to say &#34;Alexa, ...&#34;  - Performs simple tricks like math calculations  Cons:  - Slightly regretting wanting one of the first units rather than waiting for the XMAS sales - no biggie - sunken cost.  - It only understands within limited contexts. You don't train it, it trains you. &#34;Play my music library&#34; typically doesn't work, it finds a station instead, but &#34;shuffle my music&#34; which you learn when it says &#34;shuffling your music&#34; as a confirmation.  - Playlists? Haven't gotten these to work. It's the entire music library or nothing from my music, it'll find someone else's library  Christmas Story:  Part 1:  I had change my review from 5 stars to 1 (in anger), as I wrote &#34;I LOVED IT! NOW I HATE IT. Alexa, Why ARE YOU SO F'n SLOW ON XMAS EVE? Used to be responsive. Had gone to hell fast. only now at XMAS. Bad design centralizing requests? Guess so.&#34; OK, it's after the holiday and what we may be seeing is the problem with capacity management during a nationwide rollout,  After all, your requests are all centralized back at Amazon, something the NSA will be happy with, surely.  But in retrospect, this was a trivial inconvenience not comparable to the Obama Healthcare website implementation, which a large part of the country will remember was a complete disaster.  Part 2:  So, whilst trying to get Alexa to wake up, on the holiday, I tried to install and use the Alexa app. Sad news, my Galaxy S3 is not compatible.  So, my daughter installed the app on her cheapo but newer Android. Guess what? It slammed my Echo Dot to her account, unregistering the device from mine and automatically registering it to hers.  Alexa's loyalties are to the app, not to your account (app &#62; account).  Customer service was great to help sort it out.Seems a design flaw, but hey, perhaps you want to take over nearby Dot's when you see them.  Not sure what you could do with that, but the effect was frustration for me as Alexa played a strange music library I did not recognize, until I powered it down and ran through a new device registration on my account.  Have fun folks! ",
"Jim K","February 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I received this as a gift and due to who gave it to me, I wanted to like it. But there is very little that it helps me do that I can't do elsewhere...    PROs: - It makes use of my Amazon Prime Music stations. This is the only reason why I have any interest in keeping it. I really like Amazon Prime Music (six stars) and this is the best stand alone streaming device when I am at home (as long as I keep it on one station).  - &#34;Alexa! Tell me a joke.&#34; and other easter eggs. It can be a good source for party tricks.  - Other PROs? Ummmm, I can't think of one at the moment.    CONs: - You have to speak everything. That's the only functional interface.  - You have to spend more time thinking about how to phrase your command than it takes to click through menus on an app for other devices.  - It doesn't work very much like Hal (another easter egg, by the way). I can recognize your speech pretty well, but it can't interpret the thought in your spoken words very well. I cannot imagine ordering products this way without having visual feedback about what I ordered.  - If your spoken command was interpreted incorrectly you waste even more time.  - The Android app is virtually useless. You have almost no control over the Dot via the app, other than showing you what you've done. Plus, the app takes FOREVER to load. Maybe I get if I open after restarting my phone and opening the Alexa app the first time. But if I just hop over to another app, send a message or take a call, it seems to back to step one.  - It's not wireless. It needs a power cord plugged into the wall to operate. It would be nice to have a battery so I can take Alexa around the house with me.  - It looses Bluetooth paring with my speakers almost every day. You can't just go through paring to find the device. You have to forget paring and re-pair (which requires menus on two devices, really three when you consider the Alexa menu is on an app).    In short, as long as I can play one of my favorite music stations, it stays, otherwise it will go into the closet which would be a big disappointment to the person who gifted this to me if they ever find out.  - Knowing that Alexa is ALWAYS listening is kind of creepy. This causes you to mute the microphone taking away the advantage of calling out &#34;Alexa!&#34; arbitrarily. ",
"Amazon Customer","December 24, 2016 ",5.0,"Having grown up during the technological revolution, I believed computers that you could fit in your hand were going to be the biggest invention of my lifetime. The Amazon Echo Dot is by far the most advanced piece of commercially sold technology that we will see for many years. This coaster-sized piece of plastic is able to understand everything I say from anywhere in the room. The add-ons are definitely worth it. Once I received the add-ons, I was able change the temperature in my house, change the channel on the TV, and turn on or off the lights.  Having packed what seems like an impossible amount of technology in such a small space, Amazon has successfully brought the movie “Smart House” to life (without the part where the house turns evil). The movie came out in 1999 and technology companies have been trying to recreate the technology ever since. Siri and Cortana have come a long way, but it is obvious that Alexa is the champion. Although Amazon has been around for only half as long (and has been working on technology even less) compared to Apple or Windows, they have become a leader in the industry.  The capability that this machine has is limitless. Not to mention its’ range. You can be standing on the other side of the room and saying, “Alexa” will trigger her response immediately. The Echo Dot has seven microphones in order to her from whatever side you are on. It also adapts to your vocabulary in time, making it easier for you to speak like you normally would and not as if you were speaking to a robot. Not only that, but Alexa will cancel out any background noise in the room and will be able to hear you with a voice recognition software.  Although the cost of “Smart Home” kits is substantially more than the Echo Dot, it is more than worth it to have. You can practically make your entire house hands-free. Amazon offers many different kits, including: lights, security, and even power. These kits, expensive as they are, are what really give the Echo Dot life. Without these kits, the technology is still far beyond anything before it but when you add the kits in, the technological advance is unseen before now.  You will not regret this purchase. Whether it be the advanced technology, range of the speakers, or outstanding add-ons, the Amazon Echo Dot will simplify your life and bring you into a new era. ",
"Jared Reed","December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Maybe I've just been spoiled by Siri for so long but I don't feel like it was Carey useful or &#34;smart&#34; the answer to most things was I don't know if I'm unsure what you're asking me etc. the wifi and Bluetooth connectivity are very spotty at best and it's not because of my equipment (have brand new google wifi and high end home theater). One of the worst things is that I have to yell very loudly to get it to activate. I had it for 2  days and returned it. Going to try google home and I'm glad I decided to try the echo dot before purchasing the echo for over 3 times the cost. ",

Tweeterdoctor,"March 7, 2017 ",2.0,"So I just bought my 2nd echo dot in the course of a week.  I enjoy tech and wanted to make more of a smart home but don't have the cash for all the necessary switches and things yet.  So I started small with a five pack of Etekcity RF remote outlets (available on Amazon).  After a few months I bought a Hook smart hub for $50 bucks(on Amazon) which allowed me to put those Etekcity outlets on WiFi app control.  I wasn't planning at first at doing Alexa voice control but it did intrigue me, so I bought one and used it for a couple days and then turned around and bought a 2nd.  I can't believe how easy it was to set up and tie it in with the Hook Hub and then my Harmony remote.  The echo Dot works well with my Bluetooth connection to my home stereo and even Bluetooth hook up to my phone.  I do have some minor complaints.  Echo Dot will only Bluetooth to one device at a time, so you can't get Alexa to connect to your phone and to a Bluetooth speaker and stream from phone to speaker with voice control.  You can use your Amazon Music account to stream your cloud music, but this is frustrating since I don't have all of my music on my Amazon Account, most everything is on my phone.  So Amazon if you're listening, you need improvement here.  Also having 2 dots in my house now, I wish there was more communication between them.  We have one in our bedroom on the 2nd floor and one in the living room.  My wife wants to tell Alexa to give me a message while I'm watching TV downstairs and she can't do it.  These are just minor issues for me for now, but I dropped a star because I'm not completely satisfied yet.  We'll see how Alexa improves in time.  I am ready however to buy at least 3 more but will have to wait until I can justify the output of the cash.  Some incentive would be for Amazon to upgrade the features. ",

Emily,"April 12, 2017 ",4.0,"This item is not the same as Siri. It can play apps (heart radio), tell the weather, give some basic information, or make purchases through your amazon account. However, it cannot search the web for answers, or at least not very competently. The one I have is pretty glitchy (it is NOT my internet since I have 1 gig fiber). When giving replies it regularly pauses mid answer, or I only get a blip for an answer. I would probably not have bought this item except I got it on black Friday for a great deal. I would not recommend this for anyone who wants something like Siri. ",
"L. Es..","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"It's a novelty $40.. Now $50 gift. I got two of them as christmas gifts. Its an alarm, a timer, It will play music through its tiny little speaker, its gives you basic weather info, a dictionary, an encyclopedia, a calendar... etc. but definately not smart (yet?) Ok, she's dumb as a box of rocks.  Its not like asking google something..  My phone does everything Echo wants to do.. I do however enjoy the hands off element, the alarm and the NPR News Flash Briefing.... It was easy to set up, just follow the directions. It's tiny and can fit in the smallest space near an outlet.  I have one in my bedroom. and the other is hidden in my living room. I like it as an instant night light, an alarm, timer and basic weather and news info..You can buy pricey &#34;smart&#34; light bulbs and sockets from amazon to turn your home into a smart home. ******Just a thought, If amazon wanted to do some good. They would provid them to the vision impaired for free. They could navigate to a certain area by where the sound is coming from. The Time, Date and Temperature would be easily known. Music can be played and News reports just by asking.****** ",

yagz143,"March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"At first, I loved my echo. It did everything I needed it for, and it was cool finding new skills to play around with. Except, one day it just completely stopped working (Only had the thing for less than 2 months!). Wouldn't even turn on. Luckily, Amazon has good customer service and they exchanged it for me. However, it's a pain just to go through the process contacting customer service and doing the exchange. I am happy I have a working echo now tho. ",
"e dct","April 3, 2017 ",2.0,"Loved this until it stopped working a few months after receiving it. I contacted Amazon and was helped by kind service members. After getting walked through resetting the device and some other tests they determined that it was a hardware failure. The device is only covered by warranty for up to 90 days and they do not have an repair services. So 4 months with the product, the only option that Amazon gave me was whether or not I wanted to buy a new echo dot for a slight discount, and this discount required that I ship them the old device.

Duane,"December 1, 2016 ",5.0,"The Echo Dot is pretty good. Our house has three of them. There are a couple of issues I have with them, though: 1) sometimes I would have to tell Alexa multiple times to do what I want her to do, even after getting close to the unit and speaking clearly, 2) sometimes Alexa would respond when I didn't give her a command; for instance, today, I was watching TV, and suddenly, Alexa started playing music. I don't think the TV gave her any instructions, I sure didn't. ",
Sarcastro,"April 12, 2017 ",3.0,"Usually I've been nothing but thrilled with our Amazon branded products.  We own 2 kindles, 3 Fires, an Echo, countless Amazon basics.    But this Dot has been a bust.  I don't know if we got a defective one or what, but it just dies every so often in the middle of a song / question / answer / game.    Sometimes it just listens to our request, spins, and then does nothing.    Very disappointed.  If it worked as well as the full sized echo I'd be giving it 5 stars since we love ours.  This Dot is just a lemon though. ",
AmazonJunkie,"April 22, 2017 ",3.0,"It looks really cool, but works maybe half the time for things I want to know.  It does well with simple things - 'Tell me the weather tomorrow', 'Give me the top news', but if you ask it anything a bit more complicated, it is 50/50 if you will get a response or not.  Alexa has even stopped saying 'Hmmm...I don't know the answer to that' and just gives me this stupid 'ding...and nothin.'  I asked her today - &#34;Is there a snow delay for the Philadelphia School District today'...and got the very annoying 'Hmmm...I can't find the answer' response from her.  I tried it multiple way, and nothing worked.  Since I couldn't get Alexa to tell me if my son's school was closed or delayed due to snow, I had to find my laptop and look it up.  So when I found my laptop and realized he did indeed have a 2 hour delay, I took this time to write the review.  I gave her 2 weeks to make me happy,  she isn't getting any better. ",
"Rose F.","March 10, 2017 ",1.0,"I love my dot. I keep it in my bedroom but want to get another for my kitchen. I am always adding new skills to it and I just really enjoy messing with it.

"Eric H.","January 6, 2017 ",3.0,"I was skeptical about the usefulness of Alexa, but I'm a believer now.  I first purchased an Amazon Tap for my wife because I wanted her to be able to take it with her wherever she went in the house and this was the only available portable &#34;Alexa&#34; option.  I quickly learned two things.  First was that Alexa is really cool and quite useful.  Second is that having to tap a button to wake up Alexa is annoying.  I immediately wanted to make a move to an &#34;always on&#34; Alexa device.  This left me with two choices, the Echo and the Dot.  The Echo is the easy choice, but it didn't make sense to me to get the Echo because it is basically a Dot with a nice built in speaker.  For the price difference between the two, I could get the Dot and pair it with a great quality Bluetooth (or wired) speaker.  It just gives you a lot more options, including being able to wire it directly into a home stereo system.    Configuring:  The Dot is extremely easy to set up through the Alexa app on your phone.  You can be up and running within a couple minutes after you go through the simple set up program and get it connected to your WiFi.  The Echo, after configuring and connecting to WiFi, runs entirely in the Amazon cloud.  This means that it does not run through your phone, but rather runs off internet based programming and only needs to be connected to WiFi.  Your phone is only used to give access to certain cloud based programs and &#34;skills&#34;.  After that, it runs independently, but may send info back to your phone.  Overall, it is very easy and intuitive.    Usefulness:  I seem to find new uses for the Dot every day.  Like most people, my primary use is for music.  I have it connected to Amazon Music, Pandora, Spotify, iHeart Radio and TuneIn.  You can be very vague and just ask for a genre of music or you can ask for a specific title via a specific music service.  I listen to a wide variety of music and whether it is rock, metal, rap, country, jazz or classical I have always been able to find what I wanted to listen to with Alexa.    Outside of music, I use Alexa to control my thermostat, turn lights on/off, lock the door, check weather, check calendar, get news updates, sports scores, order pizza and even play some fun interactive games with Alexa.  Amazon offers a huge variety of &#34;skills&#34; that can be enabled on your Dot and that list continues to grow as more companies offer these interactive options which are similar to apps for your smartphone.    Ease of use:  One Dot can cover a large size room for voice recognition pretty well.  The only time that I have had an issue is when it is placed too close to the speaker and it is trying to hear me over the music.  I have purchased multiple units and have them throughout the house.  I also have one that I put in my office at work. I'm constantly amazed at how accurate it is at understanding what I am saying.  It very rarely has trouble understanding me.    Conclusion:  It is hard for me to imagine not having this very useful item around now that I have become accustomed to it.  It is one of the most useful things that you never knew you needed.  Of all of the Alexa options, I would pick the Echo Dot based solely on its versatility and low price point.  It has all of the functionality of the full size Echo and you can pair it with a high quality Bluetooth or wired speaker system for better results than you can get with the Echo alone.  I would and have bought this product again. ",

We'll probably be buying more. ",
