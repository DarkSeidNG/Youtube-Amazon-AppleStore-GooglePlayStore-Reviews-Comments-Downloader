Deanokat,"April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"IMPORTANT UPDATE (3/8/17): As you read my original review, please be aware that Amazon announced in early February (2017) a new firmware update that allows Amazon Tap owners to enable a hands-free option! By going into &#34;Settings&#34; in the Alexa app, you can now choose the hands-free option and have your Tap respond to voice commands without touching it, just like the Echo and Echo Dot! This is a fabulous development and something Tap owners have been hoping for. Thank you, Amazon!    Since the lack of hands-free operation was the one major shortcoming of the Tap, this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better. One thing to keep in mind, though, especially if you use your Tap on battery power: The hands-free mode will drain the battery more quickly, because it requires the microphone to be on at all times. But since you can easily toggle between hands-free or regular tap mode using the Alexa app, you can pick and choose how you want to use your Tap for maximum battery life and convenience.    -------------------------    I admit that I was a little skeptical when Amazon first introduced its Echo device. But I decided to buy one anyway, thinking that if I didn't like it I could easily sell it. After all, back in the early days of the Echo it was in very high demand. So the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal. Today, as an avid music listener who loves to cook, I'm thrilled that I decided to give the Echo a try.    I had wanted a device that I could stream music with in the kitchen, and the Echo’s hands-free voice control made it very appealing. But how would it sound?? That question was quickly answered as soon as I set up and started using my Echo. The fact is, I was absolutely blown away by how great it sounded; and how well it worked.    I grew very used to the many features of the Echo, but I wanted to take them with me when I left the kitchen. And as wonderful as the Echo is, it’s not very portable. There’s this little thing called a plug that has to remain in the wall in order for it to work.    Enter the new Amazon Tap.    The biggest reason I was so excited when Amazon announced the new Tap was because of its portability. With a rechargeable battery that offers up to 9 hours of playback, along with its compact size, the Tap is made to be taken places. I can now carry all of the fabulous features that I have on my Echo into other rooms of my house, the backyard, the patio, the garage, or even places away from home.    I mentioned before that I listen to a lot of music, and I happily pay a small annual fee to store all of my music in Amazon’s Cloud. As a result, I can take my entire music collection anywhere I go, and it’s available to play at the touch of a button. (Yes, you have to push a button on the Tap before you can tell it your instructions, but that’s a very small price to pay for total portability.)    I was hopeful that the Tap’s sound would be as good or better than the Echo’s, and I was not disappointed. With its dual stereo speakers and 360-degree omni-directional audio—with Dolby—the Tap sounds AMAZING! Trust me: I’m pretty fussy when it comes to how my music sounds and I am blown away by what I hear coming from the Tap. I own a Bose wireless Bluetooth speaker that I’ve used for streaming music and I can honestly say that prefer the sound of the Tap. Some people may think the Tap doesn't have enough bass response, but I think the overall tone is just right.    What makes the Tap even more impressive is its compact size. This thing is a cylinder that’s only 6” tall and 2-1/2” in diameter. And it’s loaded with dynamic sound and a boatload of voice-controlled features. With Tap, I can play music from my library, Amazon Prime Music, Pandora, IHeartRadio, Spotify, and other sources. I can ask it to tell me the news, the weather, or the score of my favorite sports team’s game. I can ask it what the status of its battery is. I can even use it to order a pizza or control my WiFi thermostat (I have the&nbsp;Sensi Wi-Fi Programmable Thermostat 1F86U-42WF for Smart Home, Works with Alexa). It really is an amazing device. It even functions as a Bluetooth speaker for streaming music from any Bluetooth-enabled device.    As expected, the build of the Tap is top-notch. Amazon has certainly become a quality device maker, and the Tap shows off that fact beautifully. Its design is simple and intuitive. The Talk button is easily accessible on the front of the unit and the playback controls—Play/Pause, Previous/Next, and Volume Up/Down—are right on top. In addition to the microphone, there are also five LED indicator lights on top, and they pleasingly light up as necessary to show that the Tap is responding. The Power button, a 3.5mm audio input, Micro-USB port, and WiFi/Bluetooth button reside on the back of the unit. (Note: There is no headphone jack, which is a bit surprising for a portable device.) The bottom of the Tap is non-slip rubber, and the top is smoother rubber. The sides are covered with a fabric mesh.    Setup of the Tap is virtually effortless. The device went from its impressive packaging to being up and running in about 3 or 4 minutes. The Alexa iOS app really is fantastic and makes setup a breeze. (I wish more makers of WiFi-enabled devices would learn a thing or two from Amazon in this regard.)    My only concern about the Tap is a relatively small one: I’m just not sure how well it will hold up over time. If I’m going to be carrying this little baby around everywhere I go, I’m hoping that it will withstand minor bumps or drops. I did order an&nbsp;Amazon Tap Sling Cover - Black&nbsp;for it, and I think that will help keep it safe. But the one big drawback of the sling cover is that the Tap won’t fit into the charging cradle while it’s in the sling. You can still charge the Tap by using the Micro-USB connection in the back, but the convenience of the charging cradle is lost. And that’s a shame, because the charging cradle is a nice, simple way to charge the device. I wish Amazon could’ve thought of a way to protect the Tap while allowing you to use the charging cradle, too. (Also, maybe supplying an optional lanyard would've been nice.) One more thought: I wonder a bit about the lifespan of the battery. After all, I don't think it's replaceable.    All in all, I couldn’t be much happier with the Amazon Tap. It really is the Echo’s little sister, and it gives me all the functionality of the Echo with one big bonus: total portability. Some people might be put off by having to push the Talk button in order to communicate with the Tap, but like I said before: That’s a very small price to pay in exchange for being 100 percent cord-free. At the introductory price of $129.99, the Amazon Tap is an incredible bargain. It’s one of the coolest technological devices I’ve ever owned. As great as the Echo is, in my mind the Tap is even better. Alexa, I’m in love all over again.    UPDATE Re: Durability (4/13/16): A few minutes ago, one of my cats knocked my Tap off of a table in the living room. The Tap, which was streaming music from the cloud, fell about three feet, directly onto a hardwood floor. I have to say, I was more than a little bit worried. But the Tap kept right on playing and there is absolutely no damage to it at all. And my Tap is totally naked (I do not use the protective Sling with it). This makes me feel pretty good about the overall durability of the Tap. :)    UPDATE (5/3/16): I still love the Tap, but there's one thing I've found very annoying. I've been using it on my bedside table of late to play music while I'm falling asleep. Unfortunately, the Tap's power button is lit up by a very bright LED, and it stays lit while music is playing. If my head is close to the table next to my bed--and it frequently is, because I sleep on my side--the light is a distraction. So I've had to move the Tap down to the floor to get the light away from my face. I wish they would've chosen a more muted light for the power button. Or maybe provided an option to dim or turn off the light completely. ",
"Quentin Moore","August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.    It contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. It also has Dolby stereo speakers for playing music. The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.    I’ve been testing the Tap for several days now. Here’s what I think so far:    ### What I Like ###    I find that the Tap understands my verbal commands accurately. This could be due to the fact that, since it’s button activated, I’m always very close to the device when I speak to it. Nevertheless, it’s nice that Tap understands me the first time. This was my experience with the Amazon Echo as well.    The audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. I test portable speakers all the time and I’d say the Amazon Tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. Don't expect Bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.    No other portable speaker device offers voice control and Wi-Fi streaming. Thus the Amazon Tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. This is especially true if you already have Amazon Prime and Prime Music.    It supports many great services. Like the Amazon Echo that came before it, the Amazon Tap supports popular music services such as Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.    Battery life has been good so far. I used it off and on for a couple days without charging it. I’ll post an update once I have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life. So far so good, however.    ### What I Don’t Like ###    No Voice Activation: As the name implies, you activate the Amazon Tap by “tapping” the microphone button.  I can see why the device should work this way when you are on the go. After all, you don’t want random people in the public talking to your Tap, ordering pizza, requesting a Uber driver, or ordering groceries. I also suspect the battery will last longer if the Tap isn’t always listening for your voice. I just wish voice activation was available when the Tap is on its charging cradle. Alternatively, if I could activate the Tap with a Bluetooth headset or other Bluetooth accessory, that would be cool too.    Amazon Tap doesn't offer the best sound money can buy. By Bluetooth speaker standards, the Taps audio is fine.  However, the bass level is uninspiring and audio can become distorted at high volumes. Thus, if you prefer having the best portable Bluetooth speaker in terms of audio quality, the Tap should not be your first choice.  I’d love to see a premium version of the Tap with better audio. Perhaps Amazon can create the Amazon Tap Boombox! Perhaps a Boombox docking station?!?!?    The Amazon Tap Sling cover is not a good accessory.  The Sling accessory is called a cover even though it doesn't cover much.  You can't charge the Tap when the Sling is on and attaching and removing the Sling is difficult.  This makes the Sling pretty much unusable. This is not exactly a disadvantage of the Amazon Tap but I think it's worth noting.    ### Bottom Line ###    If you are in the market for a portable Bluetooth speaker that does a whole lot more than just play music, the Amazon Tap is the best choice available. It provides good sound relative to its price range, good battery life, and the unique ability to accept voice commands. It also has the advantage of Wi-Fi music streaming from your iTunes collection as well as from popular music services like Spotify and Pandora. The Tap's audio is at least on par with speakers in its class, yet, it has functionality not available in any other portable speaker.    If you already have Amazon Prime, the Tap has another advantage over similar devices. Your Tap will have instant access to a large library of music via Prime music.    While I think the Tap is great at what it’s supposed to do, the lack of voice activation will probably surprise and disappoint many people. This is especially true if they have used the Amazon Echo. If you want the ability to talk to your speaker without touching it, you should get the Amazon Echo or Echo Dot instead. I ordered the Echo Dot and will post a review after I test it.    &gt;&gt; Do I recommend the Amazon Tap? &lt;&lt;    Yes, but only to people who are shopping for something that is more a portable speaker with the Echo feature than a portable Echo with voice activated control. The nice thing is, once you start streaming music to the Tap, you probably won't want to talk to the device for a while anyway. Thus is may not too much a hassle to walk over to the device rather than speak to it from a distance.    For the most part, I plan to use my Tap for playing music from Prime Music and from Spotify. I will mostly use the device at the pool, when I’m washing my car, at the dog park, and during my next vacation (in the hotel room and at the beach). We'll see if I keep it or if I re-gift it.    ### Suggested Improvements ###    - The Amazon Echo can be activated with your voice only. The Amazon Tap can only be activate by tapping the microphone button.  - The Amazon Tap has a rechargeable battery and is portable. The Amazon Echo relies on external power (i.e. a power outlet).  - The Amazon Echo has better sound quality than the Amazon Tap. For the best audio, however, you should get an Echo Dot plus a pair of nice speakers.    ### Q&amp;A ###    Q: What’s the difference between the Amazon Echo and the Amazon Tap?    The two main differences between the Amazon Echo vs the Amazon Tap are:  - The Amazon Echo can be activated with your voice only. The Amazon Tap can only be activate by tapping the microphone button.  - The Amazon Tap has a rechargeable battery and is portable. The Amazon Echo relies on external power (i.e. a power outlet).  - The Amazon Echo has better sound quality than the Amazon Tap. For the best audio, however, you should get an Echo Dot plus a pair of nice speakers.    Q: Which should I get? Amazon Echo, Amazon Tap, or Echo Dot?    To decide on which product to get (Amazon Echo vs Echo Dot vs Amazon Tap), see the bullets below:  - If you want a portable Bluetooth speaker that you will use away from home, get the Amazon Tap.  - If want to connect your Amazon voice controlled device to external speakers to get premium sound, get the Echo Dot.  - Otherwise, if you want a stand alone, voice activated and controlled speaker, get the Amazon Echo.    Q: Is the Amazon Tap always on or do you have to “tap” it to activate it?    As of this writing, Amazon is only activated by &quot;tapping&quot; the microphone button. It doesn't support voice activation, as of this writing.    Q: Does it work with my existing Echo?    Amazon Tap does not connect to or interact directly with Amazon Echo or any other device. However, Amazon Tap can be connected to the same Amazon account and to the same Wi-Fi network as an Amazon Echo or any other Amazon device. Simultaneous access to paid services may be limited however.    Q: Are there any costs associated with using the Amazon Tap?    You don't have to pay anything to use Amazon Tap. However, some of the connected services may require a fee in order to access those services with Tap.    Q: Does Amazon Tap require Amazon Prime?    No. Amazon Prime is not required in order to use Amazon Tap.    Q: How long does the battery last?  Amazon states that the Tap's battery will last up to 9 hours of active use and up to three weeks of stand by time.    Q: What languages does Amazon Tap understand?  Amazon Tap only understand English as of this writing.    Q: What services does Amazon Tap connect to?    Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.    Q: Does the Amazon Tap work with iTunes?    Yes. Amazon Tap can stream music from iTunes.    Q: Does Amazon Tap work with other speakers?    No. The Amazon Tap has its own stereo speakers. It does not work with other speakers    Q: Does tap work while I’m driving?    A: Yes. You can use it as a Bluetooth speaker for your smartphone or other device.  You can also use voice control and Wi-Fi streaming if the Tap is connected to Wi-Fi or a mobile hot spot while in your car.    &gt;&gt;&gt; I hope you found this review helpful. If so, let me know. Post a comment. Also, feel free to ask me questions about the Tap. &lt;&lt;&lt; ",
"Devin Stephens","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"The Amazon Tap is like having a mini SONOS speaker that can travel with you anywhere you go!! This was the first device that has built this much excitement for me when Amazon announced it.. I pre-ordered and it arrived early!!  So did my CASE/Sleeve!!  WOW what a GREAT Speaker!  Amazon has a winner here!! Especially with it’s “Tap” and “WiFi” features!  This is the speaker I have been waiting for, for years!!    First Sound Quality - Sound quality is simply Amazing..  This sounds better than my Beats Pill and my older JBL Flip!! Perfect blend of sounds!! Streaming over WiFi even sounded AMAZING!!  I tested with Pandora, Spotify, and Iheart along with Amazon Prime music.. Every service sounded simply amazing when it came to sound quality!!  The speaker is VERY loud and offers plenty of volume, even for a small group to enjoy!!  I have always been impressed with Dolby sound processing and was not let down in this speaker!!  There are two speakers in this device which produces WONDERFUL STEREO sound!!  So yeah, so far I am very happy with the sound and the volume this tiny speaker can produce!!    Tap Function - OK so this is the feature that really impressed me and had me excited.. There are TONS of bluetooth speakers on the market BUT NOT MANY that can work OVER WiFi and that can connect to all these services without needing your phone!!  Not even the small SONOS speaker can run off batteries (Unless they have a new one out).. The tap function WORKED GREAT, just like Alexa always has!!  I said “ Play the band skillet from my Amazon music collection” and it responded saying shuffle was going to shuffle my Skillet songs!  I have grown to love my ECHO so MUCH that I don’t even use my Sonos anymore.. So I was very happy to see that Alexa and the “Tap” function worked so WONDERFULLY on this speaker..  I do wish this speaker had an “Always” listening feature like the ECHO but hey, i'm sure that would KILL batteries.. I am fine with “Tapping” a button for WiFi features    Don’t Have WiFi? - No worries! This works JUST FINE as a bluetooth speaker :-) WiFi not needed and all you lose is “Alexa” and her “Tap” features such as WiFi streaming.. For a bluetooth speaker only, this still sounds AMAZING!!! And is still WELL worth the price!!  Amazon has built a wonderful sounding speaker    Pros  Charge Station - I love the simple “Place on the stand” to charge.. No fumbling with cords after dark trying to get this baby to charge! Just sit and go    I haven’t fully been able to test the battery yet so I won’t pretend like I have BUT if this last 7 - 9 hours I will be very happy! My JBL flip is only rated at about 3 hours    Wonderful Clip Case options - I ordered the orange and find it compliments the speaker GREATLY!!  Provides GREAT protection, personalizes your tap, and gives you the ability to hang or clip your tap to a bag!!  Can even charge while in the case!! For full case review, I will have one posted soon on the case listing!    Better than MOST $100 speakers on the market! A lot better!! I own several and this one offers the best sound quality out of all I have.. Please KNOW this is also the newest and most of my others are at least 1 year old!  Items improve so I am not saying the other speakers haven’t improved.. I am just saying this tap is BETTER than all I own!!    No need to waste your phone battery at home!! Stream over Wifi and not your phone!!    Will connect to Mobile Hotspot (Tested with AT&T & Nexus 6P)    Easy to setup via the Alexa App (App not needed, you can also setup online)    Works with all the popular services.. I have been using mostly with AMAZON music however because of Prime music and really, Echo has kind of converted me to the Amazon platform for music.    Tested with I-Tunes just fine (Via Iphone and my Imac) (I know everyone always ask if it works with I-Tunes)    Yes, this will order an UBER.. I tried, just like my Alexa..    This is FULL Alexa meaning you can call an UBER, order a pizza, ask about the weather.. This speaker is NOT just for music!!    Overall: So this is just the beginning!! I know a lot of people will be flocking to Amazon today and see how the pre-orders went, especially after kind of flopping the last Fire TV 4k release.. So far I am happy and played with it for several hours so far!! This speaker is far superior that my other speakers I own!!  I highly recommend it! AMAZON HAS A WINNER HERE!!!    TIPS:  Want this to be voice activated??  If so order an Echo Dot..  I can confirm this will connect with my larger echo and work together meaning it SHOULD also work with the ECHO DOT.. My dot is a few weeks away from being delivered so I will update if this DOES NOT WORK but connected to my ECHO the speaker worked well and the ECHO did the “Always listening” function and played the response out of the TAP    Note:  I will be updating this review as the day/week goes on with photos and updates about how it performs.. I will make note down here when I update and what the update was for.. I am sure I will continue to LOVE this speaker but I wanted to get an initial impression review up while people try to decide if they want the speaker or not!    Update 7/25/16: Still loving the speaker and have owned it for several months now.. it stays in the bottle holder of my day bag most of the time and I carry it with me everywhere.. People always love it when I have it on me! Holding up very well battery life is still great and speaker still looks new! No issues yet ",
"Mitchelle Southern","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I have to say before anything else... STOP LEAVING BAD REVIEWS FOR PRODUCTS BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T READ THE DESCRIPTION CORRECTLY!  I'm sorry, that's my pet peeve and I wish we could leave reviews for reviewers!    Now, on to more important things, like this wonderful AMAZON T A P. Come on people, the name says it all...you have to get off your bum and TAP it to speak to it.  This doesn't make it worth less stars because THAT'S WHAT IT'S MADE TO DO AND IT DOES IT.  Very well, I might add.    There are other options if burning a calorie is too much for you.  You should buy the Echo, or Dot and then you'll be happy!    We were given this as a present and we LOVE it.  Works EXACTLY AS...wait for it...DESCRIBED.  Set up was a breeze.  She has heard everything with ease so far. We've had no issues.  All we've had with it is a great time.  Is it for everyone?  I'd have to say no, because not everyone may have the capability of using it to even 3/4 of its capacity if you don't have/ want Prime or use Spotify or Pandora. But that doesn't mean it doesn't do what is says it does.  Therefore, low reviews for any of these reasons are BAD reviews.    Could there be a lemon out there?  I'm sure..because it's TECHNOLOGY PEOPLE!  Lemons WILL occur! Is it disappointing? For sure! But as long as Amazon makes it right (and I know they will, hence the reason I pay to be a Prime Member) AND it works AS ADVERTISED  (man, there's that phrase again)...then low reviews are what?....say it with me...BAD REVIEWS.  You got it kids!  Good job!    Merry Christmas, ya'll! Go out, and don't be afraid to burn a calorie!  *winks* ",
"Samuel A. Martin","April 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Finally the Tap has been updated with a hands-free mode so you can just say Alexa to activate it.  This can be enabled and disabled in the Alexa app.  Thank you Amazon for making the Tap even better! ",
J.C.M.,"December 26, 2016 ",5.0,"Finally...the update to make this speaker my new favorite of all 3 amazon speakers (tap, echo and dot). I own all 3 and it went from collecting dust to my being my new favorite. The mobility of the device was great but the need to tap it to listen was frustrating but not anymore with the new update.  By going into the settings section of your Alexa app you can turn on the feature to make the Amazon Tap work as the other 2 speakers work by just using the designated wake up word, most commonly used Alexa and now it can finally hear you! Thank you Amazon for bringing this device back from the dead. It makes up for that sly move regarding the (wink wink) limited release and availability of the dot. ",
"Paul Engle","February 9, 2017 ",5.0,"Love this speaker. No, its not the greatest portable speaker. No, it's not the Echo. Don't expect the best of both worlds from one device that's cheaper than either of those products. But this is a solid portable speaker that can also do most everything the echo can do. I would like there to be a little more bass but with a speaker of its size I'm ok with it. Definitely designed for listening while sitting around the house... Not for entertainment and blasting as loud as it can. If you are getting a speaker  solely for the Alexa features go ahead and get the echo. If you're more in to it being a portable boombox then get the UE Boom. If you want a little of both, the Amazon Tap is excellent. ",
Burky,"February 16, 2017 ",5.0,"I have just spent 45min with  the most ridiculous conversation with tech support.  The wifi card in this Tap is clearly defective.  I have 5 echo's with no issues but this tap keeps losing its connection.  They asked me to connect it to my 5G router station and it does not show up as available even though the echo literally two feet away connects along with all of my other devices but they told me to call my ISP...and tell them WHAT?  all my devices work except the tap so what's wrong with my router???  How about a little logic here????  They are refusing help.  I asked to talk to a  supv and they promised a call back within 15min....no call!!!    A few months ago they did  replace the unit and the new one is trouble free plus now having the voice activation makes this the best Echo to have.  I take it on vacation and use it on the deck. ",
"W. Lee","June 23, 2016 ",4.0,"Don't get me wrong. This is a beautiful and well made speaker and the software in the Amazon Tap is great. Where it lacks is the speakers. People stated that the speaker works great... But, I should've listened to the people who said it doesn't...not if you're looking to listen to music in a social setting outdoors. The speakers work flawlessly when playing in either low or mid volume, however, the second you crank the sound up to max, the bass disappears and it becomes a very cheap sounding portable speaker.    The reason why I had purchased this item was because I liked the fact that it had Echo's technology in such a small form factor, but I was also looking for something that had umph when playing music. I was greatly disappointed so much that I had to return the item the same day it arrived. The sound was unsatisfying compared to the UE Boom. If you're looking to play music in an outdoor setting, I would look elsewhere.    I am hoping that Amazon Tap 2 will come out with the fixed speaker issue. When that comes out, I will definitely repurchase the item and give it another go-around. ",
"Amazon Customer","November 8, 2016 ",5.0,"Bottom line, it is all about value in the eyes of the buyer.  I am thoroughly amazed at reviewer comments based on comparisons to professional or more costly sound systems.  If you are a reasonable person and begin with the understanding the Amazon Tap is basically a very well engineered smart Bluetooth speaker system, then you are right where you need to be.  For this buyer, I found this to be a great device.  I own the Amazon Echo, Dot, and now the Tap. The sound is actually much better than I was expecting for the size, and sounds the best of the three.  I also see reviews that say Amazon missed the mark by using a &#34;tap&#34; button to activate voice commands.  I am sure this was a tradeoff for giving the user excellent battery life and as a suggestion to your product managers to further improve this unit, consideration should be given to allowing voice command activation when the unit is in the charger cradle.  Also, maybe a switch that would allow the user to activate voice commands in lieu of the &#34;tap&#34; button should the user not be overly concerned with battery life.  All in all, I am very pleased with the Amazon Tap and found myself taking my Amazon Tap into the garage while working on cars and in the kitchen while trying out a few pots and pans. ",
Angela,"April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"Initially I wondered who would ever own this if they already owned a full-sized Echo. We love our Echo and it is our current source of auditory entertainment while home. Then one night I went to work in my craft room while my husband was watching a show in the living room, where the Echo lives.    Not wanting to interrupt his TV viewing or unplug to move around the Echo I found myself working in a quiet room. I suddenly realized the value of owning an Echo AND a Tap. Since purchasing the Tap I've found it useful in the car (keeps a preschooler very happy on long car drives), while camping, while staying with out-of-town family, while staying in hotels, and when wanting music in any other room in my house besides my Echo. Sure, I mostly use this as a bluetooth speaker for my phone, but as a prime member I do feel that it helps me get more out of my prime membership. Very happy with this purchase. ",
Snowbird,"August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"I bought the Echo first, and I read hundreds of reviews on the Tap before I ordered one. Yes, it's not hands free like the Echo to use Alexa, but that's an easy trade off for the spectacular portability and battery life. If you are like me, you may find that you have a need for both devices in your life. I cannot believe the sound that comes out of this little Tap, it's a powerhouse. I own the Bose Wave and the Bose iPod speakers, but because of the handy and always helpful Alexa I find myself using the Echo and Tap a lot more. Unless you're a big time audiophile, I don't think you will notice that much difference, really. The Echo has a bit more bass than the Tap, but I often use the Tap because it's so portable. I did have a slight problem getting my Tap set up in my wifi, and I had to hold the wifi button for 12 seconds and also reset my router, then it paired nicely with the wifi.    No, the devices don't sync, but I often have them playing in different rooms. If the Tap is on sale, it's a great buy over the Dot, because the speaker is terrific and you would still need a Bluetooth speaker for the Dot.  I use Prime to purchase all kinds of stuff and Alexa deals are truly good buys, so you can use your Tap or Echo to ask Alexa, what are your deals and they usually have some great offerings only available using Alexa.    It's not fair to compare the Tap to the Echo because of the different uses for each.  The volume the Tap puts out is simply amazing for its size. I ordered a silicone cover from Fintie and also a leather cover from them, they're easier to use with the Tap for charging because you can unsnap the bottoms to use on the Tap charger, and theyre  less expensive than the sling Amazon makes.  I also liked their color choices better.    If you're on the fence about getting the Tap, and you want portability from room to room or outside, it's a fine speaker to play music on, plus you get the patient and helpful Alexa! I've been using Prime music and the stations are amazing. I did subscribe to the Echo plan at 3.99/ mo for my Echo, and iI I will certainly get the Music Unlimited for $7.99 now that I have more than one device. I'm glad I ordered the Echo first, but I was pleasantly surprised by the Tap! Fantastic sound for a small device and well worth the money.    I really don't understand all the negative comments about how the Tap is not voice activated, you would think pale would read more about it before they purchase it. It's not an Echo, so don't compare it to that either, but for what it is, it's a great little portable speaker. ",
"Amazon Customer","September 27, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought a Tap because I was so happy with the Echo as well as the Echo Dot.  Both of these work flawlessly in my home. The Tap...well this is a horse of a different color.  Let me explain to you what I mean.  I set up the Tap and it seemed to work fine; however, next time I tried to use it, it had disconnected from the Internet, and I had to reconnect it.  This seemed odd as this never happened with either the Echo or Echo Dot. This same behavior, however, continued.  Every time I tried to use the Tap, I had to reconnect it to my Wi-Fi.  This was extremely annoying as you can imagine if every time you tried to use any of your &#34;smart&#34; electronic devices, you had to reconnect it to your Wi-Fi.  So I called Amazon (boy, what a headache just to find out how even to reach their Tap support) and explained this odd behavior to one of Amazon's tech support people.  She told me the problem was that the Tap, unlike the Echo, was only designed for a single band Wi-Fi so unless I split my Wi-Fi router's 2.4 and 5 GHz bands and gave them each a different password and then connect the Tap only to the 2.4 GHz band, the Tap will always disconnect from the 2.4 GHz band!  I thought that this tech support person was pulling my leg, as I must have 25 or 30 &#34;smart&#34; devices in my home--from a Roku, to Kindles, to IPads, IPhones, Fires, TVs, blu-ray players, etc. connected to my Apple Airport Extreme and not one of them exhibits this wonky behavior. So I asked to speak to a supervisor--and the Tap tech support supervisor confirmed her statement!  I could not run the Tap on a double band router without having to  reconnect it to my Wi-Fi with each use as it would be &#34;confused&#34; by receiving the double band router signal!  Honestly, I am NOT an electronics expert by any measure, but it makes no sense as to why something designed only for a 2;4 GHz signal would disconnect from it and then try unsuccessfully to connect to a 5 GHz signal to which it is not even designed to connect, so it anyone out there can explain this, please do so. But that is the story Amazon is sticking to: either I buy a single band router, or split my double band router into two signals--each with separate password, or return the Tap--which is what I am doing.  I must add that the supervisor could not have been nicer in offering full a full refund for the Tap--including $20 for the third party cover I purchased through Amazon for the Tap. So, I would give Amazon 5 stars for that if I could. But this is a product review, and if what Amazon's Tap support is telling me is true, I would give the Tap ZERO stars if I could.  What....Amazon does not realize that people have dual band routers and that I, like am sure many dual band router owners, don't split their router signals and give separate password to each band?  I still do not understand why I cannot run the Tap with my Apple Airport Extreme router, but this--folks--is the story of my experience with Amazon's Tap. I originally just felt I received a defective Tap, despite what I am being told by Amazon's Tap support. The Echo and Echo Dot---love them,,,,however, the Tap...well for me it was just one big headache and if what Amazon's support says is true, they should go back to the drawing board with this turkey!!!  Amazon should rename the Tap the Dud! ",
MJDoe,"November 20, 2016 ",5.0,"My husband has been so happy for his Alexa! He has laughed, use it for our Grandson Joseph who is home schooled. He teaches every Thursday and Joseph and Bumpa use it for everything. Alexa tells jokes, and if she is told she Say ( THAT'S Not VERY NICE).  Knock Knock Jokes, plays Irish songs with a Gaelic Accent Every person who enters our home has to use it ",
Amber,"May 15, 2016 ",1.0,"I was a little apprehensive about purchasing this at first. It's pretty expensive for a Bluetooth player but it was on sale for a short time and I just went ahead and got it. It's actually pretty cool. Setting up the Bluetooth and the connection to the wifi is super easy. It walks you through everything. It is different from the Echo in that you have to tap the button to control it. So if you're telling Alexa to turn the volume down you may as well just tap the volume button. You can set it up through the Alexa app to access your Spotify and other accounts you might have. You can also control the music play through the Alexa app. The sound quality is really great. We have a sectional with wooden shelves in the corner so it sits on its charger right there. The charger is pretty neat though because it I want to grab it and take it upstairs or in another room I don't have to mess around with cords. I've used it to listen to my music, the radio, and books. You can also ask it sports info like when your favorite team plays next. I like that it's super user friendly but if I had to change one thing I wish you didn't have to push the button. I just didn't need the home automation that comes with the Echo. I do like that they're constantly adding things Alexa can do. Happy with my purchase. ",
Roger,"February 3, 2017 ",5.0,"I love my Amazon Echo so much it only made sense to buy the tap which is portable.  I couldn't believe that the tap battery last 9 hr on a single charge.  My tap controls my living room lights with the help of TP Link wi-Fi power plug. wi-Fi power plug.  I'm an iPhone user and there's no comparison between Amazons Alexa and Apple's Siri.  If Amazon would come out with a new phone with Alexa I would drop my iPhone in a heartbeat. ",
"Andrew V.","October 19, 2016 ",5.0,"I've had this for maybe around half a year now. I don't use it to it's full potential, like alarm clocks, online ordering, etc. I've used it mostly for Pandora and weather, and I just got Prime Music but I'm still trying that out. Slightly bigger than my average small hands.    If you want to skip the pros and cons, the bottom line is I would recommend.    Pros:  -The sound quality is pretty good for a speaker this size. The volume packs a punch, so for the most part I keep the volume at 2-6 which volume 5-6 fills up a bedroom/living room really well imo.  -The 360 degree sound is actually quite nice and I didn't realize how much I appreciated it. The speaker can be placed in the middle of the room and reachable by anyone instead of in a corner.  -Since I first got it, the Alexa app has gotten considerably better. I didn't use it back then because it was so buggy. There are a lot of nice features in the app though, like making sure the speaker is understanding what you're saying to it.  -Portability! I've actually brought it around with me a lot and it has been a great additional background music during house cleaning and small house parties when we have guests. It has a small footprint if that matters to you.  -Wireless charging stand is a nice addition. Charges pretty fast too through the direct cable or with the charging stand.  -Not quite sure about the 9 hours of music, but it has lasted me pretty long on one charge during a day's cleaning.    Cons:  -Sound quality distorts around volume 7-8 and above, and the highs become really strong and the bass disappears.  -The speaker still has some trouble understanding me, and sometimes it doesn't register what I said the first time and I have to speak more clearly. This could probably be improved with the app, but I haven't been bothered enough by it to try the app again.  -Not water/dust-resistant. Careful by the garage doing work and the kitchen sink while doing dishes.  -I'm not a Bluetooth expert, but I believe the connectivity is NOT 4.0, because there's an obvious latency/delay through Bluetooth... AND the aux. (To my understanding 4.0 has a small latency that is undetectable to the ears.) I was super confused why there was a delay when I had my speaker directly connected to my computer by aux cord. But I checked my cables and other speakers and made sure it wasn't anything else other than the speaker. This definitely keeps it from being a 5 star for me because you can't connect this to your computer/laptop and watch movies on it or something. The delay is pretty annoying and I couldn't handle watching YouTube or any kind of videos with the Tap. Nowhere on the Amazon Tap info does it claim to have bluetooth 4.0 or apx-t, to be fair. I just wasn't expecting the direct 3.5mm input to have delay as well. This was the most disappointing thing for me, probably because I was hoping to use this as a computer speaker as well.    Other thoughts:  -I thought that since I have to press the mic button in the middle to talk to it that it'd be a hassle compared to just being able to talk to Alexa on the Echo, but it's really not. It's not like I'm glued to the sofa or my desk or that it's more than an arm's reach away and I can't do anything about it.  -Also, I never realized how convenient it was for a speaker to have compatibility through wifi to stream music. Instead of going to my phone/device to bluetooth-connect the Tap and play music, like most people the Tap is probably in a home or somewhere with wifi that you can just play music on Pandora or some other program without checking your phone to change songs and stuff. Since I really just listen to Pandora and I don't have premium Spotify and used to not have Prime Music, I got used to listening to new artists and music instead of making playlists.  -If you're looking for a high quality bluetooth speaker at this $80-120 price range and really need the bass to be in your music, there are better options at this price and even lower. The bass isn't that great with the Tap at all levels of volume, but balanced enough at the lower levels. But for the wifi connection and Alexa talking back on the Tap, the price vs features is pretty good. ",

"Brad and Sam","November 26, 2016 ",4.0,"I have had my Amazon Tap speaker for almost a month and I really can't find much to complain about. At first I was skeptical as to whether it was worth the price, but after trying other bluetooth speakers I can safely say that my Tap has the best sound quality of anything that I have tried. I also love the versatility and portability of this Alexa-enabled speaker. It is so much more than just a speaker. When you are connected to the Internet, I find it very handy to use the tap button to get a news flash or weather forecast. It is also simple to stream your Pandora, i heart , spotify, tune in, kindle, or audible via bluetooth from another device.  The Tap can be charged with the included charging station or by connecting a micro usb directly.  I was also impressed with the battery life. The Tap works great for streaming music from my phone when I am out on the lake in our boat. My kids love asking it to play silly songs like Old McDonald Had A Farm.  We have a LED projector and use our Tap for better sound quality during our family movie nights. You just need to connect it to the projector with an auxillary audio cable. I am very satisfied with my purchase.    Only dislike is,  I do wish it had a (always listing mode) like the echo,  maybe only when it was in the charger base.  Hopefully this might come in a firmware update.  But, I'm not going to dock a star becos it don't do something it never claimed to. ",

"Mr. Jon P. Gill","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"Being an Amazon Echo device owner for over a year now, I decided to venture into the more mobile capabilities of the tap and dot for the holidays. The experience with the tap left me a bit underwhelmed overall. One of the first things I noticed was that I underestimated just how much of a useful feature voice activation is. Having to tap the button on the front of the unit or on the accessory control before voice commands quickly became a bother for my common day to day Alexa queries and commands.    In addition, though I was not expecting miracles by any means, the speaker, and more importantly the inability of this device to connect to another Bluetooth speaker, made using the device and showing it off to family less than incredible. I am perplexed at what the use case for this unit is over the dot and full featured Echo offerings. It is more expensive than the dot, unable to connect to external Bluetooth devices, and has no voice activated features; opting instead to manual controls for commands.    Alexa still will remain a staple of my home but this device does not do her justice. In the end, I returned the unit and decided to go with the Echo Dot instead. I think that while the technology in this device is quite impressive, the features limitations of this unit as a delivery method for the Alexa service is underwhelming. If it was able to connect to a Bluetooth speaker, had the option of voice activated services over a hardware button only control (perhaps all the units should have both hardware or listening options), or it simply was a better standalone Bluetooth speaker on par with speakers in its price category, I think it would sit better for me. As it stands, the Tap does not represent the Alexa services in a way that I am proud to showcase. ",
greeneyedlady,"August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS!  My fiancee and the poker crowd love it too!  I use this outside my house around the bonfire on weekends (within WIFI range) and we jam all night to anything we ask her for.  I have playlists I made of different genres or you can simply ask Alexa to play Disco, Rock, 70s, 80s whatever and she will.  REALLY COOL!  I keep this one in my Bedroom and I listen to the Bible App at night, Alexa will read whatever Book, chapter, verse or you can even do a 21 day Bible reading program. Never read the entire Bible .  Spent most of my early life in bars and with the band so, at 47, I figured it was time .  You can listen in the tub--another favorite of mine since that is the only place I truly have any peace and quiet all day.  This is exactly what I wanted.  The Echo stays in one place but the Tap goes with me everywhere. Does everything her big sister does AND goes mobile!!  COOOOOOOL!! ",
Vargr,"January 10, 2017 ",3.0,"I am incredibly impressed with the Tap.      The sound, while not &#34;bass heavy&#34; is definitely on par with other speakers in it's price range, and significantly better than those below it.    The main thing you're paying for, however, is the Alexa function, which is amazing. I do wish it had an &#34;active mode&#34; where you could use it just like the echo and didn't have to press the speech button, but that's a picky complaint. I'm very very happy with the tap, as both an Alexa device and a portable speaker.    Pros:    The sound is incredible, it certainly fills a room, and often a little more.  Alexa, being tied into the servers makes the Tap very cook, I enjoy being able to just tap the button and speak &#34;play so-and-so&#34; then have it do as commanded. Amazon does need to improve their database interaction though.  The phone app, the Alexa app does a great job at making your phone a media controller, from shuffling, skipping, selecting, and rating your songs, it can be done right there in your hand from any room as long as you're on wifi with your tap.    Cons:    A little more bass would be nice, not really much of a con though imo.  No &#34;Listening mode&#34;, I do wish it had something like this.  Condom, I feel like for the price, Amazon should have included the gel sling with the tap, frankly. I'm getting really tired of paying far more than the manufacturing cost for electronics, just to get hit with a 2000% marked-up, necessary peripheral as well. Seriously, my Note 4 is a grand and you can't throw in a 2$ shell, you have to make me pay 40$s for it? Same thing here, the Alexa did not cost amazon 100$s to manufacture, the gel sling is not really worth 20$s, but you need it if you're going to port the tap around.    That's about it, if you're looking for a portable Echo, get it, if you're looking for an interactive bluetooth speaker, look no further, if you're looking for a fun new addition to your tech array and think the tap might fit the bill, just do it.    5 stars here, thanks Amazon.

"Roger James","March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"I like the Tap a lot;. It fills in the gap between the Echo and the Dot. We have several Echo's in multiple rooms and other rooms have Dot's. These all work very well and are fun to use and find many useful roles with new ones always being discovered. If you already own one, you know what I mean.  My wife asked why another device that won't automatically respond to voice commands. I said bring out one of the Dot's or Echo's outside or in the porch. (can't be done...no power there)! That is why I bought the Tap. I can bring it anywhere where there is at least some wifi signal and it will  respond to questions, play music or do what we want at the touch of a button. No cord to plug in and its very comfortable to hold and carry around.    The design is perfect for portability. The sound is very good too. I think the idea of ON/OFF switch is perfect. Sometimes it's great not having the  device go off when it thinks it's heard her name. from a distance. We can't shout out Alexa  too loud in the house because the mike's are quite sensitive and several can go off together and that is quite weird when it happens. This is the only product that is portable and it works well and holds the charge for a long time. I haven't tested  how long but charging in the cradle is easy and not too much of a challenge. This isn't the best first Echo to purchase but if you want portability, it's a great choice. and a good buy..    . ",
"Alex M.","June 28, 2016 ",5.0,"I received it as a gift from a friend. It is helpful and cool to use it, especially with the new feature of always listening (enabled in the app) so that you don't have to tap it for a command.  The reason I am writing this review is for the Amazon Tap and Logitech Harmony Hub connectivity.  I searched online to see if this is possible, to use Alexa voice commands to operate the Logitech Harmony Hub and I could not find anything.  Most reviewers (if not all) were using the Echo Dot to voice control the Harmony Hub and some explained the connection as a direct Bluetooth connection between the two devices. Since the Amazon Tap only accepts Bluetooth as an input, but not as a communication feature I was not sure if this will work with the Harmony Hub. Guess what? It works!!! So any Alexa enabled device will work with the Logitech Harmony Hub in my opinion, but it is not advertised as such. How it works? The reason it works is that the two devices are NOT connecting directly but trough Amazon and respectively Logitech servers. Amazon Tap once connected to wi-fi will be connected to your Amazon account and the Amazon servers. The Logitech Harmony Hub once connected to wi-fi will ask you to create an account with Logitech and you'll be connected to Logitech servers. Then in the Alexa app go to Skills and search for Harmony and install the skills. This will link the accounts you have with Amazon and Logitech together and therefore no need for direct device to device connection. This way ANY Alexa device will be able to control your Logitech Harmony Hub.  I hope this will help some of you, I wish I had this info a week ago, but could not find it anywhere and so I decided to experiment.  Good luck!! ",
"T. Truong","January 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I've had my Tap for a little under two years. For the first year - it worked fine. I also have an Echo. Both worked fine. About the middle of 2016 - all these little annoying glitches started appearing. First - the audio now has a very frequent skipping and pops. And when you press Forward or Backwards while listening to music; you get a really jarring blast of static and feedback. It sounds like when you jump ahead to the next song on an old fashioned turntable. It never used to do this. But since it started happening - it's been consistent. Press Forward/Backwards; ugly burst of cracking audio.    Then now just yesterday - the Tap suddenly decide it would go from 100% charged - to 0%; just because I had the nerve to unplug it from the power socket and move it to a new location. Since then - it refuses to charge.    So hopefully - you recent buyers aren't experiencing this. But I personally would have given the Tap a FIVE STARS if I had done my review in 2015. Now I can only give it TWO STARS. Because although you can say the glitches aren't bad; they're obvious glitches that I refuse to believe no one at Amazon has caught; or has already fixed. I went on the forums and the power glitch has been happening frequently since the beginning of 2016! There's a whole forum thread about it. Inexcusable. ",
"Tex S.","March 8, 2017 ",5.0,"UPDATED 3/18/17  Amazon released an update a couple weeks ago that fixes my only real gripe with this product. Now you can go into the Settings menu of the Alexa app, click on your Tap, and enable &#34;always listening&#34; mode. No longer must you tap the microphone button to activate Alexa! In my opinion this is THE Echo device to get! You get an always-listening Alexa, and a high-quality bluetooth or wifi speaker. Every day my wife takes this into the backyard while the kids play and they can listen to kids music or my wife can turn on iHeartRadio.    My original review is preserved below:    Amazon desperately needs to release a software update that allows Tap to listen while it's in the charging cradle. Having to &#34;tap&#34; removes most of the utility of Alexa. I can't just say &#34;Alexa, order more olive oil&#34; while I'm cooking and run out, or I can't say &#34;Alexa, turn on front porch light&#34; if I'm sitting on the couch and my dog starts barking like crazy. Yeah, I'm lazy, but Alexa is the manifestation of modern-day laziness -- so, Amazon, manifest my laziness or this is just a really expensive bluetooth/wifi-combo speaker! I can't even &#34;tap&#34; from the app on my smartphone! I have to -- wait for it -- get out of my chair, and walk over to it, and press a button! So much easier to just use my smartphone in one hand and hold my beer in the other.    The only real positive to requiring a tap while plugged in, is that my kids have to be able to reach it to ask Alexa to &#34;play Bubble Guppies&#34; or other silly things.    As far as quality goes, it's a pretty dang good speaker. This is close to but not quite as good as the Sonos Play 1 when it comes to music. This is basically what I wanted out of the Sonos Play 1 -- battery, bluetooth AND wifi -- and why I returned that device. I just wish it listened and I could fully control or &#34;tap&#34; it from my phone. ",

Kenya,"June 15, 2016 ",5.0,"A complete waste. This would be maybe a $15 bluetooth speaker. It's not actually portable, it can only move from room to room. To take it anywhere else, you need to have it linked to a device that's connected both to wireless AND to bluetooth. How long do you think your phone's battery will last while it's simultaneously downstreaming music AND sending it to this device via bluetooth?    The idea that you &#34;tap&#34; this speaker is grossly misleading. No, you don't tap it; tapping would be simple, easy. Instead, you press a button. The button is not convenient, not intelligently integrated into the device; it's on one side. If you're cooking or working in the garage or having conversations with friends, you want to be able to listen to music or ask Alexa for information without taking your eyes away from your work. That is not possible with this speaker. It is not possible with this speaker. You have to look away from whatever you're doing, locate the poorly designed button, reach around or bend over, squeeze it and hope it registered the button push.    &#34;Ah, but isn't that how most bluetooth speakers work?&#34; Only in theory. I have four, from four different companies, and all of them, if you reach over and press them, will usually stop. The tap requires more of your focus and your energy. The design team behind this product should be fired. ",
Justin,"December 5, 2016 ",1.0,"Pros: Battery Life, Alexa, Line-In and Bluetooth connectivity.    Cons: Sound quality    I am going to start by saying that when compared to even the full echo quality is not as good. I have a few cheaper Bluetooth speaker only devices that also sound better. I think it is great for things like talk radio or comedy albums but it is lacking in range. Sound is a little washed out overall but for a portable speaker it is decent. If you compare it to other speakers in the same price range it is not on par but this isn't just a speaker. If you are looking for a great Bluetooth speaker in the same price range I would honestly look elsewhere but if you want Alexa and all of the voice integration that is where the Tap shines.    I take my Tap too and from work every day and usually on lunch I will listen to my flash briefing or a few comedy albums I have in my library. I also take my Tap all over my house and out into the garage, I enjoy being able to control my smart home devices from anywhere in WiFi range and since it has the same skills as a full size echo I don't miss anything that I am used to doing with my hard wired Echo and Dots.    One of my favorite uses though is when I am traveling or just on the go I use the tap as a speaker for my laptop. This allows me to stream movies with a little better sound than the built in speakers. In a world where everything is wireless it is nice to see that they left the audio jack on the device. I do wish that they would allow to choose if Alexa is disabled or not. When I have it plugged into my laptop it would be nice to listen to flash briefing without unplugging it first. Since I can stream the same library from Amazon and most other apps though this is by no means a deal breaker.    One other feature that would push this to a 5 star rating would be speaker phone support. If it would allow the Bluetooth connection to do more than just audio I could remove a device from my bag. Right now I still have to carry a small speaker that works well for phone calls and conferences and such. ",
Slyeclover1988,"April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"The Amazon tap when I first purchased it was not what I had expected with no hands free capabilities as far as voice recognition.  So it's safe to say I was not a fan at first, but now with the capability to go hands free and  I don't have to press a button every time I need to ask a question or place an order.  This product is very similar to the echo dot  except taller and bulkier, but I believe the sound quality to be better on the Amazon tap.  I enjoy loud music so I was pleased when the max volume is very loud and clear which is hard to do in most Bluetooth speakers.  The battery life lasts for several hours fully charged unless I have the volume to a high level.  You cannot go wrong with this product if your in the market for a Bluetooth speaker to use at home, or even outside I just would not get it wet. ",
"Bruce Huttner","August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"Was a little reluctant to jump on the Alexa train, but I'm glad I did.  When my old UE Boom portable Bluetooth speaker died, I decided to give the Tap a try.  It is less expensive than the Boom, and the Tap's charging port is a great improvement over the Boom.  No need to fuss w an annoying USB plug every time you move the speaker! Nice!    To be sure, the sound is not as good as my old UE Boom, but for casual listening on the deck, it's fine. I'm a bit of an audiophile, but have fairly modest expectations for a small portable speaker such as this. The Boom is an excellent Bluetooth speaker. The Tap is a &#34;good&#34; one. The added convenience and features that Alexa brings to the table on the Tap makes that trade-off in sound quality worthwhile.    So, what about Alexa? I had my doubts, but I like her.  It's nice to have a hand free timer at my disposal in the kitchen.  It's also nice being able to tell Alexa to &#34;play NPR&#34; or to play music by a particular artist, or genre. I like being able to control my Nest thermostat from Alexa. Now if I could only get the damn thing to play nice w my Harmony Remote, I'd be considering a 5 star rating! ",
"Susan S.","March 30, 2017 ",4.0,"I have the Tap and two Amazon Echo Dots.  I got the Tap first and liked its sound and capabilities.  After I got my first Dot, however, I found I much preferred using the &#34;Alexa&#34; wake word rather than having to press a button, so the Tap languished.  I actually tried to pair the Echo Dot and the Tap so that I could marry the great sound of the Tap and the always-listening Dot.  I couldn't get it to work and don't think it's possible.  So to enhance the sound of the Dots, I bought compatible Jet speakers and hardly used the Tap anymore. Suffice it to say I was very pleased to receive an email that the Tap now offers a hands-free option. As a software update - for free!  Using the updated Alexa app on your mobile device, you can now turn on the hands-free mode wherein you need only say &#34;Alexa&#34; for your Tap to spring to life just like the Echo and Echo Dot do. (This can also be turned off if you so desire.)  My  formerly neglected Tap has a new lease on life! Thank you, Amazon, for the free upgrade!  What a great gift to your Tap customers! ",
Jonathan,"April 29, 2017 ",4.0,"This speaker is nice and has a good stand by battery. It works similar to the Echo unit that I have, but does not require the use of saying &#34;Alexa/Echo&#34;. Rather, you press the button on the front of the speaker and give the demands that way. The sound is nicely balanced, but does lack some of the bass that is present in speakers in this price range. I've also purchased the Fabriq speaker, which is $50, and that speaker is not as loud, but definitely contains a more bass heavy sound (along with LED lights on the bottom). I also have the protective cover that Amazon makes for this speaker and while it does provide an easy handle/hook and protection, the bottom of the cover does not allow for one to take advantage of the wireless charger this is provided with the unit. Rather, you will have to plug in the unit each time that charging is required. For music, movie watching and everyday use, this product is perfect, but it will not provided enough sound to fill a large room or party. For its size, it is a solid unit with lots of capabilities that are not found on the traditional Bluetooth speaker. ",

"Sarasota Suncoast Reviewer","January 12, 2017 ",4.0,"I love my Echo - love love love it!  The Amazon Tap feels like the musical extension of the Echo.  While it isn't voice activated YET (I expect that sometime in the future this may be avaialbe) it is easy to use by &#34;tapping&#34; the mic button on the front of the device.    Great hi-fi sound for such a little device.  While I expected the unit to be about as big as an Echo it is not.  I compare the sizes this way:  the Echo is about the size of a can of tennis balls and the Tap is about the size of a can of racquetballs.  A mini version.    Directions were good and clear and setting up the Tap was easy peasy (especially if you are accustomed to the Echo).  I like the tray charger but when I bought a sling, it doesn't make using the tray charger possible without taking off the sling.  Since I am not going to dress and undress the Tap that often, I charge the unit by plugging the mini USB plug directly into the Tap.  The little tray charger is pretty cool though - sit it on there naked and it will charge without plugging anything into the Tap.    Am truly enjoying this little device with the big sound.  Quite happy, actually :) ",
BKinder,"December 25, 2016 ",1.0,"We have the Echo and have been more than happy with it, but I was looking for a portable speaker to use in hockey locker rooms and out in the yard while working, etc., so I decided to try the Tap. I don't use the Alexa capabilities like I do with my Echo, but I still love the speaker.    Likes:  Great sound for a little speaker  Easy to pair with phone  Charger disc is nice. Just set Tap on top and it charges, no cable connection needed.  Battery has good life  Size - roughly the size of a tall boy    Dislikes:  If you use a protective sling cover, you lose the ability to charge on the disc and have to plug the Tap in.    As long as you aren't expecting big, powerful audio from this little thing, you should be happy. ",
SoCalJim,"July 20, 2016 ",5.0,"We bought this for our 10 year  old son for Christmas and he loves it.  Initially we were planning on buying a simple bluetooth speaker, but after reading the reviews and the functionality of the tap, we decided it was a much than a speaker for a little more money.  He absolutely loves it.,the sound quality of the speaker is excellent., and through the Alexa app it can be connected directly to WIFI so it doesn't need to be paired to a phone or tablet to play music.  The speaker is loud and provides sufficient bass for a speaker of its size.    In addition, It allows him to play music from both Pandora and Amazon Prime Music, as well as use it to set a sleep timer or wake alarm.  Alexa also answers questions. provides sports updates, or weather updates, as well as much much more.  We are always learning new things that the Alexa can do.  I do recommend adding a pin code in the app to purchases if you have kids, so they cannot order through Alexa without approval.  Also the Alexa app records all of the voice requests so you know what interactions have occurred.  I must admit I am a little jealous and will most likely be picking one up for me in the future.  This is an excellent product...  Amazon did it again. ",

"Kevin M.","August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"I own 2 Amazon Echos and 1 Amazon TAP.  I've gifted an Echo and 2 TAPs to family members.  They are amazing devices!  I was one of the first to get the Amazon Echo back when it was &#34;by invitation only&#34;.  I've automated the lights and thermostat in my house so I can control them via Alexa.  The echo had me hooked, and then Amazon announced the TAP.  I take the TAP to work, on vacation & business trips.  I love the convenience of being able to take it to the back yard if I wish to listen to my audio books or music while relaxing outside.    The speaker in the Echo is obviously much better than in the TAP because of it's size, but the TAP's speaker sounds great until you get it topped out, then you lose any quality low end audio, although I've yet to experience any distortion. The battery life on the Amazon TAP is excellent. I love having control of my lights and home environment through my NEST thermostat by simply stating a command in to my Echo or Amazon TAP no matter where I am in the world.    I highly recommend the Amazon Echo and TAP.  It really does make your life more comfortable. ",

Andy,"July 14, 2016 ",5.0,"Here is a short summary - good speaker, I bought it to play music outside (on my patio). I love the fact that it's a wifi speaker - so it's not dependent on my phone.    I'm sure you've had someone be the &#34;DJ&#34;, and the music stops because they got a phone call, or they walk away and the music starts skipping. Not an issue with the tap.    The bass could be stronger, but the quality is definitely nice and it gets loud enough for my needs.    ***UPDATE - 4/12/2017***  My Tap speaker is still in wonderful working condition - even though I left it out in the rain for 1-2 nights.

"Joe P.","February 3, 2017 ",5.0,"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!!  LOL  So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT&#34;S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that  Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!! ",
"K. Harrison","May 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Now that the need to press (&#34;tap&#34;) a button in order to interact with the device has been eliminated,  this is almost the perfect little Echo.    It sounds great,  and love the fact that it's battery powered and very portable. It competes nicely against other portable bluetooth speakers,  but it has the added benefit of full Amazon Echo integration.    If the original,  full size Echo is a 10 in terms of sound quality,  I'd give te Tap about an 8.5.  For comparison purposes,  I'd rate the Echo Dot about a 2. I would never use it to play music unless it was connected to external speakers.    My one gripe is that I wish there was a way to turn off the confirmation chime that it makes when you say the wake word. I have that turned off on the Echo and Dot,  but haven't found a way to turn it off on the Tap. It annoys me.  When they do that, its perfect. ",
"Andrew Bohn","December 9, 2016 ",5.0,"[Update 12/2016 - 4 stars] The previously mentioned issues with Bluetooth connectivity have disappeared and stayed gone for months now.  I'm not sure if Tap updated itself silently with a fix (if so, cool!) or upgrading my phone to Galaxy S7 was the answer but now Bluetooth works flawlessly.  I've also paired it to my Surface Pro 3 with outstanding results.  Living with the Tap for the last 7 months I've found that I now use it more than the Echo. While the sound quality is distinctly inferior to the Echo it is still passable and the portability is highly addictive.  This device has been used almost every day since we bought it and has become an indispensable addition to my gadget cadre.  My only issue now is around Prime music and the inability for multiple devices to stream concurrently.  I hope the Prime team figures out a useful solution for the many issues plaguing Prime membership and multi-member households (i.e. families).    [Original 5/2016 - 2 stars] If the Tap is in the same family as our Echo, it was clearly adopted.  I really really wanted to love this device.  Our family have been fans of the Echo since we participated in the early adopter program.  As great a device as the Echo is, this device is deeply disappointing.  Our daughter went off to college and left he Bose Soundlink behind accidentally.  While she was gone I made great use of that device.  She came home, saw her Bose and all of a sudden I was in trouble.  I decided to give the Amazon Tap a chance since our Echo is so awesome.  Our Echo has deep rich sound, as did the Bose Soundlink.  The Tap does not.  Many other reviewers have mentioned this deficiency and still others have denounced them.  Trust me – you will not get the same rich sound from the Tap.  Passable but definitely not excellent and certainly not even close to the Bose.  As mediocre as the sound is, I was willing to live with it until I took it on the road.  I travel regularly for work and became quite addicted to the Bose paired over Bluetooth while in my hotel room(s).  The Tap gets zero stars for this use case, negative one actually.  With the device paired over Bluetooth it would inexplicably just stop making sound after 15-20 minutes.  The phone showed Bluetooth was still paired and switching off Bluetooth on the phone would cause the sound to come out of my phone but not the tap.  After fighting through several permutations of power off, unpair, repair etc. I was eventually able to get another 20 minutes or so of sound before the Tap decided I’d had enough.  I ended up grabbing an audio cable and connecting the phone to the Tap.  Solved the problem but definitely not even close to optimal.  I never experienced anything like this with the Bose in hundreds of uses.  F.  Unlike the Bose, the Tap also does not appear to be very compatible with a moist environment such as a drizzly day outside or a steamy bathroom or a day out on the lake.  The product page has a table comparing the Tap to other Bluetooth speakers (such as the Bose) but the table is misleading.  It is true that as a standalone device the Tap offers more than the other devices, but pair the other devices to your phone and almost all of those ‘no’ boxes turn to yes and then some while your Tap will be sitting silent staring at you for being a sucker and not buying the Bose.  I would return it if we hadn’t thrown away all the packing material. ",

"Amazon Customer","May 22, 2016 ",4.0,"I bought a Tap because I was so happy with the Echo as well as the Echo Dot.  Both of these work flawlessly in my home. The Tap...well this is a horse of a different color.  Let me explain to you what I mean.  I set up the Tap and it seemed to work fine; however, next time I tried to use it, it had disconnected from the Internet, and I had to reconnect it.  This seemed odd as this never happened with either the Echo or Echo Dot. This same behavior, however, continued.  Every time I tried to use the Tap, I had to reconnect it to my Wi-Fi.  This was extremely annoying as you can imagine if every time you tried to use any of your &#34;smart&#34; electronic devices, you had to reconnect it to your Wi-Fi.  So I called Amazon (boy, what a headache just to find out how even to reach their Tap support) and explained this odd behavior to one of Amazon's tech support people.  She told me the problem was that the Tap, unlike the Echo, was only designed for a single band Wi-Fi so unless I split my Wi-Fi router's 2.4 and 5 GHz bands and gave them each a different password and then connect the Tap only to the 2.4 GHz band, the Tap will always disconnect from the 2.4 GHz band!  I thought that this tech support person was pulling my leg, as I must have 25 or 30 &#34;smart&#34; devices in my home--from a Roku, to Kindles, to IPads, IPhones, Fires, TVs, blu-ray players, etc. connected to my Apple Airport Extreme and not one of them exhibits this wonky behavior. So I asked to speak to a supervisor--and the Tap tech support supervisor confirmed her statement!  I could not run the Tap on a double band router without having to  reconnect it to my Wi-Fi with each use as it would be &#34;confused&#34; by receiving the double band router signal!  Honestly, I am NOT an electronics expert by any measure, but it makes no sense as to why something designed only for a 2;4 GHz signal would disconnect from it and then try unsuccessfully to connect to a 5 GHz signal to which it is not even designed to connect, so it anyone out there can explain this, please do so. But that is the story Amazon is sticking to: either I buy a single band router, or split my double band router into two signals--each with separate password, or return the Tap--which is what I am doing.  I must add that the supervisor could not have been nicer in offering full a full refund for the Tap--including $20 for the third party cover I purchased through Amazon for the Tap. So, I would give Amazon 5 stars for that if I could. But this is a product review, and if what Amazon's Tap support is telling me is true, I would give the Tap ZERO stars if I could.  What....Amazon does not realize that people have dual band routers and that I, like am sure many dual band router owners, don't split their router signals and give separate password to each band?  I still do not understand why I cannot run the Tap with my Apple Airport Extreme router, but this--folks--is the story of my experience with Amazon's Tap. I originally just felt I received a defective Tap, despite what I am being told by Amazon's Tap support. The Echo and Echo Dot---love them,,,,however, the Tap...well for me it was just one big headache and if what Amazon's support says is true, they should go back to the drawing board with this turkey!!!  Amazon should rename the Tap the Dud! ",
"Matthew Thacker","June 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I was so excited about the Tap. It has great sound and holds a charge for a good while. I love the charging base so the thing doesn't have to be plugged in. The ability to carry it around and use bluetooth, wifi, and Alexa seemed like the perfect little speaker.  However, this thing had been the bane of my existence since day one. At first we couldn't get it connected to the wifi. The same wifi our phones, apple TVs, and echo use. Once we finally got it connected I thought, well thats done now I can just use it cause surely the thing will remember our network.  Nope. It will not stay connected to the wifi. The Alexa app is HORRIBLE. Unfortunately it's the only way to setup the Tap so everytime the thing disconnects, I have to go into the app, which crashes 4 out of 5xs, to try and get it to see the wifi that my echo has never disconnected from in the 4 months that we've had it. This is not a wifi problem or a user error problem. This is a product problem. I'm not sure if it's the app or the Tap or both but I'm about 1 wk from returning this thing. Amazon, you guys need to get it together! You still those things for a good chunk of change and then make it so frustrating to use. I love my echo. Tap, well I couldn't tell you bc most of the time I've had it it's been in setup mode with an app that won't load. I would NOT buy this again and will not recommend it to anyone until Amazon fixes the app and the connectivity problems. ",
"J. Bonanno","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"Had it for 24 hours and first impression is that it does everything pretty well, but nothing exceptionally well. The speaker quality is okay, but not amazing.

What is going on with the usb outlet adapter. The thing is almost 2&#34; long. Designers at Apple lose their jobs for such sloppiness and those at Amazon lose limbs (or so I've heard). I assume this abomination will result many employees walking around the campus without various arms and legs and I can't say it's not been earned. Shame on them. ",

I am very happy with this device as it provides the portability that my other Echo devices do not. Sound is great for such a small device and since Amazon added the voice activation feature I rate it a solid five stars! The voice activation is supposed to reduce the battery life, but I've used it for several hours off of the charging cradle, and it has yet to run out of power.

jelz,"August 11, 2016 ",4.0,"The amazon TAP is my go-to device. For playing music for everything...I use it every night to fall asleep to my &quot;sleep sounds&quot; app. I connect with bluetooth  to my iPhone, then I use my sleep app that plays sleep sounds.  I also use it when we go to the pool for music...all you have to do is ask Alexa to play anything for example, &quot;play Top pop, country etc. on Prime music&quot; and she will play it. It has so many options. It's small compact, and easy to tote around. You can ask it to give you today's briefings...weather tell it to sing to you tell you a joke. (my kids love that option). We bring it to Football practice.  The battery charger dock is unique and useful, I prefer it over a plug in battery charger.  Great gift for someone too with the holidays around the corner! ",
ic4llshotgun,"April 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I like the Tap because it eliminates my two biggest gripes with the original Echo - no internal battery, thus NO portability, and no headphone jack.  With the battery feature, you have to press a button to talk to Alexa instead of saying her wake word since her always-listening function would drain the battery, but I have the regular Echo for that function anyway.  I have never had issues with the battery or Wifi range.  Fidelity feels on par with what you should expect from the power / impedance requirements the device is aiming for.  It shot that middle range just fine - these aren't studio monitor-quality (nor should they be!), but they also don't sound like you're listening to some crap 48kbits/s KaZaA-era mp3 either...not that I know what that sounds like... aherm... The device is plenty loud for me, I can hear it clear across my place, I can hear it out on my balcony, down by the pool fountains, wherever.  The physical buttons feel like they will hold up well for several years to come, and the size and shape are comparable to those other poolside bluetooth speakers, without feeling like you're Dr. Mario wielding a giant medicine pill.  The form is straightforward and befits the function.    One word of caution for setups - if you have a dual-band wireless router, you MUST use the 2.4GHz band for authentication, but you can toggle the 5GHz band back on after the authentication.  After a lengthy discussion with the support techs and a lot of head-banging about an error that neither of us had on our radar (Error 7:3:4:0:1, for which Reddit AND the tech's own knowledge base failed us...who woulda known!), we finally got the problem solved.  The second-tier support tech was awesome, he was very friendly and helpful.  Making it through the first-rounders of the tech support bunch though....that was a doozy. There was a communication barrier and lots of repetitive troubleshooting steps, restarting everything under the sun, including the cellphone I was talking to her on.  This 2.5-hr (!!!) support call is the reason for the minus one star. ",

"Lon J. Seidman","March 4, 2017 ",4.0,"The Amazon Tap is a smaller, portable version of their popular Echo intelligent speaker.    It's funny, this may very well be the best bluetooth speaker out there. It sounds great but also has a lot of intelligence around it thanks to the free Alexa voice service.    What's nice about this one vs. the Amazon Echo is that the Tap is battery powered and portable. It's also not always listening and requires a tap of a button to activate its voice commands. Those looking to play with Alexa services can now do so without having a device always listening in the background. ",
"Kory Wood","July 7, 2016 ",4.0,"The Amazon Tap leaves much to be desired. The sound quality on the device is sub par, with almost no bass and distortion at 75% or higher volume. Yes, it is an amazing product, nice feel, nice design. There are clear missteps in Amazon's choices for the product. $129 is rather steep for a Bluetooth speaker these days. You can get one, on Amazon ironically, for $20. Additionally, the charging experience with the Tap Case is terrible. You have to take the case off to charge it or slip it to the side which looks terrible. Had they chosen a more technically relevant charging method, such as Qi charging, they could have avoided this. Also, when trying to pair your Tap with a hotspot, you will soon find out that the way they have implemented that setup process that it is impossible to use the phone to configure the Tap if it is also the hotspot. You will need another phone with the Alexa app installed and and activate the hotspot on your other phone. There is also little to no documentation from Amazon on this, and the hotspot capability is featured in the advertisement video, so you think they would have made it more clear. ",
Angela,"April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I like it for the most part. Got it for Christmas. I didn't use it all that often and then the update came and I could turn on the feature so I didn't have to press the button to talk to the device. It went downhill from there.

I've got it connected and it seems ok. But when I turned on the hand free mode the battery issue started again. Even though it's plugged in and charging it's losing battery life.

I'm using my Tap way more than I use my portable Bose.  I wish I could exchange our Dot for another Echo or another Tap, because we are very pleased with both.

kriley,"September 13, 2016 ",1.0,"Don't buy this unless you have a single band router!  Otherwise, you will have to reset the unit each time you &#34;Tap&#34; it on.  What a nuisance.  I have found that many IT &#34;professionals&#34; seem to think that the modern home has only one or two computers or peripherals.  How those IT &#34;professionals&#34; can be so short sighted is beyond me.  I can only ascribe it to either short sightedness or, which is more probable, an inability to develop software commensurate with today's modern environment.  In my opinion, Amazon needs to either terminate the programmers who failed to write code properly or reassign them to a task more fitting of their skills like lifting and carrying Amazon shipping boxes.

"Brian K Meagher","July 7, 2016 ",5.0,"Echo's little sister, Tap, also named Alexa (weird family naming conventions) is a little rock star in her own right! She is simply the best portable  bluetooth speaker I've used yet.    She's a little hefty for her small size, a little thick - but that explains the great sound she produces from such a small package.    She's loud and smart! And the Alexa voice is rich and soothing. And before this review gets creepier... :)    The bass response is remarkable, with a nice balance up thru the mid-range and highs.    Others' have written about how great this little speaker / internet appliance is, so I'll just post a few Pros and Cons in my opinion.    Pros:  - Sound. Superb for the size. Loud without distorting, great bass response.  - Simple controls for volume up / down and previous / next  - Pause / play button works in all my apps  - Podcasts sound great too - especially when professionally produced (hello TMOS fans)  - Love the quick Alarm settings - so easy to set when you're passing out, er... going to bed at night.  - Manufactured incredibly well - very solid materials - it's almost as if Apple made something cool again (don't hate... I love Apple products too)    Cons:  - She is very verbose - every time you want to power up the bluetooth she gives long-winded instructions. Ok, Alexa, I get it. I wish the App had settings to dial back the instruction set to just the minimum words. Like &#34;Connected&#34; instead of &#34;On your device, choose TAP N Dash 3 2 V&#34;  or whatever your Tap comes named as.  - She's LOUD! No matter what volume you have set for your music, her commands are LOUD!  - Wish you did NOT have to hold the command button in while speaking to her. Just a push to turn on listening would be better. For example, in the morning, when you are hung over... er, waking up and want to SNOOZE the alarm, you have to hold the button in while you say &#34;Snooze&#34;. Then she has to say &#34;Ok, snoozing&#34; really loud.  Alexa... just say &#34;ok&#34;. Jeeze, did my wife teach you to be so wordy?  - The bright power light stays lit all night while Tap is in the charging cradle. Really? Next to your bottle of water on the nightstand, you have a streetlight to deal with.  I end up taking the Tap off of the charging cradle just to turn off the power light.    Final thoughts:  Hopefully they will fine-tune the app, giving us more control over her volume, depth of verbose responses and dimming the power light - among other &#34;power user&#34; features that would make using Tap and Alexa a quieter experience. After all, I'm sure a lot of folks have her on their nightstands.    I've posted a pic of the big sister (Echo) alongside the little sister (Tap) for size comparison. (Echo is just as awesome if not more so).    Recommendation:  Get one of each! They are both great little appliances that each have their strengths and places in your home / life. You won't be sorry. Especially if you feel the need for both a fixed appliance the whole family can use (Echo) and a portable bluetooth speaker for just you to carry around. ",
BG,"February 6, 2017 ",1.0,"I've had my Tap for a few days now and have grown to really, really like it. I've found that it fits a very specific role in my house and it may not be for everyone but for what I want it to do it excels.  A few caveats: I was well aware of the shortcomings some reviewers have noted. I did my research before buying the Tap and knowing the issues some people had going in really helped me make my decision. The speaker is good, not great, and a tad underpowered, especially compared to it's big sister. That being said, they are VERY different devices that I use for very different things. The sound is good but you won't be turning to this device to be your primary source of music listening and if you are in the same room with your Echo you will almost always want to use that instead.  The point I really want to drive home is that if you are looking for get a smaller, portable Echo you may be very disappointed. It’s just different enough to let someone down if that’s the case. It is, however, a great portable speaker that I can use in the kitchen while also having access to everything my Echo does. I’ve used it on the patio with friends and it was perfect for providing background music over drinks. All my “smart devices” that were previously controlled through my Echo are still controllable through my Tap and having it at my bedside provides me with a LOT of extra convenience. Not being “always listening” is not a big inconvenience when you have an Echo in the room but having to hit a button before using voice commands may not be what some people want from an “Echo-like” device. It doesn’t bother me one bit but if you have an Echo and want a smaller “always-on” version for somewhere else in the house, you might want to compare the Tap to the Dot and see if the smaller, cheaper device is closer to what you might actually want.  Whether or not Amazon feels the same, this is an excellent COMPANION device to my Echo and by no means a perfect standalone device. If I did not have my Echo I think my enthusiasm for the Tap would be diminished to a great degree.  The goods outweigh the bad by a long shot but this device, more than you might originally imagine, can disappoint someone easily if they are not exactly aware of the device’s limitations. ",
"Amazon Customer","August 3, 2016 ",5.0,"I read a lot of the reviews primarily the negative ones about this device. A lot of the complaints were that you had to press the button to have it do anything and I can understand their logic. But this was designed to be a portable device and it works very well at that.    Now as to why I purchased the Tap. I had been purchasing items from Amazon for over 10 years and recently joined Amazon Prime. I had just purchased a new smart TV and figured the video streaming and free shipping made this a good deal. I started exploring what else came with my Prime membership and saw Prime Music. I really only listen to music while I am in my car and have never owned any portable digital music devices. The only exception being my iPhone which I used for phone, email and web browsing. When I discovered what I was able to access with my Prime membership I was hooked. I quickly put together a play list of some mellow music from the 60's and early 70's and thought this would be great to play for thanksgiving when I would have all of my family over. I knew that what ever I purchased would be moving between at least 2 rooms, so I needed something portable. It was 2 days till Thanksgiving and time was running out and I didn't have time to research hundreds of devices. I new that the Amazon Echo devices could connect to Amazon Prime Music so it was a matter  of choosing which one. It boiled down to the Echo or the Tap, I ended up choosing the Tap because it was less expensive and it was portable. I know I could have easily moved the Echo between rooms but I also knew there were going to be times when I would not be near power or want to run power outside. So the tap it was and I ordered it with next day delivery.    After working all day Wednesday then running around like a mad man getting the fresh bird, rolls, pies and the few things that I had forgotten. I finally arrive home and there is this small box from Amazon. I already knew from an email that Amazon sent me the day before what would be needed to setup the tap. I had downloaded the Alexa app to my  iPhone and had my wireless access code available. I plugged in the Tap's charger and set the tap in the charger. I then started the Alexa App on my phone and linked the Tap to my Amazon account. Then I pressed the Bluetooth button on the tap for about 5 seconds which started it's setup mode. Opened my phones wireless settings and connected to the Tap's wireless network. Then from the Alexa app I selected my wireless network and entered my wireless network access code. Setup complete in under 5 minutes. First command pressed the button and said &#34;Play Thanksgiving play list&#34; and the gods said let there be music.    Thanksgiving Day the Tap was a big hit with the family.  Most didn't even realize that the sound was coming from the Tap they kept looking around the room asking where the speaker was until I pointed my finger at the Tap. Everyone was amazed at the sound that came out of it. It is not a Bose audio system but the sound quality was more than good enough for my family and I.    Now a couple of warnings.    1) These devices are very addictive. Once you see what you can do with it you will be hooked. This technology is so cool and it is still in it's infancy.  2) Jeff Bezos is a genius. He created Amazon Prime so people would sign up for free shipping. Then provided Prime Music and Prime Video. Next came Alexa and the Echo's. He got me HOOK, LINE AND SINKER.    Now a couple of negative things.    1) At the beginning of this post I mentioned the negative comments about having to press the button to activate the Tap. There is a work around to this problem. The Echo Tap has an audio input and the Echo Dot has an audio output. You can plug the output from the Echo Dot into the Tap and output the Dot's audio to the Tap and you can now do this by using the name Alexa to wake the device. Yes you have just turned your Tap into just a speaker. But you can now use voice commands without pressing a button.    2) You are able to set timers and alarms. The issue that most people complain about is the same issue I have. You cannot set the alarm to wake you with music. Though there is a very outside the box work aroung. You can set an alarm on your smart phone using a custom file that say's Alexa play Beatles or whatever.    The Echo family of devices are an awesome product and I would recommend them to anyone looking to stream music or do Home Automation. The Jetson's are coming. ",
"Scott Stewart","August 21, 2016 ",5.0,"At first glance I was impressed with this speaker. The charging base was solid and heavy, and the speaker felt really good in my hand. After turning on the speaker I needed to pair it to my wifi which I wasn't able to do because I wasn't at my home, so I just connected it to my Bluetooth on my iPhone. Well, when I got home it was a pain in the neck to &#34;then&#34; connect it to my wifi. Once I got it connected to my wifi the app just simply restarted and then wanted me to go through the setup process again...well, I don't know what maze of buttons I need to press to &#34;restart&#34; the setup process. So the app that works with the speaker is also junk. I have been using the Bose Soundlink Mini II for as long as it's been out, and when you compare the two the Amazon Tap sounds like a little cheap toy compared to it. I knew that the Bose would be better but I didn't think it would absolutely crush the Tap. Also the Amazon Tap has very little bass, and once you turn up the volume the speaker automatically dims the bass. For a speaker that has this price tag and as heavy as it is, it shouldn't turn itself down when you start to get a little volume out of it. Sent it back the day I got it and if I need another speaker I will spend the extra chump change and get a much better Bose speaker. ",
3party,"December 7, 2016 ",4.0,"I use this as a speaker and neglect Alexa altogether because Siri gets very jealous.  As a speaker, this unit is phenomenal.  I have seriously up-market sound equipment, including a pair of KEF 7's, and am very fussy about sound.  This portable unit really is astonishing and sounds like a much larger speaker.  I believe the circuar shape helps with that.  Highly recommended. (Do not leave Siri and Alexa alone in the same room. They fight.) ",
Ocean,"June 30, 2016 ",1.0,"I'm pretty sure I got a lemon and will be returning.  I already have an Amazon Echo, and it works like a charm.  Never once lost connection to the network.  However, the tap is constantly losing wifi pairing... even though it may across the room from the dot.  In 3 weeks I've had this, I've had to repeat a lengthy setup process about 12 times in my house.  I've only setup Dot, one time in two months.    Update: Retuned Tap, received new one, same problem with dropping WiFi connect.  I googled the web and see that others are having the same issue.  I did all the normal things like checking router, rebooting, etc. but nothing helps.  My Dot still works like a champion and my tap keeps dropping WiFi at least once a day.  I guess I'll try returning again, Amazon support has nothing new to add except for swapping out. ",
"Michelle Touchstone","April 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I really loved the Tap when I got it, except that I could not do hands-free. Then in February Amazon announced that a free software update will allow this. So we waited on buying an Echo Dot. It is now April 14th and I have yet to have the software update occur. In mid-March after seeing most people had the update already I reached out to Customer Service, was told it must be defective, and a new device was sent to me. 3 weeks later from receiving the new one and guess what: no software update again either! Every time we try to follow up on a ticket created we're told to reset it. Do that and no update. It even says in 24 hours we will. Reset after 4 days again, no update. Then told it will take 24 to 48 hours to get results on our ticket. Here it is 2 weeks later and nothing new. Then they tried to tell me today it is an isolated incident and want to send me a new one yet again! Um, don't care to have to wait yet again. If you can't fix the issue and do a software update when a device is hooked to Wi-Fi all the time and it's Wi-Fi strong enough to update Fire Stick software all the time and stream with no issue, then why would I want a new one yet again? ",
"J. Bonanno","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"Had it for 24 hours and first impression is that it does everything pretty well, but nothing exceptionally well. The speaker quality is okay, but not amazing. And having to press a button for Alexa makes it less appealing.    However getting all these features in a slick package may be worth it for many people - me included.    Side note. What is going on with the usb outlet adapter. The thing is almost 2&#34; long. Designers at Apple lose their jobs for such sloppiness and those at Amazon lose limbs (or so I've heard). I assume this abomination will result many employees walking around the campus without various arms and legs and I can't say it's not been earned. Shame on them. ",
"Amazon Customer","August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"This is an excellent compromise device for many specific use cases.  I also own the Echo which I purchased almost a year ago, and enjoy a great deal.  The problem I had with the Echo was that it was stationary.  We live in an apartment and that is a problem.  The problem was if I wasn't in the room with the Echo and wanted to hear music free of irritating headphones, I would have to turn the Echo way up, which isn't really cool to do in apartment building.  The wonderful thing about the Tap is that it's a more personal / companion device.  I can use it in my home office, bedroom, balcony, etc.  It can be close to me so I don't have to disturb my wife in another room.  I have headphones for when I really want to blast the music.    I could have just purchased a Bluetooth portable speaker, but then I would have to mess with my phone for all the different music sources.  With the Tap I still have Alexa, Pandora, radio, Prime Music, My own collection, News brief, etc.  Although I do have to press a button to talk to the Tap, it's still better than messing with my phone.    I'm not getting rid of the Echo, but if you view the Tap as a Bluetooth speaker on steroids it's a great compliment to the Echo.  Don't look at as an Echo replacement but rather a more personal device, for around the house and beyond, for folks who don't like to wear headphones all the time, and see value in Amazon and Alexa as a complete audio hub.  One big advantage that Tap has over Echo is the Bluetooth pairing.  With the Tap I can also play that part of my music collection that isn't stored in the Amazon cloud.    The compromise part comes in at sound quality.  The sound quality from the Tap is good, but not as good as some other speakers or the Echo, but it is good.  You can't defy the laws of physics.  The smaller the speaker the less bass the speaker will be able to produce.  That being said I'm more than satisfied with the sound quality of the Tap considering the flexibility the form factor offers.  Excellent product! ",
rustlor,"August 11, 2016 ",4.0,"Update. Love and would buy 3 more if i could get them at a good price.  Ill keep watching. Not interested in the dot because of sound / functionality Ive read about.  Ive introduced this to many because i take everywhere.  Cant say enough about except the price is too high for gifts ive got 6 people i would like to give them to.  Setup easy, use easy. Sound good. Not as good as echo but worth the diference for mobility.  Got a case and cover that work well and will enjoy as more features come onboard.     Wasn't sure about this but love the echo and was interested in portability.  The sound isn't quite as good as echo.  However it is 1\2 the size.  I do wish they had included a cover since it is getting carried around and after the $$ I don't think another $20+ for a cover should be necessary.  Overall sound isn't bad. I mostly use it for audio books and questions. If its easy enough to use  I am  getting one for my Mom for her music.  Expensive but if you will use it its well worth it.  I've had the echo since the beginning and have watched its abilities expand. This little device is like that. If they keep going with its skills it'll be we'll worth the money.  Keep those skills coming. If your an Amazon hater just don't buy.  We know what amazon is. They can't trick you if you know going in.  There goal: sell. But, you gotta admit they've made some good products. I bought two competitors products before falling in love width the fire stick.  So, go in eyes open but the products are good quality.  I did not receive a discount for this review ",
"Amazon Customer","June 23, 2016 ",5.0,"I used the Echo before and that was really a game changer. The big difference of the Tap is that it's mic is not always on. You have to press a button before talking to it, even when it's connected to a power source. This basically takes away the most exciting feature of the Echo. If they would change that with a software update, the Tap would be truly amazing.  In that sense, the Tap is just another Siri or Google Now and the portability that you get isn't worth that much either because connecting it to a new wifi in not overly convenient. Using it in the shower or while cooking is out because you still have to press a button to do anything with it. The only use case I have for it right now is putting it on the patio.  It is still a nice product but the truly exciting one is the Echo; this is just a boom box with Siri. ",
Justin,"July 12, 2016 ",4.0,"Pros: Battery Life, Alexa, Line-In and Bluetooth connectivity.    Cons: Sound quality    I am going to start by saying that when compared to even the full echo quality is not as good. I have a few cheaper Bluetooth speaker only devices that also sound better. I think it is great for things like talk radio or comedy albums but it is lacking in range. Sound is a little washed out overall but for a portable speaker it is decent. If you compare it to other speakers in the same price range it is not on par but this isn't just a speaker. If you are looking for a great Bluetooth speaker in the same price range I would honestly look elsewhere but if you want Alexa and all of the voice integration that is where the Tap shines.    I take my Tap too and from work every day and usually on lunch I will listen to my flash briefing or a few comedy albums I have in my library. I also take my Tap all over my house and out into the garage, I enjoy being able to control my smart home devices from anywhere in WiFi range and since it has the same skills as a full size echo I don't miss anything that I am used to doing with my hard wired Echo and Dots.    One of my favorite uses though is when I am traveling or just on the go I use the tap as a speaker for my laptop. This allows me to stream movies with a little better sound than the built in speakers. In a world where everything is wireless it is nice to see that they left the audio jack on the device. I do wish that they would allow to choose if Alexa is disabled or not. When I have it plugged into my laptop it would be nice to listen to flash briefing without unplugging it first. Since I can stream the same library from Amazon and most other apps though this is by no means a deal breaker.    One other feature that would push this to a 5 star rating would be speaker phone support. If it would allow the Bluetooth connection to do more than just audio I could remove a device from my bag. Right now I still have to carry a small speaker that works well for phone calls and conferences and such. ",
mtt,"May 2, 2016 ",3.0,"I've only had the Tap for a few days so here are my first impressions:  - Set up was NOT easy. I tried on several 2.4 networks using the Alexa app on 3 different devices and the app crashed everytime during the setup. I used a laptop to finally get it set up. After that no problems.  -Sound quality is very good but not as good as the Echo but considering this is smaller as well as portable that is not a surprise. Music and audiobooks sound great. I have not tried any audiobooks via blutooth so I will not comment on any 'stutter'.  -Yes you have to tap the Tap to wake her up. I'm not sure why there are low rated reviews complaing about this since it's in the name of the product!  -Bluetooth seems to work well and easily connects with the mulitple devices I've tested.  -It does appear under the Alexa app so you can control it via the app as you would an Echo.  -I bought this on sale. I'm not sure if it's worth the full price at $130 but at under $90 it's a good portable 'smart' speaker.  -I like the charging station- very ergonomic and well thought out. No need to fumble with cables everytime you need to charge just place the Tap on the charger and wait for it go finish charging.  -The longest stretch I've used it is about 3 hours with zero battery issues.  -Overall I think it's a solid 4/5.    I'll try to update this after some more use.  Thanks! ",
"Travis C","December 6, 2016 ",4.0,"I purchased the tap plus an extra charging cradle.    The extra cradle will be used in my RV, while the main cradle will be set up as an anchor in my home.    Here are the best features, for me, of the Tap:    Sound quality is outstanding for such a small speaker.    Ease of setup with my iPad and iPhone.    The Alexa App is easy to get running so I could start playing around.    I love listening to my Audible books using Tap. Sound quality and volume are better than any of my other Bluetooth speakers.in fact, my wife and I used the Bluetooth connectivity while playing our Interactive Rosary app to pray the rosary tonight. Unlike all of the other Bluetooth speakers we've used, even the first words, &#34;I believe...&#34; are loud and clear using Tap.    Finally, the ability to listen to news headlines and radio is nearly as pleasurable and easy as is using iPad to prepare To Do lists and so forth.    Why do I Tate, &#34;Nearly...?&#34;    Because it is annoying to have to tap the microphone for each function or question I pose. I would strongly advise Amazon to re-engineer this to include a modified Echo-like always on feature. Say, an adjustable(?) duration of, say, five (or 10 or 20) minutes after the initial tap on.    About the ease of initial startup. This is a hybrid of intuitive and Microsoft Wizard application for setup. Still, although it is a little confusing to do, it is not difficult for most people. You hold the lower back button for five seconds, then go to iPad (or smartphone or tablet) settings to click on the Amazon Tap in wifi, then go to Alexa app to continue and enter the wifi password, etc. my point?    To many moving parts (figuratively speaking) that was confusing.    Mind you, I like Tap. It is a terrific device. My favorite function, though, is the ability to have Tap read aloud my Kindle books. The voice quality is very nearly as pleasurable as the professional narration performance of audio books. Say, oh, 75 percent. For some books, this is good enough to eliminate my desire to purchase the audible version. For others, no way.    So, in summary:    If always on connectivity or voice activation is important to you, buy the Echo. Otherwise, overall, I think Tap is the ideal.    Four stars out of five. ",
kriley,"July 14, 2016 ",4.0,"Don't buy this unless you have a single band router!  Otherwise, you will have to reset the unit each time you &#34;Tap&#34; it on.  What a nuisance.  I have found that many IT &#34;professionals&#34; seem to think that the modern home has only one or two computers or peripherals.  How those IT &#34;professionals&#34; can be so short sighted is beyond me.  I can only ascribe it to either short sightedness or, which is more probable, an inability to develop software commensurate with today's modern environment.  In my opinion, Amazon needs to either terminate the programmers who failed to write code properly or reassign them to a task more fitting of their skills like lifting and carrying Amazon shipping boxes. ",
"S. Medina","May 10, 2016 ",4.0,"I was completely surprised by how much I would wind up liking this device. I have an older car and I really don't listen to the radio all that much while in it. I tend to listen to an iPod more then anything and don't have a way to hook up an iPod in my car. So I picked this up thinking it would be a good option to listen to my iPod while on the road. Not only is the Tap excellent for that but its awesome for much much more. Turns out much of the music I listen to is available on Prime so I really don't have to bring the iPod with me much at all. I use the Tap to connect to my phone and listen that way while on the road. What an excellent idea!!    11/27/16 Update: I have been thrilled with my Tap up until this point. Now it plays music then stops, then it plays again and stops. I have even had it NOT play at all and it will tell me 15 to 20 minutes after that its &#34;having trouble...&#34; So now I have a Tap that works sometimes. I have emailed support and will call then when open. I tried to become a seller on Amazon and the help desk was not very helpful then. I wonder how helpful they will be now.    11/28/16 The Prime Music benefit works on and off. So it will play music then stop, then play then stop. It also seems like it has two separate volume controls. So when I say &#34;Volume two.&#34; that works for the music and voice response. But it doesn't control the alarm volume. So that I have to go into the Alexa app to adjust. Be sure to remember to do that  if you use this as an alarm clock because the default volume I think is a 7 or 8. So now that I am looking over my initial review I am no longer using this as an alarm clock or to listen to Prime Music. ",
"Kory Wood","February 6, 2017 ",1.0,"The Amazon Tap leaves much to be desired. The sound quality on the device is sub par, with almost no bass and distortion at 75% or higher volume. Yes, it is an amazing product, nice feel, nice design. There are clear missteps in Amazon's choices for the product. $129 is rather steep for a Bluetooth speaker these days. You can get one, on Amazon ironically, for $20. Additionally, the charging experience with the Tap Case is terrible. You have to take the case off to charge it or slip it to the side which looks terrible. Had they chosen a more technically relevant charging method, such as Qi charging, they could have avoided this. Also, when trying to pair your Tap with a hotspot, you will soon find out that the way they have implemented that setup process that it is impossible to use the phone to configure the Tap if it is also the hotspot. You will need another phone with the Alexa app installed and and activate the hotspot on your other phone. There is also little to no documentation from Amazon on this, and the hotspot capability is featured in the advertisement video, so you think they would have made it more clear. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"Hate to say that after two months my tap will no longer charge. I have tried hooking up to different micro USB cables and on the charging port and neither works. It really is a shame because I loved the convenience and sound quality of the Bluetooth speaker for the price. I doubt I'll be buying another Amazon device anytime soon despite how great they may seem at first ",
"Jorge Tovar","August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"The Amazon Tap is almost great. Overall, I loved the concept. A portable speaker with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combined with a voice assistant. It is almost the perfect companion. My goal was to have a speaker I could carry around the house and outside with me. I currently own two Sonos speakers but I cannot afford to have Sonos speakers set-up in every room. Here is where the Amazon Tap comes in.    I currently use the Amazon Tap as a fill-in device for the moments when I just need some music playing but do not care about having the ultimate in sound fidelity. Alexa joins me in the shower every morning and every Sunday when I am cooking. The Amazon Tap is perfect to bring outside when you are going to grill something up quickly. In terms of portability the Amazon Tap is a 10/10. The fact that you don't need to plug it in to charge is what really sets it apart.    Alexa is very good at processing my requests and find myself frequently surprised by how much ambiguity she can handle.    I love the Spotify integration! When I open up Spotify, I have the option to send music directly to the speaker from within the Spotify app. No clunky ugly interface to deal with like Sonos.    Sound quality is OK but not great. Amazon could really have done a better job here but it honestly is good enough for me.    Here is the most frustrating part about the Amazon Tap. The push to talk feature. I do not understand why the Tap cannot have active listening like the Echo. If it could actively listen to requests without the need to &#34;tap&#34; it, this device would have received 5 stars from me.    If you want a portable speaker to bring with you to the beach, in the shower, or around the house, the Amazon Tap will serve your needs very well. Alexa really sets it apart. It will not have the best sound quality but it is very good. I just wish Amazon could issue a software update so that I could ask Alexa for something without needing to tap it. ",
Angela,"February 3, 2017 ",1.0,"I like it for the most part. Got it for Christmas. I didn't use it all that often and then the update came and I could turn on the feature so I didn't have to press the button to talk to the device. It went downhill from there. Stopped fully charging and kept disconnecting from the internet. I could barely get through 2 songs and it would quit on me. Shut off and then on. Wouldn't charge. Amazon sent me another. I've got it connected and it seems ok. But when I turned on the hand free mode the battery issue started again. Even though it's plugged in and charging it's losing battery life. It's a really bummer. ",
"Darnell C","May 3, 2016 ",4.0,"The Alexa software works &#34;fine&#34; after you basically try 101 times with voice training setting(Amazon keeps on updating it so there are always adding something new), the music quality is good just that you will loose the bass after volume 7, I like the fact that you can hear your notifications on it(incoming text messages, voice calls, Skype calls etc) but once answered your wireless device the music will stop playing(unless you are using Skype on your computer in that case the music will keep on playing throug the speakers and the call will be handled trhoug the speakers of the computers). I give it one star because after 4 months of having my first one it started displaying that an aux cable(I have never used a aux cable with this before) is connected not allowing you to play music from the Alexa app and therefore forcing you to input the commands by using the tap button. I've contacted Amazon many times with the issue and the answer is always the same: re install the all in your phone, are you sure there is nothing connected? and try turning off and back on the speaker. If you are considering one of these Alexa enabled devices I would recommend spend the extra bucks and get the echo or just buy a different brand Bluetooth speaker.  PS: I have two of these devices and one of them was located at the top of my closet, that's why is a hassle having to climb up to tap when before I could just use the Alexa app to input commands. ",
Jonathan,"April 23, 2017 ",3.0,"This speaker is nice and has a good stand by battery. It works similar to the Echo unit that I have, but does not require the use of saying &#34;Alexa/Echo&#34;. Rather, you press the button on the front of the speaker and give the demands that way. The sound is nicely balanced, but does lack some of the bass that is present in speakers in this price range. I've also purchased the Fabriq speaker, which is $50, and that speaker is not as loud, but definitely contains a more bass heavy sound (along with LED lights on the bottom). I also have the protective cover that Amazon makes for this speaker and while it does provide an easy handle/hook and protection, the bottom of the cover does not allow for one to take advantage of the wireless charger this is provided with the unit. Rather, you will have to plug in the unit each time that charging is required. For music, movie watching and everyday use, this product is perfect, but it will not provided enough sound to fill a large room or party. For its size, it is a solid unit with lots of capabilities that are not found on the traditional Bluetooth speaker. ",
"G. Sargent","August 24, 2016 ",1.0,"This is a keeper! I take it to bed every night!    Bought the Tap to use at night time to listen to prime music or iHeart Radio stations. Was thinking of an 'Internet' radio, but decided to give the Tap a try. It has work very fine for me.  There is no need to elaborate much given all he reviews and answered questions here. A few comments:    Likes:  - Size & solid feeling  - Battery powered and charging stand.  - Simple to configure and, as expected, is very well integrated with the Amazon Prime world.  - Good sound for music .. more than meets my expectations for sound quality and level  - Alexa understands my voice at near 100% out of the box  - Alarm clock like functions  - Very simple to select Amazon Prime music or iHeart Radio stations. Very quick response. Just say what you want and it's there a second or two later. Example: push the button and say &#34;play WLW&#34; and in just a few seconds you are listening to radio station WLW.  Say &#34;play Adele&#34; and there she is!  - Alexa has a sexy voice    If I had my dreams for this:  - Actually just a bit too much bass for speech (I'm a hard of hearing with typical treble roll-off) .. wish there was a music & speech tone setting. Not a show stopper.  - A small LCD display could be used to good effect. Or even a tiny 2 by 2 or 3 by 3 inch display for Prime video!  - I could tell Alexa my problems and she would have all the answers for me.    Shhh .. I'm married .. don't tell her that I have a crush on Alexa!    Seriously, this a very fine product and, as an engineer, I really appreciated the design and manufacturing effort that resulted in the Tap. ",
B.,"January 12, 2017 ",4.0,"Love it!  We have the full-size Echo, the Echo Dot, and recently purchased this guy because we were getting frustrated with our Dot (doesn't listen very well, we regretted buying that one).  The Amazon Tap is great!  Listens well, it's portable, the battery lasts a good amount of time before needing to be recharged, and the sound is pretty good for such a small speaker!  I'm using my Tap way more than I use my portable Bose.  I wish I could exchange our Dot for another Echo or another Tap, because we are very pleased with both.  If you're a Prime member, Alexa is a must have and if you need something portable, this is it!! ",
"Joe P.","April 24, 2016 ",5.0,"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!!  LOL  So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT&#34;S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that  Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!! ",
"K. Harrison","December 3, 2016 ",5.0,"Now that the need to press (&#34;tap&#34;) a button in order to interact with the device has been eliminated,  this is almost the perfect little Echo.    It sounds great,  and love the fact that it's battery powered and very portable. It competes nicely against other portable bluetooth speakers,  but it has the added benefit of full Amazon Echo integration.    If the original,  full size Echo is a 10 in terms of sound quality,  I'd give te Tap about an 8.5.  For comparison purposes,  I'd rate the Echo Dot about a 2. I would never use it to play music unless it was connected to external speakers.    My one gripe is that I wish there was a way to turn off the confirmation chime that it makes when you say the wake word. I have that turned off on the Echo and Dot,  but haven't found a way to turn it off on the Tap. It annoys me.  When they do that, its perfect. ",

"Jack Merritt","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I ordered this product to be delivered to Staten Island around 11:30AM today and received it before 5:30 PM the same day, already synced to my account and 87% charged.  Amazon, how in the world are you going to top this?  I own 3 echoes, the difference between the Tap and Echo are that the Tap is portable with a rechargeable battery and it does not have a wake work you need to press a button. Setup is pretty simple, download the free Alexa app,  then press the sync button for five seconds, then go to the settings of your phone or tablet and change the WiFi to the Amazon one that pops up, Alexa tells you to go back to the Alexa app and complete the process which includes using your WiFi password so have it ready. Other than that they are about the same; to-do lists, shopping lists, news briefing, music, alarms and time are all available on Tap.  Here is one, you say &#34;Simon says&#34; and then whatever you want and Alexa will repeat whatever you say. The sound is deep and crisp.  Warning this is addicting, it will be hard to go back to pushing buttons.  You will use it for music and asking the time at first, then news and shopping lists, then to-do lists.  You will love saying &#34;who sings this?&#34; ",
"Sarasota Suncoast Reviewer","August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"I love my Echo - love love love it!  The Amazon Tap feels like the musical extension of the Echo.  While it isn't voice activated YET (I expect that sometime in the future this may be avaialbe) it is easy to use by &#34;tapping&#34; the mic button on the front of the device.    Great hi-fi sound for such a little device.  While I expected the unit to be about as big as an Echo it is not.  I compare the sizes this way:  the Echo is about the size of a can of tennis balls and the Tap is about the size of a can of racquetballs.  A mini version.    Directions were good and clear and setting up the Tap was easy peasy (especially if you are accustomed to the Echo).  I like the tray charger but when I bought a sling, it doesn't make using the tray charger possible without taking off the sling.  Since I am not going to dress and undress the Tap that often, I charge the unit by plugging the mini USB plug directly into the Tap.  The little tray charger is pretty cool though - sit it on there naked and it will charge without plugging anything into the Tap.    Am truly enjoying this little device with the big sound.  Quite happy, actually :) ",
"Steven C. Wolodkin","August 14, 2016 ",5.0,"I had initially been introduced to &#34;Alexa&#34; by my sister. After experiencing one evening of a wide range of music and amazing sound quality, I was committed to getting the Amazon Echo. Then I went to the Amazon site and discovered the Tap. It was to be released in just a few days on 3/31/16, and actually arrived on that day. The short wait was well worth it due to the following: freedom of use without AC power via a long-lasting rechargeable battery (portability), Bluetooth connectivity for when you're away from Wi-Fi (playing your personal library), more compact size with only a minimal reduction in sound quality (still amazing), and, last but not least, I prefer pushing a button over having to say &#34;Alexa, do or play this or that.&#34;  You just push the button and say &#34;news&#34; to hear your choice of news sources. Or push the button and say &#34;battery&#34; to hear what the current % is. Or push the button to ask what alarms I have set. And while I like the name Alexa, I never have to use that trigger prompt. I think my girlfriend would start to feel a little jealous if I was always using Alexa's name!  In summary, it's $50 cheaper than Echo and with it's portability, Bluetooth connection, and great sound, it's a smart choice and an amazing device. ",
jelz,"July 20, 2016 ",5.0,"The amazon TAP is my go-to device. For playing music for everything...I use it every night to fall asleep to my &quot;sleep sounds&quot; app. I connect with bluetooth  to my iPhone, then I use my sleep app that plays sleep sounds.  I also use it when we go to the pool for music...all you have to do is ask Alexa to play anything for example, &quot;play Top pop, country etc. on Prime music&quot; and she will play it. It has so many options. It's small compact, and easy to tote around. You can ask it to give you today's briefings...weather tell it to sing to you tell you a joke. (my kids love that option). We bring it to Football practice.  The battery charger dock is unique and useful, I prefer it over a plug in battery charger.  Great gift for someone too with the holidays around the corner! ",

Red,"October 24, 2016 ",5.0,"I think I have two core issues with this device which is why I can't give it five stars:    1) As a portable device it should support multiple wireless networks (like a tablet, laptop, or phone). I'd like to register it on my home network and on my hotspot - that way when I'm out and about it can still play Pandora without having to stream it from my phone over bluetooth. It would also let other people change what we're listening to just by asking instead of asking me to do it manually. This is what I expect from an Echo.    2) It needs a listen mode. The best would be a listen button in place of the don't listen button. That way it would default to not listening but you can turn it on (just like with the Dot and Echo where it will listen until you press the don't listen button. At this point a command would be better so they don't have to release a new device. Press - &#34;Turn on microphone&#34; or &#34;Start listening&#34;    Other reviewers have pointed out that it's not the best speaker in its class, and I agree, but when listening to music on medium levels it sounds great.    All in all I'm happy with the purchase. We use it in the RV and sometimes just when we're hanging out on our deck so we don't have to blast the stereo in the house. ",
"J. Stewart","February 7, 2017 ",2.0,"Fun little speaker with pretty good sound (not much bass but crystal clear vocals).  Easy to use: just press the button and there's Alexa to answer your questions, brief you on today's news and weather, tell you lame jokes and riddles, and play anything you'd like.  Tap keeps a consistent connection to play music all day long and the battery has been 8-9 hours strong.  I appreciate Tap's ability to be taken to any room in my home or outside, and she travels easily too.  And for the Black Friday $90 price, it's a great value. ",
"L. Ignelzi","April 29, 2016 ",4.0,"Just when you think Amazon can't get any better, they come out with the Tap. It is the perfect compliment to the Echo. Love the idea of listening to my music any where any time. Love that I can be in country home with very limited wi fi use (pretty much dial up) and listen to my downloaded music of which I purchased a cheap mp3 player with lots of memory and downloaded my entire 5000 amazon songs as much as I want. The portability is so fantastic and it has all the echo features that make it so amazing. As perfect as echo is for the home. The Tap covers everything else including travel. I was considering the bose bluetooth speaker but luckily held off. The Tap sound is every bit as good as the Bose at a lot better price and you have all your music prime music and full access to all the echo greatness. You will not be dissappointed with the Tap.. ",
Aschr,"November 27, 2016 ",5.0,"We have the original Echo, the Dot and now the Tap. We LOVE these. My kids use them for timers for their required reading every day. They use them during the school year when they need help spelling a word, getting a definition or help with a math problem. When I was a kid, I had to use the encyclopedia and a dictionary. This is that and then some! We use the Tap out by the pool to listen to Pandora or I heart radio. The kids love hearing jokes too! I always take tap into my kitchen before a shopping trip and add what is needed to my list, then pull up the list on my phone in the store. The timers are great for cooking too! I think these are a must have for every home!!!! ",
jwillin,"April 15, 2016 ",5.0,"I like the Tap although it is no Dot or Echo. I like the portability of the Tap.  The sound is good. I have it connected to other devices for the speaker. My only problem is having to touch the mic every time I needed to use it. That got old quick. I am now an owner of the Dot and Echo. They have been great. I have my Tap because if I leave the house, I can take it with me. That's a good thing. I am not disappointed with my purchase.    I would recommend the Tap if you are one that loves using a speaker for audiobooks and other audio files. Plus, of course you will still need an Internet connection if you want to use Alexa and the other apps that works with it based on a wireless connection. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"Hate to say that after two months my tap will no longer charge. I have tried hooking up to different micro USB cables and on the charging port and neither works. It really is a shame because I loved the convenience and sound quality of the Bluetooth speaker for the price. I doubt I'll be buying another Amazon device anytime soon despite how great they may seem at first ",
"Josh Mitchell","August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"Pretty good.  The sound is reasonable, the device is small and light (especially because I was expecting something more on the order of the Echo).    Now, here's why I don't love it: &#34;Tap&#34; is a little bit of a misnomer--from the name, I expected the buttons to be the kind of touch-sensitive button on a high-end gaming console.  Instead, the main button you interact with is--on my unit at least--a little mushy and hard to operate.  Similarly, the power and setup buttons on the back are sometimes unresponsive.  I've also had consistent problems with the device losing touch with servers when I try to start listening to an Audible book, which necessitates going through the annoying WiFi setup process each time.  As a result I've been using this primarily as a Bluetooth speaker, for which it's perfectly adequate.  But not being able to trust the additional Alexa functionality like reading an audiobook--which was the reason I bought the thing in the first place--has soured me on it somewhat. ",
Beck,"February 3, 2017 ",1.0,"As an Amazonian and owning the Amazon Echo and Dot I am extremely disappointed with my Tap. It continuously powers off and will not turn back on for minutes.

"Aki Jackson","July 29, 2016 ",3.0,"Great concept with poor execution.  #1 compliant - very poor sound quality.  Non-existent bass especially at higher volume.

"John Duarte","August 13, 2016 ",1.0,"When I first got the Tap I was a little  underwhelmed. Having too  push a button  too get do voice command I  felt  defeated the purpose of Alexi.  Other then that  it's  a  solid portable  Bluetooth speaker with  great sound, good  bass and good  Battery . I have seen more experience Bluetooth speaker with less quality then the tap. so if you asked me when I first got the Tap my opinion I would mildly recommend it as it's a decent Bluetooth speaker. But  since  the hands free always on update hit and now you could bypass the button altogether it's a game changer. Now it's like a  portable  mini  Echo it can hear me from across the room and it  pretty accurate too. So this is what it's like too live in the future . The only drawback back I find is sometimes the always  listening  timesout and stops working but a quick  reset fixes that problem. I'm  sure that it's something that  Amazon could fix in a future update. I say if your looking for a  portable version of the  Echo I can not recommend the tap  enough!! &#34; Alexa stop review. &#34; ",
"Amazon Customer","April 13, 2016 ",2.0,"I am extremely happy with this device. I had wanted an echo or dot for some time but the price was over what my budget would allow. I found a Tap that had been returned to a local store and was being sold at a reduced price. I took the plunge, and am so happy I did. The portability is a major pro for me over the other devices and the fact I can use it as a Bluetooth speaker is also a bonus (to be fair, I'm not sure if echo or dot have that function). With the hands free update I don't feel as though I'm missing any functionality. The only con I have come across is one of preference, I do turn it off or put it in sleep mode when I am gone to preserve the battery life so when I get home I do have to physically wake it up again. This is such a minor issue it barely a con, but it would be nice to be able to tell it to go to sleep vs. pressing the button manually. 1st world problem though :) ",
David,"February 17, 2017 ",5.0,"Not sure what the hype is about.  Not sure the battery lasts as long as stated.  Average device at best.  I would wait for next version.  I would give 1/2 star if that rating available. ",
ashleysmith,"March 27, 2017 ",4.0,"If you set this up and never moved it, it might be fine, but I waste a lot of time having to configure the device and re-connect it to wi-fi or fix the bluetooth setting.  I want to play music during my morning shower, for example, and for some reason or another I will have to spend three groggy minutes with the water already running trying to get the thing to work.  The sound quality is also poor compared to the cheaper bluetooth speakers my neighbors have.  Alexa and I do not get along! ",
charles,"October 30, 2016 ",1.0,"Really cool, much more than a blue tooth speaker. the Alexa streaming features make it easy to stream stations as a stand alone unit. I also like the news. Sound is good and loud enough, not much base though. Seems there could be a stack-able woofer. Battery lasts a good while. Looks nice but the cloth exterior picks up dirt and is starting to show some wear from moving is constantly.    Some things don't work as well as I wish. Like the alarm didn't go off that i had set. Also I'd like it if i could activate Alexa from the app on my phone instead of having to get up and go to the Tap every time. It now has an hands free mode which works perfectly but drains the battery. I wish you could set it up to use hands free while charging and for it to go into a power savings mode while off the dock.

"Retired Tech","June 22, 2016 ",1.0,"Feb 26 2017 update:  A real shame because I really LIKE these, but I had to downgrade from 5 stars to 3 because of wildly misleading claims of the Tap having &#34;stereo&#34; speakers.  These devices are omnidirectional mono, they are NOT stereo.  Two speakers within the same housing for separately reproducing high and low frequencies is generally known as a crossover (simplified version), a crossover does not in ANY way equate to being stereo  The makers know this, it's basic audio 101 stuff.  Please see the comments section for additional details.    Now read my original review below to learn how much I genuinely like these, the above is because I can't in good conscience excuse the scummy marketing tactics.  I'll delete the above and add the stars back only when this shameful deception ends.    Voice activation was just added (Feb 2017)  YAY!!!  Without voice activation it was already a VERY solid 4 stars.  I am EXTRA happy that they pushed the update to existing devices rather than only offering this feature with a new device... Bravo Amazon!    Now it's a solid 4 1/2 stars, the only things missing is the ability to use two together as a stereo pair, or more important to most users, to have the ability for several Echo's, Taps and Dot's to sync together and play the same thing all around my property.  Perhaps like the voice activation those abilities will later be pushed to existing devices???  &#34;Please sir, may I have more&#34;    Audio quality for the Tap is very good and it will play fairly loud,  I used it outdoors last summer while working up on ladders with hammers and drills and still did not need to turn it all the way up.  Battery life is very good, yet to have it run out on me.  Claimed to be 9 hours, or 8 hours if the new voice mode is switched on (voice mode is easily toggled on and off).  Keep in mind that higher volume levels draw more power, I imagine it isn't close to 9 hours at the highest volume setting.  Just physics, same would be true for any brand device.    Amazon's rubbery case for the Tap is just plain stupid, the case has to be removed to charge it... needless hassle and overpriced, the case is a big fail in my opinion.  Other than the black one all the colors are gaudy & kinda' childish looking... pssst, Amazon, how about some understated elegance instead of only the &#34;look at me, look at me&#34; choices.  Same applies to their overpriced tablet covers for Fire's and Kindle's.    The full size Echo with it's larger speakers does indeed sound a bit better, but not by a lot and it isn't portable.  The much smaller Dot lags well behind in sound quality and also has to be plugged in all the time.  Dot's are better suited (as intended) for info and alarms than for playing music, I have several placed in bedrooms, office, workshop etc and find them really, really handy for various home automation tasks, timers, calendar, weather reports...

cyber,"April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I just received mine yesterday. I have an Echo and love it.  This Tap is an excellent addition to the Alexia Amazon system.  Setup was easy, the sound is excellent from a small unit.  Very portable. Can easily move room to room.  Pressing the tap button becomes routine to control it.  So I say buy it if you like your Echo and want to carry it room to room.  I will also be using this unit on the road when RVing. It perfect for the traveler too.  I must also add the quality of the product is excellent as in every Amazon product. ",
"Guillermo Betancourt","August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"Update 7APR17 - About a review - Amazon Tab  Amazon Tab is the best portable Bluetooth speaker ever made. I just have to say that the sound quality is Excellent!! Works flawless with Spotify. Everything else that this device can do you can consider it as a free feature from Amazon considering the price tag of JUST $129.99 compared to $199 from other makers and you just get that, a speaker.    Read the features, is worth every penny. If is too much $ for you then wait for Amazon sales, I got one for just $69 during Prime Day.  Best Bluetooth speaker EVER -    I have no idea why engadget.com gave this product a bad review.  I think they were expecting a 1000 watts speaker on such tiny case. They also complaint about the not always on Alexa.  First of all, the speakers are just fine, they are really good. Second, how can you have an always on Alexa when the Tap is made to take it anywhere you want using its internal battery which by the way it last for a really long time. At least for me is working out really good and I take it almost every time I go out. ",
Middlebunny,"November 29, 2016 ",5.0,"I've been an avid Amazon customer since they started.  I have 2 kindles and was relatively satisfied.  I read all the rave reviews for the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.  They seemed legitimate; however, I guess those reviewers either had low expectations or were incentivized to express those favorable opinions.  After going on an Echo Dot, Tap and Echo purchasing frenzy, I now have a total of 3 Dots,1 Tap and 1 Echo and am suffering buyers remorse.    If you need or want to know the local weather or get  flash news updates on command, the Echo or Echo Dot are your devices.  I, on the other hand, use them for music streaming.  I find that the &#34;sleep function&#34; has flaws, voice recognition/comprehension needs great improvement and everyone should know that it is really unnecessary to buy more of these devices unless you have multiple amazon music accounts such that you can stream on those separate accounts from different locations/rooms.  Otherwise, users should know that the devices cannot be linked together for simultaneous streaming.  They also cannot be used by different parties to stream different music from each different device.  Apparently, Amazon Prime Music only allows streaming to one device at a time.    The Tap cannot be used for streaming unless a wireless connection is available.  I wouldn't recommend connecting via an unsecured connection so unless you have a secure, mobile wireless connection, the Echo Tap is nothing more than an expensive, portable bluetooth speaker which you can purchase for much less than the cost of an Echo Tap.    One might notice that the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap are often paired with supplemental bluetooth speakers with 2-3 item purchase combination discounts.  This is a very misleading promotion as it leads one to believe they can be used for simultaneous streaming.  That is not the case at all.  Unfortunately, the E-Dot only has a one-way BT connection.  Either you play music from the E-Dot or the BT speaker; but, you cannot play music from both.    There are a lot of Applications for Alexa, the voice operated system used to operate the E-Dot and Echo.  Unfortunately, a lot of them have complicated wake phrases/statements.  If you don't phrase the statement exactly right, the app won't work and Alexa will not understand the command.  You can honestly spend more time trying to phrase things correctly to trigger Alexa then it might have taken for you to manually execute what you wanted to do like creating a shopping list, or recording water consumption.    Another shortcoming with Alexa is the slow re-fresh rate of the application.  Sometimes, you have to completely exit out of it, stop it from running in the background on your phone and then reload it in order to get it to reflect your most recent commands or current &#34;now playing&#34;.  In addition, there are other limitations specific to music streaming.  Let's say you want to stream a specific artist all day long to soothe a pet with separation anxiety.  If 1) you set the sleep timer for longer than you'll be away (ex. for 12 hours) and 2) Alexa confirms she will stop playing in 12 hours, that isn't exactly true.  Alexa will actually stop playing when she reaches the end of the artist's play queue which may only be 4 hours of music.  Theoretically, you can manually or verbally set Alexa to repeat the queue; however, I haven't tested this successfully yet.  It may only repeat the queue once rather than indefinitely until stopped by the sleep timer.    My final Alexa app gripe relates to the repeat function.  Unlike the iTunes or Amazon Music apps, Alexa cannot repeat one song in a queue.  You'd think that toggling the repeat button 2 times would trigger this function; however, all it seems to do is toggle the repeat option to the &#34;off&#34; position.    All in all, individually each product has its benefits so my rating is a low 3.  There is just no reason, other than needing a device in a location outside of the primary product's voice range, to purchase more than one device.  My thought is that the Echo-Dot is the most versatile of all 3 products; however, the Echo has better sound quality.  I have noticed the improved sound quality on the Echo; but, the improvement really doesn't make up for the price difference.  If I could do it all again, I'd invest in the Echo Dot for home and an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker for work that I can connect to the iTunes or Pandora applications on my phone.  That way, I will still be able to stream Amazon Prime music through the Dot at home for the stressed pet while playing comforting music in my office. ",

"The Lawn Ranger","December 22, 2016 ",3.0,"It has connection issues, where it will cut out for 3-30 seconds at a time and then (usually) re-connect - even when it's literally just a few unobstructed feet from my router.  This, when my other wireless devices - laptops, tablets, iPads etc. have no connection problems at all, at the same time the Tap has problems.    Other than that it's pretty good, I am happy with the sound quality and the concept, it is a useful and entertaining device. ",
R,"March 24, 2017 ",5.0,"This device is wonderful. It works for me as a never-set talking alarm clock. I can set alarms and the alarm won't shut up until you ask it to. This is good, because I am a deep sleeper. I also use it as a portable stereo with my Amazon Music collection. I can have it play some ethereal music before bed, and listen to my music through the day. The sound is very good. Some have said the bass is weak? I don't listen to music that is bass heavy, so I don't really care about that. For those who feel there is no remote control of the device while listening to music? This is not true. If you go to the Alexa app, and go to &#34;Now Playing&#34; you can control volume, play/pause, and backwards/forwards track skipping. You can also gain access to your listening history, and control your listening without your voice, by tapping on an item in History under Now Playing. You can also control the device volume from the Alexa app. I also use this as a news aggregator for sources like CNN and NPR and WSJ. The add-on skills are very nice. I use the Focus Word add-on to help me throughout the day. This can also track my orders, which is pretty neat. Alexa is the one to thank all of this. She is one heck of a woman, and with so many things being taught to her, I suspect she will only get better. Another thing that I use this for is a talking book player. I can ask Alexa to read a kindle book, tell her the title, and she starts reading. Getting the weather and using Wikipedia are equally as easy. Last but not least, I use it as a Bluetooth speaker with my smart phone. One final note: some have complained about the requirement of tapping the microphone button to get to Alexa. I consider this a plus, as I am fully aware of when the device is, and is not listening. I feel that is better than having to worry about the Echo thinking you said Alexa, when you didn't. I highly highly recommend this to anyone looking for a portable powerhouse. Alexa? Keep up the good work and keep learning. You are doing awesome. :) ",
"Fredda Weinberg","December 12, 2016 ",3.0,"My Amazon boom box, it fills the room with audible quality.  I don't yet understand how the charger could be useful, but there it is.  A tablet is always closer than the button and does little but add another light.    When I wanted to hear my tracks through the room, I pair with this device.  Nightime it's the Dot.    Update: still earns four stars with an observation: Video overwhelmed the Bluetooth connection but audio is excellent a short distance away, enough for a workout.  I turn off the devices not necessary, to leave the EM environment less noisy. ",
ima_kev,"September 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I absolutely love my amazon echo, but dreaded moving it around when we had some gatherings (use it for music) so I felt the tap would be a great idea. I really like the compact size and the charging base is an amazing plus, but I just can't get over how disappointed I am about the sound quality. When compared to the Amazon echo, it has almost no bass and for something advertised as a portable speaker in my opinion it lacks sufficient volume necessary to get over some of the casual noises that transpire in the city.

Cons:  In order to load up a bunch of songs, I must pay a yearly fee.    The shuffle doesn't work very well.  I have 10,000 songs to work with, but it seems to play the same ones a lot.

GuruReview,"August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"Perfectly portable.  I was not sure how this product would compare to a similar Sony product that I have used in the past but I must say I am pleasantly impressed.    Size: The Tap is small enough to hold in your hand and move from place to place. It is not large or bulky which makes it perfect for easy portability and storage.    Sound: The sound quality is good as long as you don't turn it up to full sound because it does get slightly distorted.  I wouldn't use this for the sound for a big party but for personal use in the same room or an adjacent room the sound quality is sufficient.    Price: I purchased the unit on an Amazon deal day but after using it I still would have been ok with paying the regular price.    Features:  No, this unit does not have the Alexa touchless voice control like the Amazon Echo but I have a friend who has the Echo and never uses the Alexa touchless feature.  I don't even use the push button feature on the Echo so that particular feature was not of huge consequence to me.  It is available to tap the button on the front if you would like to get news, weather or other helpful information.    Quality: The Tap is well-made and durable.  I accidentally dropped it on my wood floor and it kept right on going as if nothing happened and no damage.  The buttons area easy to push and it works well with my Iphone pairing.  The charging base is small so it does not take up a lot of space and the charge lasts for several hours off the base or you can keep it on the base.  The base connects the USB to the wall charger rather than the unit so you only have to set the Tap down onto the plugged in base for it to charge.    Setup: It did take a bit for me to figure out how to pair it.  If you download the Alexa app on your smartphone it walks you through the process.  Once it is connected the first time it's easy to continue set up and use through bluetooth pairing and the sound controls on your phone can control the sound and playback functions on the Tap.    Overall: I give this product 5 stars because it is exactly what I was looking for as a portable, quality sound, personal use product. ",
"D. Langevin","January 6, 2017 ",1.0,"I bought my Tap at Best Buy about 2 months ago.  The sound quality is good and I am finding uses other than playing music.  However (and this is a pretty big &#34;however&#34;), my Tap has recently had problems communicating.  Seems to be an almost daily occurrence that I get the &#34;I am having problems understanding&#34;.  Please try again later.  I don't think it's my network because I am not having connection problems with other devices.  Because of this specific issue, I find it difficult to give this product anything better than 3 stars.    Amazon music app tends to disconnect frequently also.  I think the issue is on their end - not mine. ",
"Mary Inc","August 31, 2016 ",5.0,"My husband was away and gifted it to me as an Anniversary present since he won it at work. He was leaving on a deployment for a few weeks so figured I could use it and figure it out while he was gone. I ended up using it more than I use the TV lately. I always thought my in laws Echo was kind of silly to spend that kind of money on something like this. I was wrong we have used it a lot. I also now have some Dots. I had 3, but I am gifting two for Christmas to family. One Echo Dot I just gave to my parents. They seemed to like it and hoping it will help my father who is dying from stage 4 cancer. He's always asking for the weather etc so figured this was easier than him looking up. After owning the Tap first I do like the voice feature that is always listening on the others. I have a feeling we might buy more dots or get the Echo soon. I ended up using this lately for a Doberman I have bee fostering with the rescue. My two Dobermans are fine at home, but I could turn this on and tell it to play my calming playlist and put it on loop mode before leaving the house. I really think it helped her since she had a bit of anxiety while in the crate.    The one thing I wish if it could use my google play. I know that will never happen since they compete, but would be nice since I pay for google play music. We have left Pandora after quite a number of years, Spotify after never working right for my husband, and i heart as well. I know Google came out with something similar to this which I'm debating. I do everything on Amazon as well so not sure if I will or not. Google could let my husband down on the music stuff and we might migrate to something else so. We could migrate to the unlimited plan, but my husband can't use his own playlists on Amazon through my account since we don't share passwords. ",
bhod99,"January 23, 2017 ",3.0,"I have an Echo and have loved it since day 1. With the Amazon Tap, I just could not get useful results. Although anything I requested would show up in my Alexa app history, the Tap would only occasionally play something. Often it just went silent with no music, radio, podcast or whatever. Also when I set an alarm for 5:00 AM it would go off at 4:43, even though when asked the Tap had the correct time.  Sounds terrific, but something just not working like the Echo for retrieving and playing. Had to return it to Amazon, sadly. ",
David,"November 1, 2016 ",5.0,"Its fairly an amazing device. Volume is amazing for it. If you put it near a wall or something where noise bounces off from it amplifies it even more. I dislike that it doesnt come with a remote and you need to run and push it everytime to get it to do something. Definetly wish the remote was included instead of buying it seperate. I love that it has an app to help configure it and it asks for feedback if Alexa did what you asked of it or not. However, I would add a few commands to it to make it easier to use. I wish there was a way to manually add phrases or commands and integrate it to ourselves personally.    Few issues ive noticed are it was playing pandora and spotify at same time which may be a defect with the product itself. You cannot turn off all alarms at once you need to individually request for them to be disarmed which seems to be a programming issue that no one has found a need to fix.    I absolutely love the payment option however. Paying over five months is amazing. Doesnt hurt the wallet nor make someone feel like they have to be eating instant noodles for a week or two to make the difference of buying a speaker.    They need to work on the skills i feel. The one skill im using doesnt work very well and the others seem pretty lame.    Thank you for making this amazing product. I know it will only get better with time and through constant feedback which is why i gave my review on it. ",
"Frank B.","April 19, 2016 ",2.0,"I got my Tap for Christmas, and have enjoyed it very much so far. The sound is great! Sounds better than any other wireless speaker I've had. I also love the portability. I can take this thing anywhere unlike Tap's bigger brother, Echo. I had convinced myself that as soon as Amazon comes out with a hands-free version that I would be the first in line to buy one, but thanks to the awesomeness of Amazon I don't have to wait. They just came out with an update with hands-free!!! Works just like the echo, but I can take it off the charging cradle and take it with me wherever I go. If you have an Echo or dot, you should also go with the Tap. You will love it! ",
sailfishgolfer,"October 6, 2016 ",4.0,"Amazon Tap arrives and within 30 minutes I have it connected to wifi and playing music from my phone and Ipad!  Awesome right?  Wrong - unable to play any music from Prime.  Get on the phone to Amazon help, connected to call center in the Philipines.  Reset Tap twice....still no music from Prime!  How much does that service cost? Lol - So here's the solution: wait two days and we will call you back!  Really? I'm serious - this is all I'm told!    Next Day:  my ISP is Comcast, so I thought I'd call them for suggestions.  I used a chat window and the Comcast tech was great (yes even I was surprised).  Intinal set up of the Tap failed to install certain Internet protocols - (iVp6 specifically).  By doing a hard reboot of router, the device was then recognized correctly and Prime music works fine.  Total time to identify this issue and a solution was less 30 min.  One side issue is that if you look at your router for connected devices the Tap will show as an &#34;Android&#34; device - nothing associates with Amazon.  Amazon needs to change thisI  Changing the description in the app DOES NOT rename the device for identification.    As a result I am changing my rating from a 1 to a 4 stars.  Unable to give a 5 do to poor tech service ",
"J. Duesterhoeft","February 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I'm not sure how this ever made it to the market. I had purchased an Echo and instantly fell in love with Alexa. I ordered this without reading reviews thinking this would be similar, only portable, with perhaps a bit less sound quality.    I had hoped to be use it as a mobile home automation control unit. Without the always on voice control, it is simply not useful in that department. The Tap desperately needs the always listen feature, at least when on the charger base. Adding that would bump my score to 4.    Sound quality is pretty good in the low to mid volumes... turn it up to anything over 50% and you will instantly wonder if is broken. High frequencies get louder but not the low frequencies. At 70% you can barely hear any bass at all.    As for mobile... using Alexa requires a phone in hotspot mode. Why would anyone do that and not simply use Amazon Music/OK Google? You can get a cheaper bluetooth speaker which sounds a LOT better (such as the UE Boom)?    [update] Always on voice control has been added.... but, given the low sound quality, I would still choose to use the Echo with a battery boot (despite the total cost of that solution being ~double the cost of the Tap).

"THOMAS F GAUTHIER","November 30, 2016 ",4.0,"Ordered on Aug 15, but Nov 20...the battery lasts barely an hour. I doubled checked the original charger, seems fine.

"James E. Carroll","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"This unit works adequately as a Bluetooth wireless speaker, but there are cheaper ones that will do the same job just as well.  It is sold as part of a system including the Amazon Echo.  I bought one of those some time ago and it has worked well with only a few glitches I could work through by myself.  It took several tries to get it to talk to a new (eero) network with the same name as its predecessor, but I also found that was a problem reconnecting several other network components, so that isn't a unique problem to Amazon.    This Tap, however, is something else.  When I first got it, I charged it up and connected it as a Bluetooth speaker and found it to work OK.  However, I thought there might be some advantage to connecting it to WiFi.  That's where the trouble began.    The thing is supposed to work with the Alexa app to prompt you to go through steps required to connect to wireless.  At varying steps along the way, the process will stop with a hung page on the iPhone used to set it up.  I have been through the algorithm at least a dozen times, each time quitting the process in frustration.  The furthest I've gotten is where the thing scans for a wireless connection.  Well, the eero puts out a hell of a signal, and it runs at 60 down and 10 up, so there's no doubt that a wireless signal is available.    I tried to use the help files online, and didn't find anything particularly useful, so I used the &#34;contact us&#34; link.  They want to talk on the phone.  I don't.  A help file should be just that.    So I have a really nice Bluetooth speaker that will not do everything it is advertised to do. ",
"Malinda O&#039;Brien","August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"Okay. I have spent the last few days on an &quot;Alexa Induced&quot; whirlwind after starting with the Dot (returning it), upgraded to the Echo (I am going to return it tomorrow) and finally the Tap which is hear to stay and here is why....    My thought process...    Dot  Pros: inexpensive ($50), connects to other bluetooth speakers and controls smarthome  Cons: My wife and I had issues with bluetooth speaker (Bose Soundlink mini II) connectivity unless it was 3-4 feet away) and if the bluetooth speaker or stereo system goes to sleep than 1) you can't hear alexa at all requiring you to either keep it on all the time or 2) getting up and turning your second speaker (or stereo) on or off which take away from the experience for me.    Echo  Pros: sound quality and multi directional speakers which is pretty cool.  Con: Size (which can block your TV), cost ($179) and portability (again... see size).    I really liked Echo, but having to yell to it from my bedroom pretty loudly for it to hear me (which was going to get old fast), but the sound coming from it from across the house was great.    Tap  Pros: is median price ($129), really good sound quality (but not great), portability with good battery life and finally... Alexa can hear you without using the button!!  Cons: Not great sound quality but good (sound is richer with Echo so if you don't have a sound system for your home go with Echo) and not being able to connect to other bluetooth speakers.    Winner: Tap!  Portability was the game changer for me. My house is small-ish (1,650 sq ft) and Tap can hear me throughout most of the house, but in the few spots it can't  and due to the size I can't take Echo with me easily and the dot is great, but if the secondary speaker goes to sleep you can't hear the responses.    If my home was two story than I would probably say go with 2 Dots or a Dot and a Tap. For me being able to take the Tap with me and not having to yell across the house and hope Alexa hears me, being able to take Tap with me out on the deck and still automate my home is awesome and if I wanted to add another Dot than both the Dot and Tap would cost the same as the Echo so there you go.    PS - Amazon is pushing out the Tap update that allows you to voice activate Alexa, but there is no where to update the Tap through the Alexa app. After doing some research I found out that you have to push the power button on the Tap, completely power it down and power it back on again and it will update. Cheers! ",
"Paul C. Primrose","November 24, 2016 ",2.0,"Edit 1.21.2017 - From 3 to 4 stars.    A few weeks after my review below posted, the software issue magically cleared up. I'm unwilling to give it 5 stars due to that initial experience, but here are some pros / cons now that it works.    Cons: Not voice activated. I'm used to just telling Alexa to do stuff, so when I'm using Tap in the kitchen, I have to dry my hands or stop what I'm doing to go, well, tap it. Not a huge deal, but it's enough to make me write about it here.    Pros: Portability. If I have a home improvement project somewhere other than the kitchen or away from the other Echo, I just unplug Tap and take it with me. Super handy in that respect.    Takeaway: Probably worth it. Am now considering a Dot for the bedroom because I'm still an Amazon fanboy.    ----------------  There's something about the Tap's software that makes it a piece of crap. I bought the Tap for our kitchen counter, and it sits literally 10 feet away and around the corner from our Echo in the living room. We've had nothing but connectivity problems with the Tap since Day 1. I went online and found *some* helpful information; restarting the Tap seems to alleviate the problems *some* of the time. But having to restart or otherwise deal with semi-functional technology is way, way below my expectations, especially for Amazon.    This issue got better for a while, but as of this morning it's happening again. It won't play my beloved Wyoming Public Radio for more than a few seconds before cutting out again. Frankly, I don't care if this is a problem with Pandora, ISP, or some other random agent in the chain between the radio and Tap (and besides, I write this with Echo playing in the background like a champ -- no connectivity issue there!).    The Tap could be cool. I had high hopes for it. But my trusty ol' transistor radio just earned its varsity spot back and Tap is benched. ",

Homer,"October 19, 2016 ",4.0,"This is a simple and great addition for anyone who currently uses the Echo. Out of the box, the setup is a snap. It came almost fully charged. Plug in the base to the USB charger that comes with it, and the TAP speaker fits snuggly in the base.    Setup requires the Alexa app. Open it, go to setting, add a new device. Five minutes later you are up an running.  All of your music, Amazon prime, and just about everything that Echo does, the TAP does.  The sound is not as deep for music. It does have almost 360-degree circumferential sound, but there is no bass or treble adjustment. The voice is the standard Alexa voice, and the answers and responses mirror the Alexa system.  The speaker can run off your WIFI, or mirror you cell phone with a blue tooth connection. Very simple to set up. Blue tooth range appears to be over 30 feet.  It is small, lightweight, and adds the fun of being able to speak and get the music you want. I work in an environment where everyone likes to pick the music. Nothing is nicer than when you can simply hit the button and say, “play one hit wonders 80’s” or “play classic rock”.  For its size and weight, it packs good music and all the information that the Echo gives from the internet. It’s nice to be able to get weather and news updates with a simple push of the button.  I give it five stars. This is reasonable sounding, small, portable, easy to charge, and has the evolving Echo system that seems to keep getting better and better.  All of Amazon and the ongoing collection of music, news, Wikipedia, NPR, pod casts… all at your disposal.  So, if you like the Echo, or are just in the mood for a simple to use and lightweight and reasonable sound speaker, this one is great. Plus, it talks and has a relative sense of humor. ",

"Amazon Customer","September 19, 2016 ",3.0,"I bought the Tap when I was looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker to replace myJawbone Jambox. I like that the Tap is both a portable Bluetooth speaker and is part of the Alexa family.    We have an Echo is the kitchen/breakfast nook and recently bought a Dot we have been using in the master bath. The Tap is on the nightstand. We use it as a backup alarm, to listen to audiobooks, music, the news flash and podcasts when moving from room to room like when cleaning or when working in a room that doesn't have the Echo or Dot. It also has gone on some day trips including on the water (it can take some splashes but is not waterproof).    Yes, you have to &#34;tap&#34; to activate but the portability and length of battery life (@9 hours) makes up for that.    As for general complaints about what the Alexas can and cannot play music-wise I think this comes from not exploring all that is available.  Via Bluetooth they play music from your phone.  When connected to wi-fi they play iHeart radio, Spotify and Pandora. There is a lot of free music from Amazon Prime.  I chose to subscribe to the $7.99 Amazon Prime music for all devices but you wouldn't have to.    I like that the Tap, Echo and Dot are separate from each other. It means that we can listen to different music or be using them for different reasons at the same time.  If i am the only one home and am listening to an audio book each device can pick up from the same spot. Of course, the same is true if I am streaming from my phone.    It would be great to have an on-off button to turn the Tap into a device with a wake word and phone answering capability like my old Jawbone Jambox. Maybe both will appear in a future iteration. ",

I could not tolerate that any longer and bought her the Amazon Tap, so she has a decent speaker for her apartment... and returned it after one day.    I did not test-listen it, since I thought that spending &#62;100$ should provide me with a decent speaker. Amazon Tap proved me wrong. Even though the look and feel of it seems to be appropriate, the sound of it disappointed me. Since I am not a sound analyst or did any objective measurements, I will not use fancy words to describe the sound. It just sounds really thin and weak.    I do not recommend to buy the Amazon Tap (to only listen to music)!    I ended up buying the &#34;Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker&#34;. It costs $ 15 less and has a way better sound!

Good uses: timer, alarm clock, bluetooth speaker to carry around the house during chores. ",
"S. Clyde","May 29, 2016 ",5.0,"Snagged this a while back for a great deal ($50) and have been really happy with it. I have 2 Echos as well and love Alexa in general; I use it a lot to play music around the house and control the lights, etc. This one is my floater and is particularly handy. I keep the dock in my office, in arms reach when I'm at the computer. It automatically connects to the bluetooth on my computer when docked. I frequently take it off the dock and carry it around the house with me when I'm doing chores or just lounging in a room that doesn't already have an Echo. It's kind of ridiculous, because I have whole-home audio (a speaker in the ceiling in every room as part of a home automation system), but this is infinitely more convenient because of the voice control.    My only gripe is that there is no setting to enable touch-less voice control while it's docked. It hasn't been a huge issue because I keep it within arms reach and otherwise have Echos throughout the house, but it would be really nice to have the option. ",
Walk3rt,"September 5, 2016 ",3.0,"But for its size, this thing ROCKS! The accustics are amazing for its size, sound that you'd expect from a small soda can sized Bose speaker would sound. You cant expect a ton of bass, when the speaker inside is barley 2-3 inches, but sounds AMAZING FOR ITS SIZE!  P.s. please dont be stupid and expect this speaker to respond to just saying &#34;Alexa&#34;, its called TAP... It is in the name! As far as listening goes though, she has never miss heard what it is im saying/asking.  I Dont recommend buying this version OVER the normal stationary Echo though, if you dont have one already.  A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SMART HOME ENTHUSIASTS! LOVE MINE!    **To Amazon**  Would be great if I could control my Tap from my Echo and play synchronized music through both devices.  UPDATE: I GOT THEM TO PLAY A SONG TOGETHER!!!!! IT IS POSSIBLE TO SYNC THE TWO!!! ",
Jeremy,"February 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought this before I got my Echo, just to see if the sound quality and Alexa were what they were cracked up to be: all I say is Wow! The Tap is the greatest. My daughter loves it too...she can take it off the charging base in my room and take it in her room to listen to &#34;kids bop radio&#34; while she plays..and can adjust the volume without having to put her Barbies down . I have an Echo now, but this stays on my nightstand...mainly for ocean and thunderstorm sound while I'm going to sleep, and I can get my news, sports, and weather while I'm going around the house and getting ready for work. You did good Amazon! ",
"Matthew Morse","April 9, 2016 ",5.0,"I really, really wanted to like this speaker. I truly did. I have several bluetooth speakers by Bose, a bluetooth-enabled soundbar from Vizio (not in the same class, but still) and I have some other, larger radios with bluetooth adapters, etc. This isn't meant to brag but is meant to show you that I've got plenty of experience with these types of devices from various manufacturers.    Needing a smallish bluetooth speaker for my office, I was initially interested in the Amazon Echo, but snagged this speaker as an Open Box item for a song and figured it would be a great way to enter the world of Alexa and have something small and unobtrusive for my desk at work.    So what do I like about this speaker?    It's small. It's light. It's portable. It's well made. It looks nice, blending in with my office perfectly. It's rechargeable. It's wifi-enabled so I don't need to stream from my phone. I can ask it silly questions about the weather and news and stuff. The battery life seems impressive although to be fair I haven't spent a TON of time with it off the dock. It has an aux port for non-bluetooth-enabled connections. And it has bluetooth connection for devices that contain music that you want to stream through the device. Alexa responds well. Set-up is a breeze and there's a mountain of useful functionality built in from playing music to ordering pizza to things as simple as telling me about the weather or what time it is. It has useful external controls for volume, play/pause and forward/back.    Seems pretty great, right? Kinda...    Some things I don't like are the fact that you have to push a button to get it to listen to you rather than just shouting out, &#34;HEY ALEXA!&#34; Like, this speaker is totally hands-free, but not. It's a weird juxtaposition that I need to be near the device to make it do what I want it to do, which means I can't park it on a bookshelf across the office or whatever. Bummer. But for what I paid, it's a small niggle.    But where this speaker really, really fails for me and where I can't forgive it, is in the sound quality department. In a word: AWFUL. It's tinny, small, flat and lacking in definition. This is quite clearly not a speaker for listening to music, at least not with any punch.    Amazon was focused on the AI aspect of this speaker, which is fine as long as you don't mind having to remain within arm's reach of the speaker in order to utilize these features. But if you plan to use it as a device for listening to music, look elsewhere. Maybe the Echo Dot would be a better option as it will hook up to your existing speaker and give you all the awesome Alexa features. Or spend the extra $50 and get a full on Amazon Echo. ",
"James H Vice","March 4, 2017 ",5.0,"I bought this for experimental purpose only, in conjunction with my Echo. OMG. The sound quality is unbelievable. 3D.  My favorite album is Pink Floyd &#34;The Wall&#34;. Pink Floyd is an audio intense band, I am blown away of the response and quality from a complex format as Pink Floyd's quadraphonic sounds coming through this tap, seriously, I was amazed.  I was sceptical in the beginning, but as I type, listening to &#34;The Wall&#34;, I will become advocate of the tap.  Now let's talk about the connectivity, this is bluetooth and WiFi ready, and connected to Alexa ....get one, you will not be disappointed, that is why I am typing, ",
jsto,"October 14, 2016 ",2.0,"This is the one Echo device that I was struggling to decide if I really had a good use for but Amazon just breathed new life into the Tap with the firmware update, allowing voice activation without touching the speaker. This drains the battery pretty quickly if you don't have it plugged in but I think both the speaker and the listening microphones perform better than the dot. ",
PublicPersona,"October 11, 2016 ",5.0,"Maybe I'll change my rating after more experience with it, but I've got to say first impression is a little disappointing. I should have paid closer attention to this being smaller than the Echo. It really is smaller, and as a result the sound is nowhere near as good as the Echo. And I never realized until I used it for a while that having to tap the button is more inconvenient than I was thinking. The battery charger is not induction as I assumed; there are actually contacts which over time could become corroded. Finally, when the Echo is listening, the circular light pattern on the top is cool, and of course Tap doesn't do that.    So I think what I'm saying is that Tap made me like my Echo even more. The Tap is to meet the specific need of battery operation. So all in all, it's OK. ",
nkmiami,"April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I have had this for about a year now, and really liked it at first because I could take it outside to play music using BT, but now that they've added the Alexa voice activation to this unit, too I absolutely love it.  Now I have the best of both worlds in a small unit that doesn't need to be plugged in.  Way to go Amazon! ",
"Amazon Customer","August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"Receive the Tap for Christmas, mistakenly as the gifter had meant to order an Echo.    The first thing that struck me is the sound quality is very poor. It's a very tinny sound with no depth whatsoever and struggles from mid-volume and beyond.  It's nowhere near a Bose Mini Link and there are better speakers for less. The second was that you have to press the button to ask it anything, this renders the whole device obsolete if as a speaker the sound quality is poor and you have to constantly press a button.    Returned the Tap the next day and am waiting for the Echo to be restocked. ",
shorty,"March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"I've had this Tap about 7 months... I take it to work to listen to my podcasts, as I drive for a living. But the blue tooth just stopped playing... it still connects but won't play at any volume level... but it still responds to voice commands. ",
"Amazon Customer","January 5, 2017 ",1.0,"Worked fine in limited use for several months.  Then music suddenly stopped playing, or would delay for several minutes before playing.

Now, after a 4th customer service try (this one via chat), I am supposedly getting a new replacement.    Hopefully this one will work. ",
"David Allen","March 26, 2017 ",5.0,"I am very excited about the possibilities of the Amazon Tap!  It has joined my ever growing line of Amazon products (I have an Echo and two Dots).    It was packed well and delivered as promised on the release date.  I opened it up, unpacked it and the battery had 77% so I just went ahead and set it up.  The set up was super easy because I already had the Alexa app on my iPhone so I just connected it up with my Amazon Prime account and voila it worked!  I do like that you have to push the button to talk to Alexa on this device.  It is super easy to use.    My pros for this device:  It is PORTABLE!  I can now take my amazon music with me wherever I go!  (well, as long as there is a wifi somewhere to connect).  Pro number 2 is I can connect this up to any wifi wherever I am at.  I don't have to be on my home network!  Perfect!  I can connect my Bluetooth products!!!  Huge plus here because I can use my old iPod to play music when I can't find a wifi or if I don't want to stream off of my phone.  This product lets me be on the go!  The sound is awesome for a product of this size too!  It has a deep rich sounding base and gives a nice field of sound!  Streaming music sounds great as well as my connected toys.  Alexa is always a plus and I like that I can carry her around with me (on vacation) and have her at my beck and call - just like at my house!  The new charging base is good too because you just set your Tap into the base to charge (see cons below) so it is ready anytime you are to run out of the house.    Cons:  Well, my biggest con is not exactly with the Tap.  It is with the sling that Amazon sells for the Tap (I wrote a review on the sling page too).  Once you put on the sling you can no longer sit the Tap on the charging cradle unless you take it off.  The sling itself is a great addition to the Tap because it will protect your Tap against accidental tumbles and is well padded on the top and bottom.  The sling also has a nifty little hole/loop at the top so you can hang it up somewhere to enjoy your music.  I just wish they would have designed this so it worked with the charging base.  The work around is to use the micro usb and just plug it directly into the Tap to charge it.  OK, so this is minor and not worth taking a star off of the Tap itself but I did give the sling only 4 stars.    So far I have played hours of music on it and peppered Alexa with multiple questions and the battery is still holding firm.  It trickles down - not a power guzzler like some other products I've tried.  If this or anything changes I will update my review.    Overall the Tap seems to be a well made and easy to use addition to the multiple Amazon line of products.  The design team did a great job of putting this together and making sure the buttons are all in easy to access locations.  The sound is great!  It is a bit pricey for a small speaker (I think they should have marketed this around the $99 price point) but I don't mind as long as it works as expected.  I don't think you can go wrong on this little toy so enjoy!  Recommended! ",
RK,"April 18, 2017 ",1.0,"This little item is awesome.  Once the hands free option loaded, I finished the setup and &#34;Alexa&#34; follows me throughout my home.  The sound is amazing for such a small piece.  I like that all of my previous settings with the Echo are available in the Tap as well.  Well worth the price! ",
"Julia N.","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"Terrible product. It loses connection constantly and when you speak to it, it does nothing. We must have gotten a faulty one or something. When it is connected, the speakers are awesome, but it's worthless because it doesn't stay. ",
"L. Freese","March 17, 2017 ",5.0,"Nice volume, place it in the corner of a wall and it really goes to town with the sound.

Lodro,"December 25, 2016 ",1.0,"I honestly don't know what this is meant to do. It doesn't respond well to commands so I've limited it to playing music and half the time I have to spend 5 minutes just getting it to pick up my phone's bluetooth signal. There's better speakers out there. ",
"David Price","March 13, 2017 ",5.0,"Enabling Amazon Prime Unlimited really made this an amazon a great device!

"Dom Villari","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I &#34;echo&#34; the other comments....there appears to be an issue with the wifi. It disconnects regularly and not I can't even get the bluetooth to pair. However, the biggest issue is that after numerous searches on Amazon and Google I can't even figure out how to get support for this device. There are plenty of a articles but no where I can find to actually contact Amazon for support or warrantee, other than simply calling a main number and trying to get to right person. From what I see in the reviews, Amazon does not seem to have addressed anyone with comments about the wifi. Like the others I also have an Echo and a Dot, neither of which have any problems connecting. It's just the Tap. ",
Edgar,"August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"I was interested in the Echo, but am glad I waited for the Tap, much better fit to what I wanted, and overall almost everything I wanted out of a networked house speaker.    First, the good points. It is rechargeable and portable, meaning I can take it off the base to take with me. You hook it up to your wifi but it also can be paired as a bluetooth speaker. The latter is useful for getting over some of Alexa's current limitations, although Amazon really needs to work on those if they want this to be relevant against Sonos and Google entries. Based on their response on the Fire TV, I am optimistic.    I also like that you have to press the speaker button to have voice recognition turn on, I was not a fan of a device constantly listening for commands, little too much privacy invasion. Response to voice is impressive, good for news, sports, weather, and of course music. That being said, plan on using your Pandora account (free or paid), if you have paid Spotify, or ideally Amazon Prime audio. Have not explored the others yet and looking forward to more options.    That said, here are the major limitations of this device, ones that are easily software repairable and realistically fatal flaws in my opinion. I see where Amazon is trying to use this to push their services, but I already have Prime and should not have to pay extra from more Prime music storage. By this I mean my personal music collection, which 1. I should be able to stream directly from a networked computer or NAS, currently cannot, or 2. I should be able to access online at services like Google Music, rather than pay $25/yr to upload another version on Amazon Music (above the first free 250 songs.) These are two major issues what will put Tap and Echo at a disadvantage in the market and give their competitors an advantage. Now, Amazon had the similar limitations and issues with Firetv when it launched, giving Roku and Chromecast more flexibility, but with upgrades they fixed and allowed third part apps like Kodi to fill the void. We need the same with Tap and Echo.    Good news is Amazon Prime music has a great collection of artists you get free access to with Prime membership. I tell it to play The Doors and it goes through a very good selection of songs available as part of Prime, or something like 1970's mix, or alternative mix. Or I can say play Pandora James Morrison and get a station from my account of similar artists. The bad is I can only upload 250 additional songs from my collection without paying additional subscriptions (for some stuff not available on these services). Even worse, why should I waste bandwith streaming a song I own and have on my local network to get it over the internet, I should be able to have my local database searchable and playable.    Now the Bluetooth does fill this gap, I can set up a tablet to control and stream off my NAS, but then I lose the convenience of Alexa and of course need one more device in the mix. Alternatively, I already have my collection on my Google Music cloud, how do we get that to work? Last resort is increasing the free storage for Amazon music to prime members, or at least make an in between bracket for the subscription model, less than 250,000 songs at a significantly lower price upgrade, say $5/yr for every 50k songs added. Realistically, Prime membership at $99/yr should already include music upload, charging more is just poor taste specifically when Google and others charge nothing, hard to justify that business model.    Ok, ranting aside, hoping ideally for access to local music shares, and ideally user developed apps for Tap and Echo. But for what we are using it for its a great device, good price point, excellent sound and versatility. ",
"Amazon Customer","March 8, 2017 ",1.0,"I bought this as a gift for my music lover husband. He LOVES IT!!! We downloaded the app and went through the instructions, it was a simple process.

We even enjoy the jokes! One thing for which I am very thankful is the durability. My husband has knocked this of the table and it has shown no damage and no detriment to the sound quality.

"Mr. M. P. Clinton","March 3, 2017 ",5.0,"Having an Echo and a Dot, while on holiday in America I bought a Tap for portability. Couldn't get it to work at the hotel, which I suspected was due to the hotel wifi being open BUT taking you to a landing page to log in to gain net access.    However, now home I find even after numerous factory resets, and uninstalling and reinstalling apps, it just doesn't work. Orange lights glow and goes into setup mode, using iphone or android phone app I connect to the Tap, and Tap actually says 'connected to tap'....however, the next step to connect it to my home wifi just never progresses, the app just spins and spins...on a PC browser from alexa.amazon.com, it says 'Wait until Tap says you are connected, then continue.' Continue?? HOW??    Trawling through the comments, it seems I'm not alone, so there seems to be some kind of error in the wifi of Tap devices that the Echo and Dots just don't have. Maybe it's some weird setup in my router it doesn't like (My wifi is only 2.4ghz, so its not the 2.5 / 5ghz issue), but WHAT that might be is anyone's guess. A real shame, as this device tarnishes the Alexa brand. ",
"Mark Pereira","June 23, 2016 ",5.0,"Five star with the new update. A portable Alexa is a great thing to have. It follows me everywhere I have a project to work on around the house.

Sure hope it lasts longer than this debacle of a product. Needless to say I won't be buying any more Alexa's. In summary: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on a product with a lifespan of a few months. ",
Wonder,"March 31, 2017 ",5.0,"Update #2:    Great: new &#34;always-listening&#34; mode availability, making the Amazon Tap a portable Alexa (with lesser quality speakers and listeners, however still quite effective and certainly more capable than the Dot)    Awful: TWELVE MONTHS and NO IMPROVEMENTS on the NOISE.  The Tap is still very noisy, including announcing bluetooth dis/connections.  Very awful.    -----------------------------------------------------------    Update #1:    I expected some basic civilized software updates, yet over 9 months later, horrifyingly, bluetooth notification sounds STILL cannot be turned off nor can they their volume be turned down unless you power off the entire device AND keep it off of the charger.  The Tap loudly proclaims bluetooth connection and disconnection announcements and it couldn't care less if you're sleeping.    4 stars for the device in general, -10 stars for the lack of ability to turn off or turn down bluetooth notifications.  I've had three Taps; this is not a glitch, it is an irresponsible programming disaster.  This issue has been going on since the device was first released and the software engineers should be embarrassed to not have created the ability to turn off or turn down volume on the notifications, especially so many months later!    -----------------------------------------------------------    Initial review:    The big difference between the Amazon Echo and the Echo Tap -- besides that the Amazon Echo is always listening for its wake word and the Echo Tap requires a button-push to activate communication -- is that the Echo Tap is noisy while the Amazon Echo is elegantly quiet, indicating listening and responsiveness through light rather than sound.    Changing the volume on Amazon Echo = beautiful silence, with light indicator  Changing the volume on Echo Tap = noisy beeps/tones for every volume level that's changed    Getting the attention of Amazon Echo by saying wake word = beautiful silence, with light indicator  Getting the attention of Echo Tap by pressing the the button = noisy tone when button is pressed and another noisy tone when the message goes through    Echo Tap also noisily disconnects from bluetooth at unpredictable times, and the volume of Alexa's voice is always much louder than any other media that the Echo Tap was playing.    Otherwise, Echo Tap feels good and the battery life is great and charging base is as convenient as possible. The buttons at the top could have used much better texturizing for more intuitive touch operation, but I'm sure we'll just get used to it by orienting our thumb on the voice-command-activation button.    Will be better when software is updated to allow for &#34;silent&#34; operation. ",

NOT! It does not set up easy when set up it did not stay connected to the internet  the Tap amazon listing would not come up on my Samsung phone so I could connect with the wifi.

Grace,"August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"This device is unreliable. When it is placed in its cradle it works fine. However, after using it for 6 months and seldomly taking it out of its cradle I noticed that it would lose its WIFI connection even though I just moved it a few feet away.    The battery is charged fully each time this has happened, and the WIFI signal is strong. Therefore, I must conclude there is a problem with the device.    Amazon only offered a partial refund after I was passed between 3 customer service representatives.    My assessment is the Amazon Tap, when in its cradle is functional, when not it's unreliable junk that should be avoided.    Try Google's product. ",

Doesn't matter if I'm using the charging base or plugging directly to the tap. Amazon knows this is a common problem and offered to send me a new one. It was nice of them to offer but I think I'll just get an echo. I do like the way the tap speakers sound. We take it camping where we have no internet or cell service, just plug the iPod into the aux jack and it works great. Or connect the iPhone via Bluetooth and play music that way.

"Kindle Customer","March 19, 2017 ",5.0,"I love my Tap.  From some of the reviews it would appear that people didn't think about the name when they bought it,  so they were disappointed.  I don't mind tapping it to turn it on.  Setting it up was nothing much more than opening the box and connecting to WiFi.  I ordered an range sling and it hangs on an S-hook on my headboard.  I set alarms,  check the weather,  question when the Red Sox will be playing, etc.  And,  I play music from my Prime library and other sources.  It is wonderful to set a timer when I am cooking because I can hear it.  The case is usually on it,  but it comes off easily enough and goes back on easily.  Plugging in the charging cable is no problem with the case on,  as I prefer it hanging where I can reach it easily more than I would care to have it on the charging cable.  Either way,  one or the other has to be plugged in.  I love to listen to Audible books to help me get to sleep,  so that is another thing I use it for.  Random questions can be answered so easily.  I love my Tap so much that I just bought an Echo to use in my kitchen and living room area.  I like the voice activation feature for that area.  Basically,  I think Amazon is the greatest.  I have had Kindles since the second generation,  have a HDX7 and  an HD 10 that I use constantly,  as well as a Fire phone and a Fire stick.  Service is incredible.  Prices are reasonable,  especially when the Echo was reduced in price for one day.  Can't wait for it to come next week.  Either Echo it Tap will be a very welcome addition to your home. ",
"R Carter","December 17, 2016 ",3.0,"I am now on my 3rd Tap, and if it were not for Amazon having the most excellent customer service that I have ever had to deal with, I would only give the Tap itself 1 star. As I said I am on my 3rd tap, The first tap lasted me a month then just refused to hold a charge. I've never abused it, I do use it every day to listen to various internet radio service but hey I use my kindle Fire every single day I seldom ever turn off the kindle fire and I have had no problems what so ever with kindle fire. So what gives with this tap? Why are there battery issues? So anyways when Tap #1 refused to charge, Amazon customer service helped me troubleshoot it and when nothing worked they promptly sent me another one. Tap #2 was OK (a refurb I presume) but it had alot of crackling now and then on the sound but otherwise was ok for the past 9 months. Over the weekend Tap # 2 just died, I got no sound out of it at all though it showed on the app that it was hearing me, then it refused to charge, so I put it on charge for 24 hours and it said the battery was full but it promptly died as soon as I unplugged it, I again called on Tech support and we did all the trouble shooting but no deal its dead they promptly sent me another Tap. So, today I have received Tap#3 lets hope this one lasts. If I had it to do over, I would have just ordered the amazon echo Dot and bought a good sounding portable bluetooth speaker instead. ",
Matttom88,"April 19, 2016 ",5.0,"Loved this speaker so much until around 6 months in and it stopped pairing with all my devices most of the time and when it does connect it only stays connected for a few minutes before it just turns off again. I decided to just use the AUX cable but now that isn't even working. What a piece of crap and I wish I had saved my money ",
"DJ 815","April 19, 2017 ",3.0,"My only bad Amazon experience so I can't complain too much but this product is well below amazons usual high standards.  Numerous problems - losing wifi connection constantly; sometimes answers a question sometimes doesn't ; sometimes red buttons blink and it says ask later.  Customer service seems ill equipped to deal with technical issues and gave me multiple different answers (none of which worked)  to the same questions and supervisors are not available.  Amazon needs to do better before selling a product like this - it's a recipe for lowering the reputation of its good name. ",
"Amazon Customer","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I read a lot of the reviews primarily the negative ones about this device. A lot of the complaints were that you had to press the button to have it do anything and I can understand their logic. But this was designed to be a portable device and it works very well at that.    Now as to why I purchased the Tap. I had been purchasing items from Amazon for over 10 years and recently joined Amazon Prime. I had just purchased a new smart TV and figured the video streaming and free shipping made this a good deal. I started exploring what else came with my Prime membership and saw Prime Music. I really only listen to music while I am in my car and have never owned any portable digital music devices. The only exception being my iPhone which I used for phone, email and web browsing. When I discovered what I was able to access with my Prime membership I was hooked. I quickly put together a play list of some mellow music from the 60's and early 70's and thought this would be great to play for thanksgiving when I would have all of my family over. I knew that what ever I purchased would be moving between at least 2 rooms, so I needed something portable. It was 2 days till Thanksgiving and time was running out and I didn't have time to research hundreds of devices. I new that the Amazon Echo devices could connect to Amazon Prime Music so it was a matter  of choosing which one. It boiled down to the Echo or the Tap, I ended up choosing the Tap because it was less expensive and it was portable. I know I could have easily moved the Echo between rooms but I also knew there were going to be times when I would not be near power or want to run power outside. So the tap it was and I ordered it with next day delivery.    After working all day Wednesday then running around like a mad man getting the fresh bird, rolls, pies and the few things that I had forgotten. I finally arrive home and there is this small box from Amazon. I already knew from an email that Amazon sent me the day before what would be needed to setup the tap. I had downloaded the Alexa app to my  iPhone and had my wireless access code available. I plugged in the Tap's charger and set the tap in the charger. I then started the Alexa App on my phone and linked the Tap to my Amazon account. Then I pressed the Bluetooth button on the tap for about 5 seconds which started it's setup mode. Opened my phones wireless settings and connected to the Tap's wireless network. Then from the Alexa app I selected my wireless network and entered my wireless network access code. Setup complete in under 5 minutes. First command pressed the button and said &#34;Play Thanksgiving play list&#34; and the gods said let there be music.    Thanksgiving Day the Tap was a big hit with the family.  Most didn't even realize that the sound was coming from the Tap they kept looking around the room asking where the speaker was until I pointed my finger at the Tap. Everyone was amazed at the sound that came out of it. It is not a Bose audio system but the sound quality was more than good enough for my family and I.    Now a couple of warnings.    1) These devices are very addictive. Once you see what you can do with it you will be hooked. This technology is so cool and it is still in it's infancy.  2) Jeff Bezos is a genius. He created Amazon Prime so people would sign up for free shipping. Then provided Prime Music and Prime Video. Next came Alexa and the Echo's. He got me HOOK, LINE AND SINKER.    Now a couple of negative things.    1) At the beginning of this post I mentioned the negative comments about having to press the button to activate the Tap. There is a work around to this problem. The Echo Tap has an audio input and the Echo Dot has an audio output. You can plug the output from the Echo Dot into the Tap and output the Dot's audio to the Tap and you can now do this by using the name Alexa to wake the device. Yes you have just turned your Tap into just a speaker. But you can now use voice commands without pressing a button.    2) You are able to set timers and alarms. The issue that most people complain about is the same issue I have. You cannot set the alarm to wake you with music. Though there is a very outside the box work aroung. You can set an alarm on your smart phone using a custom file that say's Alexa play Beatles or whatever.    The Echo family of devices are an awesome product and I would recommend them to anyone looking to stream music or do Home Automation. The Jetson's are coming. ",
"D. Kelley","August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"My opinion of the device is getting better as I play with it. I'm still ambivalent about its sound quality. It appears to have a &#34;power band&#34; at which it sounds best (around 7). As you raise the volume above, the bass dampens and the sound becomes thinner. I also hear the stereo separation when its within 1-2 feet of me. It'd be nice if one could output the sound to other speakers in addition to having it receive line-in from other devices. It also sounds best when hooked to WiFi and streaming Amazon music you purchased. The volume of the Bluetooth connection has less quality and it doesn't play the stream as loudly.    Having it read my Kindle book through text-to-speech is really good. It interprets the words well; much better than the original Kindle ever did (yes, the 2nd gen had that feature). Without specifying, it recognized the last book I was reading and starting reading from where I left off on my Kindle PaperWhite. Cool!    Setup was incredibly simple.    I'm still learning all that Alexa can do, but it's nice thus far. ",
"Shannan McMullen","December 7, 2016 ",4.0,"I love this Amazon product. I was given the Amazon Tap as a present and use this product everyday. The speaker is loud and clear. Can also be used to set a slightly warmer mood as well.  Make sure you download the Alexa app on your phone, and most of you would be surprised what this product can do!  Also, this product basically tells you what it is...  for those who bought this product and we're dissatisfied, Amazon Tap. Tap, you do know what that means right? You have to tap the speaker button on the Tap and Alexa will listen. ",
"Craig M. Reed","July 15, 2016 ",4.0,"LOUD sound for such a small speaker.  What's great about this vs. a standard Bluetooth speaker is it can be used independently​ when on Wi-Fi.  No need to also carry a 2nd device around to keep the music playing.  Not o ly that, of course you get the smarts of Amazon voice control Echo service.  Can't wait to take it pool side without a drain on my phone. ",
R,"December 10, 2016 ",5.0,"This device is wonderful. It works for me as a never-set talking alarm clock. I can set alarms and the alarm won't shut up until you ask it to. This is good, because I am a deep sleeper. I also use it as a portable stereo with my Amazon Music collection. I can have it play some ethereal music before bed, and listen to my music through the day. The sound is very good. Some have said the bass is weak? I don't listen to music that is bass heavy, so I don't really care about that. For those who feel there is no remote control of the device while listening to music? This is not true. If you go to the Alexa app, and go to &#34;Now Playing&#34; you can control volume, play/pause, and backwards/forwards track skipping. You can also gain access to your listening history, and control your listening without your voice, by tapping on an item in History under Now Playing. You can also control the device volume from the Alexa app. I also use this as a news aggregator for sources like CNN and NPR and WSJ. The add-on skills are very nice. I use the Focus Word add-on to help me throughout the day. This can also track my orders, which is pretty neat. Alexa is the one to thank all of this. She is one heck of a woman, and with so many things being taught to her, I suspect she will only get better. Another thing that I use this for is a talking book player. I can ask Alexa to read a kindle book, tell her the title, and she starts reading. Getting the weather and using Wikipedia are equally as easy. Last but not least, I use it as a Bluetooth speaker with my smart phone. One final note: some have complained about the requirement of tapping the microphone button to get to Alexa. I consider this a plus, as I am fully aware of when the device is, and is not listening. I feel that is better than having to worry about the Echo thinking you said Alexa, when you didn't. I highly highly recommend this to anyone looking for a portable powerhouse. Alexa? Keep up the good work and keep learning. You are doing awesome. :) ",
"Terri Alexander","April 4, 2017 ",5.0,"This product is absolutely amazing! The sound quality is great and can go very loud! If you use Spotify you can tap the button and simply ask her to play one of your playlists and she plays that playlist. This speaker is very portable and even if you do not have internet to hook it up to you can pair any device wirelessly as long as the device has bluetooth capability. Connecting devices is very simple you push the bluetooth button located on the speaker and it will tell you that the speaker is ready to pair! Unlike a lot of other wireless speakers you can go pretty far away from the speaker with your device and still get great sound quality! You can do just about anything you can do on Amazon Echo, the only real difference I see is that you have to push a button before you say anything. Other than that you get the same great quality as you do with Amazon Echo you can ask just about any question  and get a reliable answer. The sound quality is impeccable, it is really clear and stays clear no matter what the volume is at. There are always new updates with even more incredible features that come out each week! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone! ",
"David M","September 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I have both an Alexa Echo and the Tap.  They both get used all day everyday.  I have not seen any issues with either device unless I try to ask an obscure question.  Battery life has been fine on the Tap, and I carry it around the house.  Echo Stays in our open main floor near the kitchen.  It's great for company, letting people ask Alexa to play whatever music they want while we're cooking dinner using it as a hands-free timer.    For the Tap, I bought a sleeve and put a Caribeaner on it.  Let's me just hook it to wherever when I'm outside, or on a belt loop if I'm doing stuff like yardwork.    I like that I can connect to Amazon Music, Spotify, Iheartradio or my own music library to listen to ONLY what I want to hear.  You can also get just about any information from either just by asking a clear question.    Both are Brilliant additions to any home! ",
Danita,"May 17, 2016 ",5.0,"I love this thing! I was torn between this and echo but since my family is on the go we figured let's take the portable option. Best choice ever. Not only is it portable but durable which is great for my rough and tumble sons. ",
"Sunny Gal","November 18, 2016 ",5.0,"Pros:  I love the Tap.  It's a nice size and the quality of the sound is great.  I bought it primarily because I want to listen to Audible books - I'm hooked on Outlander.  Listened to Pandora and the sound was crisp and clear.  Can't wait to take the Tap out when I will be spending time away from home.    Cons:  I unfortunately spoke to a technician who didn't have correct information as to how to set it up.  He told me to connect it through my Kindle Fire - WRONG!!!  The outcome was my wifi network kicked the Kindle out and I couldn't sign up again.  The technician told me I would get a phone call the next day from someone who could help.  Never did get a phone call.  I called again and this time I was lucky enough to get a technician who knew what to do.  He told me to connect it through my iMac desk top.  After following the correct steps I was up and running in less than 5 minutes.  Pity that when you ask for help you never know if the technician is competent until you are either completely screwed up, or up and running. ",
"Mark Shepherd","June 23, 2016 ",5.0,"I like this speaker, especially the fact that it connects to wifi. Good sound for its size and easily portable. There are some glitches that need to be worked out, however. I've had to do a reset on it twice for two different reasons. The first was when I was getting the &#34;low battery&#34; warning even after it had been sitting on the charging dock for days. I checked the plug and everything was fine. I double checked the plug and everything was fine. I stopped getting the warning after the reset. The second time was after I had used the auxiliary input to watch a movie on my laptop. Latter in the day when trying to listen to music through the Alexa app it kept showing that it was still connected to the auxiliary port and wouldn't let me control music through the app. After several trouble shooting steps I finally resorted to doing a reset, which worked. Other than those two quirks it's been a great little speaker. ",
Lodro,"April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"I honestly don't know what this is meant to do. It doesn't respond well to commands so I've limited it to playing music and half the time I have to spend 5 minutes just getting it to pick up my phone's bluetooth signal. There's better speakers out there. ",
Krahnin,"August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"Pros:  - More portable than it's big brother - the echo.  - Pretty good sound quality for a speaker this size.  - Alexa enabled (number of 3rd party connections and its voice recognition are constantly improving).  - Battery life is more than adequate for general use.    Cons:  - Device seems to turn itself on randomly after it has been put to sleep. I sometimes pull it out only to find the battery is dead.  - Alexa is ONLY available via the &#34;tap&#34; button. I understand that this is to improve battery life and push sales to the Echo, but I personally think it should be an option to enable hands-free voice recognition. For instance, if I am working outside or working out in my garage/mini gym, I do not want to get the thing dirty by touching it and also would not be in an ideal location for an Echo. I would be happy with reduced battery life if I had the option to enable hands-free voice recognition for the instances it is needed. ",
"Mr HH","October 24, 2016 ",1.0,"Great as echo BUT I don't like that I have to press the button in order to give a command. In other words I can't make work without a touch like the brother Amazon Echo. I love my Echo. It's mobile but within your WIFI environment only.  The word Alexa will not make it wake up. You must touch the button. ",
"tristan espiritu","August 16, 2016 ",4.0,"I have the regular echo and love it. This tap is awesome for when we're in the yard or patio. Size is just right. Set up took a couple of minutes. Volume levels are good enough for small outdoor gatherings. Took some getting used to not having to say Alexa as compared to the echo but that's a minor nit. Battery has lasted as long as we've needed outside and recharging it is a breeze especially if you don't have a cover on. Echo products now have Spotify but you have to be a premium Spotify member to be able to use it directly. Work around for this on the tap is the BlueTooth connectivity where you can run Spotify though you phone app, which is great. ",
cyber,"April 21, 2016 ",3.0,"I just received mine yesterday. I have an Echo and love it.  This Tap is an excellent addition to the Alexia Amazon system.  Setup was easy, the sound is excellent from a small unit.  Very portable. Can easily move room to room.  Pressing the tap button becomes routine to control it.  So I say buy it if you like your Echo and want to carry it room to room.  I will also be using this unit on the road when RVing. It perfect for the traveler too.  I must also add the quality of the product is excellent as in every Amazon product. ",
"Brian Chastain","June 10, 2016 ",5.0,"I now own an Amazon Echo, two Dots and an Amazon Tap.  I must say, I think I like the Tap the best.    The Tap is smaller than the Echo, the battery life is amazing, and the speaker is great.  I love being able to pick it up and carry it from room to room.  I can have it in the kitchen when I'm doing dishes, the laundry room when I'm doing laundry, and the bathroom when I'm showering.    I stream music and radio stations, but I also like to listen to podcasts.  Whatever your needs, the Tap works very well.    With the latest upgrade, you no longer HAVE to push the microphone button to speak with Alexa.  I don't enable that however, as it will drain the battery more quickly.  With that functionality off, I find the battery lasts me all week if I listen to music, etc., an hour or two a day.    I can't recommend this enough! ",
Akiva,"November 29, 2016 ",5.0,"Returned my UE Roll in favor with Alexa! Very easy to use just by tapping and asking Alexa. Great sound quality. Took 1-star because Apple Music is not there yet, ended up with Spotify & Pandora, and lets face it. For some reason Apply Music sounds far better than the two. Pls make Apple Music available!  FYI, Alexa is smarter than Siri 😉 now I'm curious with Echo 🤓 ",
"Raymond Cerrone","March 29, 2017 ",5.0,"This is a nice gadget.  That's about all I can say that is positive.  The sound quality extremely poor when the volume is turned up more than half-way.  If you are looking for bass, then look elsewhere.    I am a big fan of the Echo.  When this toy hit the market I bought it out of curiosity.  I was contemplating returning the item, but I like gadgets and can come up with a use for the Tap.    I am giving a three star rating but that is being generous. ",
"Chuck Armstrong","June 19, 2016 ",4.0,"If you like to crank it up go get a JBL or Bose. I don't crank it up so this is perfect for me with my Amazon Prime music account. Fantastic battery life.

I fell asleep while reading, and when I woke up the next morning, the music was still playing. ",
"David Allen","April 14, 2016 ",3.0,"I am very excited about the possibilities of the Amazon Tap!  It has joined my ever growing line of Amazon products (I have an Echo and two Dots).    It was packed well and delivered as promised on the release date.  I opened it up, unpacked it and the battery had 77% so I just went ahead and set it up.  The set up was super easy because I already had the Alexa app on my iPhone so I just connected it up with my Amazon Prime account and voila it worked!  I do like that you have to push the button to talk to Alexa on this device.  It is super easy to use.    My pros for this device:  It is PORTABLE!  I can now take my amazon music with me wherever I go!  (well, as long as there is a wifi somewhere to connect).  Pro number 2 is I can connect this up to any wifi wherever I am at.  I don't have to be on my home network!  Perfect!  I can connect my Bluetooth products!!!  Huge plus here because I can use my old iPod to play music when I can't find a wifi or if I don't want to stream off of my phone.  This product lets me be on the go!  The sound is awesome for a product of this size too!  It has a deep rich sounding base and gives a nice field of sound!  Streaming music sounds great as well as my connected toys.  Alexa is always a plus and I like that I can carry her around with me (on vacation) and have her at my beck and call - just like at my house!  The new charging base is good too because you just set your Tap into the base to charge (see cons below) so it is ready anytime you are to run out of the house.    Cons:  Well, my biggest con is not exactly with the Tap.  It is with the sling that Amazon sells for the Tap (I wrote a review on the sling page too).  Once you put on the sling you can no longer sit the Tap on the charging cradle unless you take it off.  The sling itself is a great addition to the Tap because it will protect your Tap against accidental tumbles and is well padded on the top and bottom.  The sling also has a nifty little hole/loop at the top so you can hang it up somewhere to enjoy your music.  I just wish they would have designed this so it worked with the charging base.  The work around is to use the micro usb and just plug it directly into the Tap to charge it.  OK, so this is minor and not worth taking a star off of the Tap itself but I did give the sling only 4 stars.    So far I have played hours of music on it and peppered Alexa with multiple questions and the battery is still holding firm.  It trickles down - not a power guzzler like some other products I've tried.  If this or anything changes I will update my review.    Overall the Tap seems to be a well made and easy to use addition to the multiple Amazon line of products.  The design team did a great job of putting this together and making sure the buttons are all in easy to access locations.  The sound is great!  It is a bit pricey for a small speaker (I think they should have marketed this around the $99 price point) but I don't mind as long as it works as expected.  I don't think you can go wrong on this little toy so enjoy!  Recommended! ",

When I first got the Tap it took me 4 hours to set it up. It would not sync with my cellphone or connected to my wifi. I spent SO much time on the phone with Amazon before they were finally able to fix it. Fast forward several months down the line and again it won't connect to my wifi or play my music selection when i press the button. I have to go to Amazon.com/Alexa and choose my music selection from there; to which I add that option isn't working either. I would not recommend this product to ANYONE, it's challenging to sync, and it often loses the the connection to your wifi.    I wish I would have sent this back within the first 30 days.

"Isabelle S.","March 7, 2017 ",1.0,"We got the tap because my husband wanted a Bluetooth speaker for the car. We were about to buy one of the cheaper Bose speakers when I noticed that the Tap was only a little more money, yet it did so much more. This was our first time with a device like this one as we do not have an Echo. We are very impressed.    Car:  He was happy as can be with it in the car. He is driving our 2011 RAV4, which is Not a quiet ride. He is very pleased with the level of sound out of the Tap. With the cover, it fits in the cup holder and he is able to listen to his podcasts perfectly well while driving. He is pleased.    At home:  We found that the Tap will pair both with my iPhone and my husbands, and it will adapt to both of us. Unlike my dear Midwestern husband, I have a foreign accent. From the first moment, Alexa was able to understand me. I said &#34;find Canciones de mi padre by Linda Rondstat in prime music&#34; and it did! No wondering what in the world I said. I'm majorly impressed by its capability. It understands my five year old too when he speaks slowly. I'm glad Alexa tells jokes unlike Siri. This is a source of amusement, of course.    I find that it is loud enough for our house. I'm glad prime music has music for all our tastes, that range from jazz, to Latin, to Sesame Street. Because it pairs using Bluetooth we can listen to free library books. I have an audible account and it will play from there too, it will read your kindle books to you. And again, Alexa understands my accent which is very impressive.    What I didn't expect:  Well, maybe I didn't read every word on the long Amazon description. But it didn't realize we needed to download the Alexa app to our phones to pair the device, add &#34;skills&#34; (like apps), and for general Tap setup. The cover, sold separately, does not allow for the tap to be charged using the cradle.    We are happy and highly recommend it. ",

The Tap has some nice features for $79 (on special as of 12/13/16) like a wireless charging dock and Echo capabilities; but this is not the device for an iPhone and iTunes user as you'll have to transfer calendar data to Google's calendar and download a special To-Do app as it doesn't work with Reminders. Also there is no native Napster streaming so for me, as a Napster paid user, I have to control everything from my iPhone. This would probably be the case for you anyway even excluding Napster users as it is more cumbersome than you might think to always have to press a button for Echo to activate its services.    Pairing to the device is easy but the inability to turn off the audio feedback when pairing is annoying. And stopping a timer or alarm isn't convenient. Couple these drawbacks with poor low frequency sound (bass) and the device has a very limited ideal user.    It is plenty loud and I love the 360 degree sound field but the drawbacks are too significant to overlook.  Keep searching. The UE Boom II is supposed to be excellent however it is $160 as of this writing. ",
"Ms Sumida","August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"I love all things tech and am a bit of a geek.  That said, I hate this device, I absolutely hate it.    There is a massive bluetooth connectivity issue and every time this awful speaker disconnects and re-connects the annoying sounds and even more annoying voice prompts lets you know..EVERY SINGLE TIME.  On top of that, Alexa overrides your level 1 (basic) bluetooth settings so even if you disconnect it from the WiFi, it  re-connects on its own, with the annoying vocal message. You have to go into your main BlueTooth settings to finally get rid ofmit. This became so annoying I removed the device from all my computers and other devices.    The voice recognition is OK at best and does not recognize simple commands such as 'Play Amazon Prime Pop'    As a speaker, it's a bit muddled and muffled.    I do not recommend ",

sexyiiko,"April 16, 2017 ",1.0,"What I love the most about the Amazon TAP is the voice command of adding things to my TODO and shopping lists.  Excellent! Preordered DOT since I can't get enough of the Echo line! Thank you Amazon! ",
"Amazon Customer","April 3, 2017 ",5.0,"Product worked well from Christmas to March. Then started having trouble- won't respond accurately to commands; disconnects from WIFI. Re-booting works temporarily, but problems return. All my other devices on WIFI are working. Only the Amazon Tap is the problem. Blogs say to reboot WIFI. I do not want to disrupt my other devices for this leisure time, non essential toy. I would not buy again. ",
"Gregory Barber","September 27, 2016 ",5.0,"The sounds lags. If you try to connect to a tv it is not useful. I've connected over Bluetooth and also the 3.5 mm jack. Same problem on both. I verified it was not the tv by testing another set of speakers    Otherwise it is a good product and am happy but not sure I'm going to keep it the primary reason I purchased was for the tv and figured the other functions were a bonus over other choices. ",
"Amazon Customer","January 13, 2017 ",2.0,"Have tried for several hours to set-up my Alexa Tap.  Whenever I get to the wi-if connection screen I get an error message stating incorrect password.  My password IS correct.  My iPhone6 screen freezes several times througout the attempted app set-up.  🙁 So so sad because Alexa Tap appears to be a solid product however it's useless because I am not able to use it due to the erroneous wi-fi errors. ",
"Michael Sayegh","April 14, 2017 ",2.0,"If you have the Amazon Echo, then you don't need this. I really wanted to give this a better rating, but isn't at the same quality as the Echo in terms of volume and sound quality. I do appreciate the feedback in the comments about its smart home features, but the Echo has the same features, making this one useless in comparison. It can also be such a pain to pair it after it disconnects ",
kiajor,"December 25, 2016 ",1.0,"What is not to love?  The speaker is very good.  Availability of music and podcasts is fantastic. The making of a grocery list could not be easier.  And the size makes it easy to take anywhere.  I did turn off the automatic purchase option.  But I have friends who would think it was funny to order things on my behalf. ",
"Kindle Customer","July 14, 2016 ",1.0,"Love my Tap. It tells me jokes everyday. It tells me what happened in history on this day. It tells me the weather for whenever you want to know. You can ask her anything and if she knows she'll tell you. It plays music and I use it as my alarm clock. I really enjoy this Tap. ",
"James Aldrich","April 2, 2016 ",5.0,"There are many fine reviews of the Tap written here!  I purchased this speaker first before buying an Echo during prime day!  I purchased the echo since I liked the voice control features rather than tapping the front button on the tap.  I believe the Tap needs a remote control.  I can't see why the echo remote couldn't be used somehow with the tap with some type of upgrade.  I would like to be able to swing in my swing and give the tap a command through a remote and have it execute commands, music, radio stations etc. while I'm not near it. This would be nice while setting a timer, checking shopping lists, calendars and getting information.  I would like to be able to access the speaker from a distance with the echo remote preferably or an Icon in the Alexa App. I think voice listening would be too much for the battery but catching some kind of electronic spike would at least activate it from a short distance so one could give it commands and one could adjust the volume and tracks from a distance. The Tap would be perfect for me with some kind of scheme where one could use it remotely!  It needs a remote control and if the existing echo remote could be made to work, this would be ideal!    Jim ",
AllenJ,"August 16, 2016 ",2.0,"Alexa is great for what she is right now. I think she's still has a long ways to go as far as her answering abilities. Im also still clueless as to why i have to &#34;enable skills&#34;. Why arent they all just automatically enabled since she's cloud based?  Her sound quality for music is outstanding though. I have a Beat Pill as well... And the Tap outdoes it on all levels for music quality. And the wifi range, as well as the Bluetooth range, is amazing. You'll be confused how she gets a signal such a Long Way away from your wifi. ",
"Steve FTW","July 15, 2016 ",4.0,"Fantastic ***as long as your expectations are in line***    Received this toy on Friday and couldn't wait to get it home.  I have an Echo and had read the reviews on Tap, and had my expectation (that it would be slightly less impressive than the Echo).    Set-up was easy, just like the Echo.    Love the portability.  It's very nice to take this into the bathroom while showering and getting ready for work.    Sound quality is great (again, meets expectations).    Small enough to throw in your bag for a weekend trip.    However, what I REALLY like about the Echo is that you can enable voice instructions (through the Echo app) and it basically works like an Echo.  When I stumbled upon this, I REALLY fell in love with the TAP! ",
"Michael D","September 20, 2016 ",4.0,"I really like the Amazon Tap. I've only had it a few days, but have been able to use it quite a bit. The WiFi on it seems to be really good, as I've used it all over the house, including the garage and outside in the background, to play I Heart Radio and Prime Music. Not once did playback get interrupted. The sound quality definitely isn't Bose, but it isn't a cheap brand either. I'd give the sound quality a 7 out of 10 stars. Audiophiles probably wouldn't like it though - just saying.    At present, the only complaint I have is that the metal charging circle on the bottom is always exposed. I'm not sure if that would cause any problems over time, but it just bothers me. So, I ordered a case for my Tap - problem solved. :) ",
"Mister Doctor","March 5, 2017 ",5.0,"I realize people read 5 star and 1 star reviews.    Pros: It's nice that I can listen to music at my command.    Cons:  In order to load up a bunch of songs, I must pay a yearly fee.    The shuffle doesn't work very well.  I have 10,000 songs to work with, but it seems to play the same ones a lot.  There are a whole bunch of people complaining about this, but Amazon does nothing about it.  Wrote a letter to their help line.  They give a nice response with absolutely no followup or effort to fix.  Instead, they work on giving you more commands, like 'watch Jimmy Fallon'. ",
"Michelle Touchstone","November 25, 2016 ",5.0,"I really loved the Tap when I got it, except that I could not do hands-free. Then in February Amazon announced that a free software update will allow this. So we waited on buying an Echo Dot. It is now April 14th and I have yet to have the software update occur. In mid-March after seeing most people had the update already I reached out to Customer Service, was told it must be defective, and a new device was sent to me. 3 weeks later from receiving the new one and guess what: no software update again either! Every time we try to follow up on a ticket created we're told to reset it. Do that and no update. It even says in 24 hours we will. Reset after 4 days again, no update. Then told it will take 24 to 48 hours to get results on our ticket. Here it is 2 weeks later and nothing new. Then they tried to tell me today it is an isolated incident and want to send me a new one yet again! Um, don't care to have to wait yet again. If you can't fix the issue and do a software update when a device is hooked to Wi-Fi all the time and it's Wi-Fi strong enough to update Fire Stick software all the time and stream with no issue, then why would I want a new one yet again?

"Guillermo Betancourt","March 31, 2017 ",2.0,"Update 7APR17 - About a review - Amazon Tab  Amazon Tab is the best portable Bluetooth speaker ever made. I just have to say that the sound quality is Excellent!! Works flawless with Spotify. Everything else that this device can do you can consider it as a free feature from Amazon considering the price tag of JUST $129.99 compared to $199 from other makers and you just get that, a speaker.    Read the features, is worth every penny. If is too much $ for you then wait for Amazon sales, I got one for just $69 during Prime Day.  Best Bluetooth speaker EVER -    I have no idea why engadget.com gave this product a bad review.  I think they were expecting a 1000 watts speaker on such tiny case. They also complaint about the not always on Alexa.  First of all, the speakers are just fine, they are really good. Second, how can you have an always on Alexa when the Tap is made to take it anywhere you want using its internal battery which by the way it last for a really long time. At least for me is working out really good and I take it almost every time I go out. ",
John,"April 14, 2017 ",3.0,"Whoa! Great sound! I've been using an Echo Dot as a desktop speaker but decided to upgrade to a bluetooth speaker. The Amazon Tap was the logical choice so I bought one. I am blown away by the sound coming out of such a small package. Standing at a height of 6&#34; and a diameter of bout 2.5&#34;, it sits unobtrusively on my desk. Yet it pours out such clear and balanced sound even at low volume. As with my Echo Dot, set up took only a couple of minutes using the Alexa app on my phone. Sweet! ",
"Eric Westrope","April 13, 2016 ",5.0,"I bought mine at Best Buy.  I had not actually intended to purchase one.  But after seeing it in person and then finding out what it could do.  I bought it.  And I love it.  I am very happy with all the features and the sound is awesome. I have been using it outside when working on landscaping my yard.  I found that just by putting the Tap in a draw string closed cloth sack. You can keep it from getting dirty. And can still hear the music clearly.  On the whole,  of you love to listen to great sounding audio while on the move or working in the yard, garage, greenhouse or any other place. This small device of prefect. Internet news,  music,  talk shows are all there for you.  Plus all your Amazon audio content as well. ",
Joanne,"December 28, 2016 ",5.0,"This is my first Alexa product and I'm really enjoying it!  I had no set up issues and got it up and running in just a few minutes.  Alexa understands everything I say and I've been having fun moving the tap from room to room and using it to play music, check weather, sports and traffic, and to set timers while baking.  My parents and I also got a kick out of asking her &#34;silly&#34; questions like &#34;What's your name?&#34; &#34;How are you?&#34; and &#34;What do you think of Amazon?&#34;  (She actually has no opinion on that!)    Basically it's a fun and useful gadget that I think will both entertain (playing music at parties, telling jokes, etc.) and be useful (setting timers, checking traffic and weather).  The device itself is light, but sturdy and I think it will hold up well.  I also like that instead of guessing when it's time to charge it, you can just ask Alexa how her battery is and she'll tell you.    Great product! ",
