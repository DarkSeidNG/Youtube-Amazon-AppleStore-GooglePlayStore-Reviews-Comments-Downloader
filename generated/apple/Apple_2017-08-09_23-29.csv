Achart,-,5,"Food is generally good",
eakenzua58,-,1,"I've tried with multiple credit cards, different accounts, and countless other solutions but the app refuses to let me order. Idk why the few restaurants that use them continue since I have to turn to more reliable alternatives like DoorDash or postmates to get food",

"Gaiman Fan",-,1,"Don't update to the latest! It forgets everything... where you live, your favorite restaurants! The new UI is truly awful. Confusing and seemingly never tested. A total waste of time.",
SoCalCyn,-,1,"Worst ordering process. Finally just gave up.",
Ediddy6,-,5,"The actual service is awesome obviously but there was an issue with a restaurant I frequently order from and a customer rep fixed the issue and gave me a coupon code.",
Haydizzle534,-,5,"Great idea! Love that you guys are in suburb areas now. Not just major cities! You will definitely get lots of orders and tips from this household! Thanks for expanding!",
Xooxa,-,4,"Since I've been ill, this app has been a dream come true!  Drivers are awesome!  Gave 3 stars because there needs to be more restaurant variety.",

"üçß Jolene üçß",-,5,"Grubhub is the only food app that's available in my area and it's absolutely amazing. Great restaurants and customer service!",
"Truly Vee",-,1,"The driver carried my food In his car for 37 minutes while making other deliveries. The food wasn't kept in any type of heat containing bag. Very disappointed. Probably won't use again since there is no customer service link to resolve issues such as these.",

craziiswimmer,-,5,"Title speaks for itself",
Stinesong,-,5,"So far I've used Grubhub 3 times and every time the food has been correct, hot, and delivered earlier than estimated.",
ashbuhbee,-,5,"Love it",
DietcokeheadSD,-,5,"I've used this app A LOT this summer. It's been ridiculously hot so I don't want to cook. This is a better alternative to cereal for dinner!",
Pattay090,-,4,"If I use GH for local restaurants within a mile of my house, I get exactly what I order & the food is consistently good & on time.   But whoever we try a newer place located farther away, it's hit or miss.  I will say that GH's refund policy is absolutely spot on & customer service is friendly & spot on.  Thanks GH!!! üòé",
woonbae,-,5,"faster and less problems with overall ordering",
"Mr ARM",-,1,"Used to be great now I have to uninstall and install every single time. Screw you guys for breaking what worked.",
JoeSantos90,-,4,"It's really nothing special about this app but works well.",
Dlkmama,-,5,"Love the incorporation of Apple Pay and the convenience. The running total at the bottom is helpful as well. Only problem has been restraints not ""noticing"" the order is there. If I don't get an email acknowledgement from the restaurant I have to call which defeats the purpose of on line ordering. The app is great. Restraints need to develop a better way of recognizing orders when they come in.",
Shark1422,-,5,"App is easy to use and hardly ever bugs out.  Love it!",
EllieLove1292,-,5,"This app is so convenient, and I've found that I'm more likely to try different foods in the area if I don't even have to leave my house to go to different restaurants.   Awesome app.",
"Anonymous teen üôÇ",-,5,"I really love this app and when a transaction is cancelled on the restaurants behalf grub hub personnel personally calls you and let's you know that you are gonna get a complete refund Grub hub has great service very recommended by me #GOGRUBHUB!",
Jimkoon1954,-,5,"This is by far the best food order and delivery service in Morgantown, WV. Reliable, fast, friendly service willing to go out of their way to correct mistakes and do things right. Bravo Grubhub! You are number 1 in my book!",
"Straw to my berry",-,5,"Love it very convenient!",
TomTom1798,-,3,"Service is getting better, I ordered Waffels one morning and paid over $27 from this big end place. I ordered at 9:30 am and received my order around 11:45am on a Saturday morning. Then The waffles came weltered like they were frozen and sent To the microwave. They were so rubbery. Grub Hub cust service refunded my money and gave me a $10 coupon. But I think Grub needs to kick restaurants off with low scores.  1st review  I ordered breakfast this morning before 11am, the food didn't show until after 2pm. I had to call grub hub, the restaurant so many times just to get my order.  I get a simple $10 coupon code. I go to use the coupon code that night and got no food or. Reply. I called grub hub, they cancelled the order and gave me another coupon. I don't want coupons I just want my food correct. I never seem to have these problems when using Yelp Eat24.",
a-raines21,-,5,"Which they had more restaurants but its a great app all around. Customer service is on point, and any bad experience I have had was with the restaurant, not Grubhub. 5 stars",
Tachi_sherry,-,4,"It's a very good app with featured restaurants. The reason I didn't give five stars is because I wish the app follows up the customers after they receive the orders. Like the app F, they care more if the customers are giving low rated reviews after their orders. People complain about an order to hope the app would do something about it. If the app could help more, that would make it a better ordering app rather than just a yelp.",
SoCalBee73,-,5,"We've use Grub Hub several times now and all great experiences. Delivery within the hour, the food is always well packed, and one driver even carried thermal bags which was nice. Highly recommend the app and the service.",
TJunior1014,-,5,"I ordered from a place that is currently ""offline"" but GrubHub called immediately and refunded my order. Great customer service.",
"N. CHL",-,5,"I use GrubHub all over the country as I travel for work and it is a must have app for a frequent flyer. Service is quality and I never have strange activity on my card or bad customer service experiences. The app is easy to use and they keep me fed wherever I am!",
lizzythomasss,-,1,"Barely works",
RedJenny121517,-,5,"The best invention. Long live food delivery in the suburbs!",
TheUnimind,-,5,"A lifesaver in trying to get something to eat!",
itzmiijezuz,-,5,"Have ordered over 4 times and it was all good and on time üòä",
#DreaFromPhilly,-,4,"Convenient way of finding local places to eat especially if your like me and rarely have cash or feel comfortable giving your card info over the phone.  It gives updates letting you know when to expect your order and that it's being worked on.  Yes, I've had problems where a restaurant messed up my order but that doesn't have anything to due with the app. I just made a mental note not to order from there anymore. Would definitely recommend this app to anyone that's looking for a safe way to order food. And it allows you to tip!!! No cash needed.  :)",
harpademic,-,5,"We use the GrubHub app at least 2-3 times each week. It works perfectly!",
"Carla Jeanius",-,1,"Repeated errors with prices of menu items.  Example: price is $5, but rings up as $10.",
