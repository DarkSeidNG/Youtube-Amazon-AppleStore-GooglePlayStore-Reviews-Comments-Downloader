Pattay090,-,4,"If I use GH for local restaurants within a mile of my house, I get exactly what I order & the food is consistently good & on time.   But whoever we try a newer place located farther away, it's hit or miss.  I will say that GH's refund policy is absolutely spot on & customer service is friendly & spot on.  Thanks GH!!! üòé",

JoeSantos90,-,4,"It's really nothing special about this app but works well.",
Dlkmama,-,5,"Love the incorporation of Apple Pay and the convenience. The running total at the bottom is helpful as well. Only problem has been restraints not ""noticing"" the order is there. If I don't get an email acknowledgement from the restaurant I have to call which defeats the purpose of on line ordering. The app is great. Restraints need to develop a better way of recognizing orders when they come in.",

TomTom1798,-,3,"Service is getting better, I ordered Waffels one morning and paid over $27 from this big end place. I ordered at 9:30 am and received my order around 11:45am on a Saturday morning. Then The waffles came weltered like they were frozen and sent To the microwave. They were so rubbery. Grub Hub cust service refunded my money and gave me a $10 coupon. But I think Grub needs to kick restaurants off with low scores.  1st review  I ordered breakfast this morning before 11am, the food didn't show until after 2pm. I had to call grub hub, the restaurant so many times just to get my order.  I get a simple $10 coupon code. I go to use the coupon code that night and got no food or. Reply. I called grub hub, they cancelled the order and gave me another coupon. I don't want coupons I just want my food correct. I never seem to have these problems when using Yelp Eat24.",
a-raines21,-,5,"Which they had more restaurants but its a great app all around. Customer service is on point, and any bad experience I have had was with the restaurant, not Grubhub. 5 stars",
Tachi_sherry,-,4,"It's a very good app with featured restaurants. The reason I didn't give five stars is because I wish the app follows up the customers after they receive the orders. Like the app F, they care more if the customers are giving low rated reviews after their orders. People complain about an order to hope the app would do something about it. If the app could help more, that would make it a better ordering app rather than just a yelp.",
SoCalBee73,-,5,"We've use Grub Hub several times now and all great experiences. Delivery within the hour, the food is always well packed, and one driver even carried thermal bags which was nice. Highly recommend the app and the service.",

#DreaFromPhilly,-,4,"Convenient way of finding local places to eat especially if your like me and rarely have cash or feel comfortable giving your card info over the phone.  It gives updates letting you know when to expect your order and that it's being worked on.  Yes, I've had problems where a restaurant messed up my order but that doesn't have anything to due with the app. I just made a mental note not to order from there anymore. Would definitely recommend this app to anyone that's looking for a safe way to order food. And it allows you to tip!!! No cash needed.  :)",

Ssgabriele,-,1,"This is the absolute last time I will use this app. If the delivery time is quoted for 45 min, you need to tack on 90 minutes. Either the restaurants on the app cannot handle the delivery or there is some issue in the processing. Ive used this app four times over the past three years and every time with the same result--over two hour delivery time when 45 min is quoted. Awful! Im deleting the app immediately!",

Karefree46,-,5,"Great way to get food when I'm too lazy to cook. I love the reorder feature!",
CometWaves,-,1,"Many restaurants deliver directly to my address without a problem. The few orders that use GrubHub delivery staff is entirely hit and miss. My wife and I have had numerous orders filled then delivered to someone else. Frustrating since we wait an hour or more after the delivery times and then find out we can only get a refund, then have to order again or from another restaurant. Occasionally we can't reorder as the restaurant has since closed for the evening. GrubHub doesn't verify they are at the correct address. One of my neighbors must be eating well as they keep accepting our orders. I am very disappointed. No reimbursement for my time, and certainly nothing to compensate for hunger.",
0laf,-,2,"You can probably read the good and bad reviews, and see that sometimes it's good and sometimes bad. The real shame is the customer service. The bad would be no problem if it wasn't for the atrocious customer service. You'll see",

Gunnymoney,-,5,Flawless.,
TiffandPinot,-,1,"I used this app for the first time because I received a coupon in the mail. My order came and it was wrong, i threw it away... thanks it was the restaurants fault. I called customer service who informed me they would give me a refund. My original cost was $25 minus $10 coupon so I paid $14. I receive an email giving me a $6 refund. Not even my full refund!   When I called customer service he said there was nothing he could do and that the person who refunded me did it wrong and could get in trouble. So I asked to speak to a manager who they said was unavailable. They said they would try to have someone call me within two days.   Fightin the charge with my cc now. Never using Grubhub again. Customer support is lacking.",
karan301,-,4,"This is maybe the only Apple TV app I use. It's great on iOS because it has Apple Pay support. It's so close to being perfect; I just need it to support native iOS size classes (i.e. Optimize for the iPad Pro 10.5 and 12.9, and add Multitasking support). I'd sing so much praise of it then.   I'd also like the iMessage app to be more useful (group ordering maybe?) but that's a stretch goal. I really just care about the iPad stuff and would give it five stars instantly for that.",

First night I downloaded this trash app it took 2 hours to find out they cancelled my order since they had no drivers. Restaurant closed and had to get McDonald's....for the sake of time do not use this app that's run by monkeys. Choose uber eats or you're even better off walking 10 miles to get your food instead of ordering with these clowns. #uninstalled",

MissJennL,-,4,"I'm honestly too lazy to many more occasions than I care to admit to actually get up and go out to eat. GrubHub makes it possible for me to stay home, enjoy, and be able to just relax. They may not always be on time but they are always nice and friendly. Plus when they're driving around to bring food to lazy folks like me you really can't complain. And the way I look at it‚Ä¶ Good things come to those who wait. GrubHub always brings me good things!",
Swimsnycs1313,-,1,"It's a fine app but the actual deliveries are a mess. Not once has it been the same time frame as what is quoted on the app. Frequently missing items. Customer service is slow and pretty much useless. Post mates is some how always faster. Weird. Also food has come cold frequently. Don't waste your time on this one. üëçüèº",
itsMax!,-,1,"I wanted to use this app and just try it out. I waited the usual time for a delivery like this. But when I got the ring, it was because the driver didn't know where I was at. Honest mistake, it's okay, easy fix. I told him directions, but he was very frustrated for some reason. I was calmly telling him, where I was at, was not close to where he is delivering too. I then sent him a link of my address so he could see what it looked like. He contacts me many more times saying he can't find my address. At this point I am a bit agitated, as I am giving him directions that are clear as day.  So 30 more minutes pass by and he calls me to tell me to meet up with him.. I don't think I was furious, but this whole mishap completely messed up my evening.. As I was doing a timed test for my class.. I would not ever recommend this app.",

"Shadow 021498",-,1,"Here's what's BS. If you put in your order with a discount code, then come back moments later to place the order....the coupon code is gone. They constantly delete your 10% or 15% off coupon. It doesn't hold in the code entry box.........So! If you change your mind on your order...you've also changed your mind on using your coupon code. If you don't RE-enter your coupon code (after changing your mind on your order) your coupon code is gone. In the words of Patrick Warburton, ""that's how they get yuh"".",
graybobreview,-,1,"Bad experience with grubhub. Never received my $7 first time discount.  Also restaurant had lower price in the store than going thru grubhub. Feel cheated and violated by grubhub. Called and sent grubhub pictures and receipts to prove it. They said we will look into it.  Waiting one week for update they said no discrepancies were found- inspire of me having all proofs.  This was outright daylight robbery. Restaurants don't want to pay 50% royalty to grubhub so they increase price thru grubhub. When I went literally  to three different restaurants found lower prices in stores. All our orders were pick up so no surcharges were to be added either. Literally price difference was $1 higher per item ordered.  What's the point to order thru grubhub?? Just Call restaurants directly and get lower prices.  We will rather use Groupon and loving social to get lower prices/ deals.  Customer service is very poor too. Chatted online were told to call. When we Called were told to email. No management chain or leaderships skills with grubhub.  App is being deleted.",

"Kaka dada",-,1,"Tried the app for the first time hoping to get $7 off first order. Never received the email nor the code. Second of all restaurants literally have two sets of prices. One is for online order -separate menu and another for walk in traffic.  I literally compared three restaurants and difference was $1 more on each item ordered. Total rip off. Called so called customer service and was told we will look in to. Literally all orders were pick up. So shouldn't have been extra surcharges for placing order online. Feel cheated.  Also when I called for first time order discount was told to chat in. When I chatted for 20 mins was told to call. When I called was told to email grub hub. Total wackos and company run by kids.

"Fergus the Frankfurter",-,5,"Molto benne",
Jablonskinator,-,3,"TL;DR: Check the menu, call the restaurant!!!  Been a huge grub hub-er for 6 years now.   They charge fees that calling the restaurant wouldn't charge. They have more of the menu than most local restaurants keep up on (Albany NY)  They have a decent amount of fees for the consumer, and they charge the restaurant for their service.   Had fraud 5x within a month, they weren't great about cancelling charges. One CS rep did it, had to call my CC to cancel 3 of the 5.   Use this app, but don't order from them. They don't deserve the (money from the restaurant)",

The technical support team was extremely rude and unhelpful telling me just use another device because they had no training on how to fix this.  After I tried to further explain the problem to them they stopped responding to my emails all together.  Everyone I have talked to seems to pass me on to someone else who they say will contact me within 72hrs but never do.  Will definitely be using doordash or delivery.com from now on since Grubhub doesn't care to help their loyal customers.",

CRWilky,-,1,"So today my girlfriend ordered me a delivery while I was at work, so that it would arrive on my lunch. On the jobsite that I work at my service is kind of iffy, so my girl wrote the a note to use my coworkers phone number when they arrive, so that they could reach us. I received a text saying that my lunch would arrive at 12. Then I received a new one at like 30 minutes later saying it would be there at 11:20. My lunch doesn't start until 12. I NEVER received a call and neither did my coworker. I called customer service and they said they couldn't give me a refund because it was ""my fault"" they missed my delivery. I spoke to a supervisor who kept insinuating that it was my fault and they can't refund me because of that. She offered me a coupon. I told her I wouldn't be doing business with them so I want my money. She basically said she couldn't help me. I was pretty upset as you can see, so I called back again and asked to speak to another supverisor, and explained my situation. The lady I spoke to looked up and saw that there was no record of the driver calling ANY of the provided numbers. She said that all they did was send me an email, so basically the supervisor I spoke to lied and just didn't want me to get my refund. Who checks their emails that frequently that makes it an efficient way of contacting someone for a delivery, which apparently is time sensitive? Also, the supervisor told me they were sending the driver back out with my food and they would be there in 7 minutes. She quoted exactly 7 minutes. They never showed up, never called, or anything. My girlfriend got an email, not a call, an hour later saying they were trying to deliver my food. This company must be training liars and thieves. I am thankful for the last person I spoke to helping me out and making sure I was satisfied. I'm going to spread the word to everyone I know, an make sure they don't support this screwed up company.",

After not arriving within that time I check status again and it is pushing it back to after 10pm. I call to make sure they picked up my order before they closed. The customer service was kind enough to check and contacted the driver who said he had not yet picked up the food. Then called the restaurant to make sure they were still there and they said they were. I told the customer service that I was disappointed and she suggested that I could talk with a supervisor.   HERE IS WHERE THINGS WENT REALLY WRONG. She was unconcerned and unapologetic. Instead of her taking control of the situation she kept asking with an annoyed tone ""what would you like me to do? ""   I asked her what explanation she has for this pure customer service and she never answered and never apologized for the inconvenience.

The only reason I'm not giving this app 5 stars is because the delivery fees are inconsistent. One can be $2.99 while another can be $5.99.  When you're just ordering for one person it can become quite costly. Another reason is I ordered from a Korean restaurant and paid a $5.99 delivery fee but instead of a Grubhub deliverer, A person from the restaurant showed up. This place normally offers free delivery but because I place the order on the Grubhub app I still had to pay the $5.99 fee.  All-in-all, this is a great alternative to your usual takeout places.

The good news is when your food shows up over 1 hour LATE, they will tell you that you don't have to pay for it. However their idea of not paying for it is grub hub coupons that you have to spread over multiple new orders and also have your food show up and hour late.

For example I saw one of my favorite restaurants on there but when I clicked it it said they weren't on grubhub. What? Why have that on the list then?  Another issue is the goddamn bugs, every time I want to place an order there is some obscure bug that means I have to restart the app. (Alright maybe not EVERY time but enough that it annoys the F*** out of me.) That wouldn't even be an issue if there was a contingency in the code that saves my order, but there exists no such contingency. Everything is deleted and I have to restart. They layout of the app is my final annoyance, there doesn't seem to be any sort of format that they follow except just compiling all the restaurants in one incredibly long list. I mean they should be trying to expand the horizons of people who use there app, to try and enhance the experience of ordering food. Map out what people order and figure out new places that fit their budget/presences. We live in an age where a company this large would have no issue doing such things yet they don't. All the app does now is cut out the phone call.  Maybe I'm completely off base, but for a company that turns over almost 3 BILLION dollars worth of food orders a year, they should be a little more intuitive, and for a company that has existed for 13 years maybe they would have a better sense of how to improve.",
