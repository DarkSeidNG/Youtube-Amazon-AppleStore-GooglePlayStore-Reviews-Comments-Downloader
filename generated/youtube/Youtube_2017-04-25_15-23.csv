All tech demos ever since the first xbox with the dancing girl and the robot  have been lies. Not a single time have we seen graphics as good as in tech demos  in games. And don't tell me PCs would not be able to run it with graphics like these. They made Unreal Engine 90% for gaming. Which means what we see in tech demos are actually games running in real time. This one AND the Luminous engine tech demo. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Remember the Luminous engine demo? The first time i saw it  i immediately said there's no way we're gonna see graphics like this in-game. And BINGO. Final Fantasy XV uses the Luminous Engine and the graphics look NOTHING like the tech demo. Don't feed us lies and false hopes.
