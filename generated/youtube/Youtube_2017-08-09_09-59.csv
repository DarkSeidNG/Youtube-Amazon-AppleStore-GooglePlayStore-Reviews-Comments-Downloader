Factors such as racial bias, discrimination, lack of fair and equal opportunity and chance on work, education, health care, housing and lack of fair treatment by the judicial systems in the society shapes our personalities and  as a result our tendency to violence, disobedience to the law increases especial among young people. I know many people who have struggled most of their life, but unable to break through racial barriers to reach their dreams. But few can make it through one or two telephone calls.

"Mike Desi","August 07, 2017",,"For every success story there are countless others who tried what they did to a tee, and ultimately failed repeatedly until death. Not only do you have to be determined, but intelligent and lucky as well. And for the love of God go to bed and wake up early. Otherwise you will not live as long and be able to think as well. Don't just work and work, that is what the people stuck in factories do. If you want to be  successful, take houra a week just to ponder and then work both smart and hard. Be assertive and take steps, not risks. You *can* push yourself, but know what that means. Only take risks of you have to. Always have a backup plan and never feel disheartened. It is life, work with it. Crying won't get you anywhere.    As a side note it also helps to consume sustainable energy such as whole grains. It is the difference between throwing straw in a fire, or tossing in a log. Don't take my word on nutrition, find credible trials that are not funded by Cheetos or Pepsi corporation (as these just so happen to show that sugar is absolutely fine and doesn't metabolize in 20 minutes spiking your blood sugar, slowly wearing out the pancreus, making you more hungry and decreasing energy levels. And the researchers for one all resigned due to them being forced to essentially manufacture results dispite what they had found.) and do the research yourself. In a nutshell, be smart about it, plan ahead and keep yourself in good health so that you may continue to do that.     (Still enjoy life along the way.)",

I'm so sick of lazy individuals complaining about everything not being perfect, they have not grown up yet. They have not realized what the world truly is and they only see their own negative lens. This DOES not mean you will not fail, it does not mean you will never get hurt. THE POINT IS THAT NO MATTER WHAT IS THROWN AT YOU, IF YOU GIVE UP YOU WILL NEVER SUCCEED.

"Linas Ivanauskas","August 05, 2017",,"This video can indeed motivate, but if you understand that in order to reach your success you need to light your own way when there is darkness, that you need to build/find your own road when the road that you were walking on ends,  that if you want to rest on your journey but there is no were to sit you need to build your own bench, and finally once you do not want to go down the road any more and there is no were to stay you need to build a place were you can stay at, till you decide to continue the journey of life or end it, It is really cheap, but entertaining.  In conclusion just do everything your self and if you fale keep trying, if you fale again remove the reason that made you fale and try again.",

"Stella Johnson","August 05, 2017",,"If you work hard enough, you can replace depression with exhaustion. There is a reason why they teach us to ""work hard"" or ""get an education"" and when you look into it... all the rich, successful ones are school drop outs, they didn't bloody finish school. I'll be damned, I thought, how is this even possible? I worked my a** off all my life just like the majority of us, yet we ain't the ones who got to stand on stage to teach. We are the bloody 'losers' who are listening to these lectures. My god, what an epiphany I had. So here is the deal: if you have to MAKE effort, you are not on the right path. The right path is yours. Gently calling you, gently guiding you.. it's more like an EASE, rather than struggle or hustle. You'll feel a sense of RELIEF. Those are the words, feelings that we need to look for in life. You can not miss your own boat. It's yours. It's docked 'till you are ready for your OWN success. The only boat we can miss is someone else's. We all have a special platform, a ""God's Given Talent"" that no degree can give you. It's more often a smaller version of these big, famous motivators, so it won't be a stage or a TV show or an Olympic medal, you/we most likely will never be famous..... but it is ours. Our little flame is still living in us, calling us to follow (that silent voice from within), that's the Universe's voice, Source Energy that we are the extension of, that some call God. Not the Ego's harsh voice that is telling us that we aren't pretty enough of rich enough or push harder, but that silent realm that softly whispers, gently awaits to be heard. It's more like a pull rather than a push..... so just answer The Call. xxxx",

Because uniqueness isn't cost effective to produce.   Videos such as these that are meant to pit you against the rest of the world are only meant to dangle a carrot in front of you. The hope point is that you never get to have that carrot, cause else you won't have the need to consume more motivational content. They make you feel there is something lacking in your life, that feeling turns into a disease and more often than not you end up being addicted to this ""motivational"" drug. (But don't believe this, do you own research - like reading actual research papers not some stupid random content on the web)   Don't let life be a carrot that's perpetually dangling out of your reach.

In buddhist dharma, life contains suffering; all suffering is the result of desire; the suffering in life can be eliminated/conquered; the method is to control your wants and not be a slave to them.   An ancient Indian saying  states that he who has conquered his mind has conquered the universe.  None of the motivational slogans in the video are a path to joy, contentment or bliss.  The video is a classic example of a sales pitch to ""buy this and you will be happy"".  Its basically a weight loss video.  Lose 10 pounds and you will be happy.  All bull.

Only use competition as a last resort, or where there's no other way to proceed. Yes, build your dreams from your heart, and become truly excellent in what you love.  I'm not talking from the school of thought that says you have to give a trophy to every kid no matter how well they did - that's NOT what I'm talking about.  You should always have to work for the skills you want - society shouldn't have to pretend you're good at or even able to do a job or activity that you clearly aren't cut out for.

My personal belief is that we will NEVER solve the majority of human problems if we ALWAYS look at each other as competition.  In many cases, the 1,000 people with the same dream can easily help each other so that they ALL succeed.  A quick example is one I've run into over and over in my life - there's plenty of business out there for there to be several sole proprietor small businesses growing and selling cut flowers and still leave plenty of business for the big chains to make tons of money.  But the big chain stores and services HATE the idea of competition (this is not paranoia, or reading the wrong web-sites - this is direct experience in my life). It sounds childishly simplistic, and an impossible dream - but THIS IS MY DREAM - that we finally learn that every single one of us is better off if we focus on co-operation instead of competition.  NOT eliminate competition, but use it as a tool only where it will truly be necessary and/or truly helpful to the majority.",

When the sun rises you will push yourself....not for a reward or recognition, but to sustain that feeling inside. To know this feeling is to never work nor sacrifice ever again, but you will push harder than you ever have. It will not be rational nor logical because love is not bound by such laws.

You're not more important or ranked higher or more famous than anyone else on this planet. You're not. Thinking you are better than others because you make money or sing or play sports or whatever else is mental illness. Money, status, all that stuff, is in your head. TIME is what is important. TIME! If you slave away working 100 hours a week to HUSTLE, you are wasting your life. Guess what happens when you reach your goal? You lose your sense of self. You either make a new goal, or you become aimless and empty. How can you be proud of yourself when you have nobody to share it with bc you spent all your energy on the hustle? All the hustling you did will just remind you of how you suffered to achieve a goal that meant nothing later on. Keep the people that you LOVE close. Make time for them. Live for experience and memories. If you are lonely, success will be empty anyway. Enjoy your time here.....   It's all you have. This video is trying to brainwash you.

You are more likely to get infections, headaches, vision issues, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and be flat out less productive. The list goes on and on. A brain working on 6 hours of sleep is a fourth as productive as a brain with 8 hours of sleep. If you are an athlete (as this video seems to be aimed at) you MUST sleep in order to recover properly and perform even comparably to your best. So let's rethink the idea that you must wake up the earliest and go to bed last. What is more important is being productive during your waking hours and prioritizing your time. There are only 24 hours in a day and something has to give. That's just the game of life.",
"Handsome Leper","August 03, 2017",,"I'm almost inspired to make the counter video, but IRONICALLY my point (to come) dictates that I don't.  Look, all this advice is inspirational and has its merits, but unfortunately it's all wrong, and I mean ALL of it. Success does not predicate happiness. Quite the opposite in fact. The most successful people on earth, by and large, rank the lowest in happiness, highest in drug/alcohol abuse, have horrible relationships with their friends/family, and it just goes on.  Grit, determination, and endurance sell posters, but what do they get you? A job? A partner? Things? I could argue all of this, but I'm going to cut to the chase...  Do nothing, want nothing, exist to merely survive, AND be grateful for EVERYTHING that comes your way. Keep a job that keeps you fed, a roof over your head, and sandals in your feet. Just exist. Unclutter, deconstruct, and be LESS. Make a small splash, leave a tiny footprint, and just spend YOUR TIME taking it all in, and be thankful for the smallest of blessings.  I don't envy the sports star who dedicates their whole life towards the game...I envy the person who dedicates their life to taking it easy.  Forget about fame, glory, notoriety, money, consumerism, status, etc...and just focus on being simple.

LOL best parent at 86? No.  Its not that you put your heart into something and fail that you'll feel bad. That's purely fictional. ITs not about feelings, its about investing into something that will lead you to be homeless or financially worse off. But there may be some people who dont care about that. And if that's true then emotion shouldn't be even remotely a problem. Being homeless is far worse than feeling hurt because you failed at something.  Its far better to be afraid of being poor.  We are all great? No. We aren't. Greatness doesn't pay the bills at the end of the day. But to achieve your goals, yes, you do have to shut out the world.   Meant for more? So were all meant to be pro atheletes? Meant for something? Help the world? I thought only i defined what im meant for? Were all supposed to be self help gurus now? Everyone has their own ideas asto what makes the ideal person. In reality the best person is the most realistic one. Not the ideal one. When it comes down the what the world should be, the only question you have to ask yourself is what kind of world do you want to live in.   Want to fight for something better? Stop voting for idiots.

And there isn't enough room for everyone to do what they want. ITs all the things that people dont want to do that has to be done. Can some people do this? Yes. But not everyone. To some degree people have to just look at their lives and either accept it or fight for something better. But motivation's not going to necessarily get you anywhere.

God always gives back more than you could ever expect, and then some.  Without GOD you can do nothing in your own strength.. your efforts will fall flat, and FAIL without God coaching you, guiding you, showing you.. Your recognition and partnering with him, is key.

There's truth in this video, sure.. but where they steer you wrong is telling you you have to strive and do it all in your own strength.. that's a lie.  That will burn you out, and KILL your dreams and desires.    Yeah, we all have to hustle.. nothing is free.. even GOD says Faith without works is dead.. But if you put GOD first, he will blow your mind with his love and goodness in your life, the wisdom he'll give you, the decisions you make, and great ideas you never could of thought of for yourself... Partnering and knowing Him is the real deal.. you don't have to kill yourself to be someone or get somewhere in life..

"Conor McCammon","July 31, 2017",,"This video was straight up banal. I'm not trying to be negative when I say this, but stuff like this feels like empty emotional calories. Whoever made this slapped together some soaring music, footage of someone in the rain and a voiceover that seems to say some profound shit about purpose and success. Ta-da. Ten minutes of mild, unhelpful motivation. Nothing about it spoke to me. The quotes were all vague and pretty much meaningless, or the same old shit about ""you gotta hustle HARDER, fight LONGER, blahblahBLAH"" shouted at you. Am I the only one who feels like these videos are so self-absorbed they have their head up their asses? I was depressed for a long time. Motivation isn't what you need. Especially not second-rate, empty-calorie motivation. I suspect these videos serve only to make people more unhappy. First, it gives you this big catharsis like you've just DONE all the things the video shouts at you, you've run the marathon, you've trained at boxing, you've pushed a tire in the rain. So at the end, the motivation just drops away. You were living vicariously through someone else's hustle. Secondly, all the advice they give is not only going to make you unhappy, it's just bad advice for changing people's lives. Unhappy because the message is basically ""are you suffering? Well then you need to work so hard and long that you end up better than everyone else on Earth, or you'll be stuck there."" And bad advice because anyone who is looking to a motivational video for support and inspiration isn't going to revolutionise their life through hustling harder than everyone else. Where do they mention being happy? Isn't that why people think they have to be the best in the first place? Because when they get to their destination finally they'll be content? And since when has ANYONE (barring those with near-death experiences) done a huge turnaround in all their behaviors and actions in life? If you want to know how to change your life, listen to someone like Jordan Peterson. You'll realise that negotiating with yourself and deciding on incremental growth is way more successful and sustainable than this ""hustle hard and be miserable"" attitude. And if you're obsessing over this motivation thing, listen to some Alan Watts. Because there's nothing but empty calories to be found in this ""motivational"" genre.  Rant over üòÇ mamma mia",

The problem with most of these ""motivational"" videos is that they're all about competition with others...being the best athlete, or the richest CEO...there's nothing wrong with that except that many young people (inexperienced) believe that ""once they achieve this or that"" THEN they'll be HAPPY.    True happiness and ""success"" doesn't come from competing with others ‚Äî it's within you.  We live in a world that has brainwashed us from the beginning to think that ""once I have this amount of money, or material things, or fame"" THEN I'LL BE HAPPY.  WRONG.  It's an illusion.  You'll always be trying to fill the void no matter how much you OWN or how many others you BEAT.  That is a mentality, a paradigm, that will always leave you feeling empty once you achieve your goal.  Competition and achieving goals can be positive and healthy if looked at from the right perspective.

"Big Red","July 30, 2017",,"This perception of success is all well and good, with the dog-eat-dog strategy as the foundation. But the amount of competitivness required within yourself, but ultimately with other people means that it becomes like a pyramid/ponsy scheme for individual success, not the success of all that are born. This sounds very much like the teachings of Werner Earnhardt, which l feel involves a personal development process that is a little self absorbed, and just feeling good about who you are until your inevitable death. There in lies a conundrum, because in being self focussed we rarely then evaluate the effect we have on others or the world around us. Think for a moment, would their be problem if we didn't live in a society of self centred greedy people only interested in their own success. I have another idea, why not enter an agreement with a significant other, and emplore them to make you valued if you need to feel valued? Googan was looking for acceptance from others, but it makes me wonder, whether he should have simply been looking for self acceptance of who he was, not within the descriptors set by others, but those set by himself. To get to where he was at that age he had already been successful, as he had health and he was alive. Therefore, to do your best and have an improvement mindset, rather than a vanquished attitude on one hand and a conquer the world attitude attitude on the other, is unhelpful if it is because you feel unloved or that no one likes me, or l can't accept the fact that l am insignificant. We all feel unloved, this leads to nascism  and that is a bigger issue than feeling insignificant. Be happy with insignificance (which many psychopaths aren't) and except your imminent death. That is a good starting point, and progress to leaving a small historical and social footprint on the world after you have gone.",

Rosario","July 29, 2017",,"There is something amiss here, for sure; when we overthink to the point of thought paralysis, sanity should then lead us to welcome a sounder realization: that we are but mere mortals, that there must be a better way. Can we all agree on this one, logical conclusion?  We are all limited by human capacity levels; and although some of us in our admirable youths can surpass certain production plateaus, we will inevitably see the day when our youthful vigor fails. It shall no longer be within ourselves to effect due change, or to bring into reality our own plan, however bold or calculated or ""genius"" it may be.  What then, does it profit a man to be a genius, depending solely on the building blocks of logic and reasoning and self-reliance? Nay, I say; let us admit defeat, when it so blatantly knocks indiscreetly at our doors!  Thank goodness for divine design: that by it, we may see our own limited potentials, to confess our own individual capacities, in order to embrace another factor: the vitality of faith. That by such divine design, procreation is made possible through the spreading of a man's seed and the breath of life coming exclusively from the Creator. For even a tree gives way to another and to another; the tree though it has no spirit, does not remain a single entity. And so, human collaboration through coexistence and needful interaction gives way to an assured, continued legacy. May that legacy be an enlightened one that acknowledges Christ the Creator of mankind, who is the dispenser of all good gifts, among which is the breath of life which effects new life, and the blessing of the knowledge of his redemption and its eventual prize: our life's continuity in paradise! And that, my friends, is food for thought.  I wish someone had told me THIS when I was younger: how obedience to God is the real key to one's lasting fulfillment, and how when we are apart from his divine will...we err, and thereby produce the reaping of an unintended harvest...DEATH, and exclusion from God. How long are the days then, as one waits patiently for the reaping of the intended harvest...LIFE and communion with God, with Christ at the center of one's temple. Once again, food for thought.",

Simply observe the examples of those whom are successful, those to who you would like to emulate. Nevertheless, reach within yourself and seek after your righteous desires, those dream's inwhich you would like to become.  Perhaps pondering and mediating may serve you well. However, make it your endeavor, your dream and strive toward it. Endure the trials and tribulations, for they will come and it will inherently be upon you to work through it. Dust off and go again, even if you have to change your perspective and pursue another dream.  I wish you well. I don't desire luck upon you, as I don't give credence to a fallacy.

Which ever idea you place your finger on before the timer goes off is the path you should put all your effort into.

If I studied and rightly-divided the Bible I would stand approved before God and it seemed that was a bigger priority.

Evil Lying Illegitimate Treacherous Enslaving Sociopaths  If you want to end the Federal Reserve and more importantly central banking, it is much easier in some ways than you may believe.  Have faith in yourself and do these two things.  Step 1:  Every day ask yourself this question as often as you would like:  How WILL I help end the Federal Reserve and central banking system?  How WILL I help end the Federal Reserve and central banking system?  How WILL I help end the Federal Reserve and central banking system?   2nd step:  Copy and paste this message anywhere and everywere that seems appropriate.   What they don't want you to know is that your subconscious mind is more powerful than any supercomputer, it WILL give you the answer.   They endoctrinate us and teach false histories, they pit us one against the other to drain our energy and will power, they distract us with ""entertainment"" or more like ""entrainment"". They poison our minds and supress our spirit. They use words like a form of magic against our minds and music, televsion frequencies set to lower our vibrational energy. They have us worship their centrally controlled debt notes called dollars.  The collective conscious taps into energy which transends their darkness.  Unity and FOCUS are their mortal enemy.

Go play soccer or something kid, this sport isn't for *you*. However, I remember my mom before she passed away telling me anything can happen, but will you make it happen? She said how she never would want me to be fat and hoped I could join the NFL. Sadly, she passed away last year. And that made me think, ""She didn't want me to be in this hole, so I'm getting out."" And I do to this day keep playing football and workout and everyday when I struggle to do something, I look at a picture of her and think to myself, ""Anything's can happen, but will you make it happen?"" Remember me when I join the NFL, because to me...there is no, ""Oh I *might* join the NFL."" To me I think I *WILL* join the NFL. Life only goes so long, everyday matters.

We need to change and restablish the righteous system. The underlying system organism has been abused long enough, the underlying system that has always saved us until now to register, organize, structurize, educate, participate, achieve goals and receive.

We will cure all diseases, and everybody will be able to get anything good they wish for. All evil that we now know today will be history and we will unite the world together under one banner. All that is criminal will never be allowed anymore. Our education system will be focused to give you all you need to be a great and valued participator of the world. We will all know our position within society and we will be recognized and praised for it. Nobody will feel lost only if you want it yourself. The criminal money and property system is gonna go one way or the other. As any kind of criminality will not be tolerated anylonger however it came to be or exist and whom ever supports or enforces this criminal system will be judged and punished. Time to end criminality in its whole! TIME TO GET REAL AND CHANGE FOR REAL!",

This one implies,  actually states explicitly, that you are wasting your time on Earth. if you don't identify and achieve  some tremendous feat of  creative, commercial, social or physical success, some grand and super special achievement that validates your life and makes You Special. We are special right? Isn't that what our parents taught us when they gave us all trophies even when we lost? Or cheered at every single game because it wasn't enough to just play because we enjoyed the game? This sort of message feeds the narcissism which will forever mark the millennials, and as someone from the parent side of that generation let me apologize for that. We have burdened you with the belief that it's no longer enough to go to school or learn a trade, raise a family or just support yourself and be a decent person. Nope, you have to achieve greatness, make a difference in the world, reach for the pinnacle of your dreams between 10 pm and 2 am - or else you are not really living. Seriously! The truth is none of us is really special and we are all special. Not everyone is going to have that sort of life and it's ok. It's absolutly worth getting up in the morning to simply do your best, get through school, go to college, learn a trade, beat depression, or cancer, or alcoholism, relax on the weekends with family and friends, lose a few pounds, play with your kids, learn to cook, be part of a community (not necessarily the leader)"", go to work (yep probably for someone else, sorry), learn more, grow mature, raise your kids, or love your hobbies, your dog, your family, give back, be humble, be kind, and reach your full potential whatever that may be,.....That is a life, it's worth living, and we used to understand that, we used to appreciate it, thank God for it. I love Morgan Freedman, but this rhetoric is hurting our realistic sense of well being, of wholeness, of enough-ness. We are passing though this world like krill through a whales mouth, directed more by instinct and flow than some grand dream....and it's OK. Everyone has a place and a role and we simply can't all be Michael Jordan or Steve Jobs. Let's get over ourselves and be grateful for the ride, enjoy it, cherish it, not waste it with feelings of inadequacy because we lack some  big grand dream that validates us, that clearly marks us as really really special, because we already are special. We are called to be the best and do the best we can with the gifts we have, enjoy life, love and be loved, and be grateful. Instead of searching for that Big dream, how about if we search honestly to figure out who we are, find peace with our imperfect lives, and not miss a single minute.",

What if you can't determine your goals? It's not actually hard to get something when you trully know what you wanna do, but it's hard and usually impossible when you are not 100% sure what you want.  I hade one clear goal, i wanted to lose weight and look good, i accomplished 90% of that and will be finishing that goal in next few months, but what with bigger things like your career, how to be sure 100 or at least 90% what you wanna do?",

Your brain ""is"" your computer and your computer does what you tell it to do.) I cannot tell you Everything or all the Secrets I have learned, but this small tip will help you succeed ""no doubt.""
