Maybe it'll help them find your drowned corpse.)  ""Micro Pyro"" -- a concealable hand-held or wrist mounted remote controllable mini flame thrower! Yay!  We all need one! Because there's no danger whatsoever to flinging tiny fireballs around! (If you're not an illusionist? You don't need this thing.)  A BACK MOUNTED flamethrower!  Flamethrowers are FUN! and illegal to own in California, the party-poopers are just too worried about burning all their drought-blighted forests. But hey, they might be considered fireworks and be illegal elsewhere, so be careful when setting your back yard and neighbors on fire, and remember, it's a super-power to be able to maim yourself and others with one of the most painful things ever, STICKY FIRE!!! YAY!!!!  Of course the thermal monocular telescopey thing (which gives you blurry thermal vision that doesn't look like the pictures shown) is possibly useful, as might be the area-effect noise cancelling device, if it actually works, but the commercial did not show us anything about what the ""pleasant sound profiles"" actually sound like, or how well the thing cancels real noise.  OK, so two of the things shown here might be worth looking up at a Not Sold On TV store, maybe. Probably wouldn't end up buying them though.",

Its not viable, GE had to get big ass speakers in order to un-ring a bell, just like you'd need to get big-ass speakers to un-ring someones phone in the next room.   2nd one is just a ""magic"" toy.  3rd one is a good concept, but not meant to be an acutal inflateable. If I where the maker of this I would have done a shirt or something instead of a wristband, as to get correct floatation it would mean you'd have one arm doing all the work most of the time.   4th one is cool, but its a weapon, and one that isn't even allowed to be used in wars.  5th one doesn't work as shown, as the images that they use to demonstrate say, and even then there are smartphone usb gadgets that can do the same thing, and in any real situations it won't be any more useful than a simple smart-phone flashlight, or any standard attatchment whilst hunting.",
