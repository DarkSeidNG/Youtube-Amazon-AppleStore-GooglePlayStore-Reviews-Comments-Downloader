Dad_a_Monk,"April 08, 2017",,"Laser glove is interesting...but that's not what the link goes to. It goes to the most geto made laser projector I've ever seen. Obviously not available on Amazon. (edit: For the impaired that keep making stupid comments...I don't want the glove in the video. I know who made it and where this guy stole the footage from. My WHOLE point is that it is NOT available on Amazon and the item he links to is a piece of junk and OBVIOUSLY not the glove from the video, nor does anyone think they are the same.)",
