BTW every single thing in existence is nature, WE are nature you knuckle dragging goofballs, computers are nature, smoking pot is nature, we arent seperate how can we be?, its only our arrogance that seperates ""us"" from ""nature"" . My point is i dont see why we have to follow one path of being plugged in slaves to computers in an endless sea of possible futures, i know technology solves most of our problems, but having a computer isnt the only education we can teach ourselves, we learn computer technology and dont excersise social relationships, or actually thinking for ourselves in these areas, computers wont solve social issues like relationships between races and religions, only human physical experience will solve that. i dont want a cold computer filled future where we have evolved for millions of years just to be workers for corporations, were already slaves. Look at the drudgery of your lives, i mean it, look at your daily routines, you really think we evolved for all those millenia just to do what we each do every single day until we die?.
