I learnt they say oloyede is a very stubborn man and he doesn't listen to advise. It is better to use offline method which ojerinde. Built and be successful. Just to register jamb candidate are traveling far from their home spent 4 days in CBT centers yet no success. You want to receive 1.5 million registration within 4 weeks, this is week 2 and you have 250,000 applicants. It means you are already a failure Prof oloyede. Let people generate their pins on Remita.
